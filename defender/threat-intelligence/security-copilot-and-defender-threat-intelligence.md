# Microsoft Copilot for Security and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence

Microsoft Copilot for Security is a cloud-based AI platform that provides natural language copilot experience. It can help support security professionals in different scenarios, like incident response, threat hunting, and intelligence gathering. For more information about what it can do, read [What is Microsoft Copilot for Security?](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot).

**Copilot for Security integrates with Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence**

Copilot for Security delivers information about threat actors, indicators of compromise (IOCs), tools, and vulnerabilities, as well as contextual threat intelligence from Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI). You can use the prompts and promptbooks to investigate incidents, enrich your hunting flows with threat intelligence information, or gain more knowledge about your organization's or the global threat landscape. 

This article introduces you to Copilot and includes sample prompts that can help Defender TI users.

## Know before you begin
- You can use Copilot capabilities to surface threat intelligence in either the [Copilot for Security portal](#using-copilot-for-security-standalone-portal-to-get-threat-intelligence) or the [Microsoft Defender portal](#using-microsoft-copilot-in-defender-to-get-threat-intelligence). [Learn more about Copilot for Security experiences](/security-copilot/experiences-security-copilot)
- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific threat actor names or IOCs in your prompts. It might also help if you add **threat intelligence** to your prompt, like:
  - Show me threat intelligence data for Aqua Blizzard.
  - Summarize threat intelligence data for "malicious.com."
- Be specific when referencing an incident (for example, "incident ID 15324").
- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.
- Copilot for Security saves your prompt sessions. To see the previous sessions, from the Copilot [Home menu](/security-copilot/navigating-security-copilot#home-menu), go to **My sessions**.

    ![Screenshot of the prompt bar in Microsoft Copilot for Security with the Sources icon highlighted.](media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-prompts-bar-sources.png)
  
  
    In the **Manage sources** pop-up window that appears, under **Plugins**, confirm that the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence** toggle is turned on, then close the window.

    ![Screenshot of the Manage plugins pop-up window with the Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence plugin highlighted.](media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-manage-plugins.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some roles can turn the toggle on or off for plugins like Defender TI. For more information, read [Manage plugins in Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/manage-plugins).

3. Enter your prompt in the prompt bar.

### Built-in system features

Copilot for Security has built-in system features that can get data from the different plugins that are turned on.

To view the list of built-in system capabilities for Defender TI:

1.	In the prompt bar, select the **Prompts** icon ![Screenshot of the prompts icon.](/defender/threat-intelligence/media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-prompts-icon.png).

      ![Screenshot of the prompt bar in Microsoft Copilot for Security with the Prompts icon highlighted.](media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-prompts-bar-prompts.png)

2.	Select **See all system capabilities**. The *Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence* section lists all the available capabilities for Defender TI that you can use.

Copilot also has the following promptbooks that also deliver information from Defender TI:
- **Threat actor profile** – Generates a report profiling a known threat actor, including suggestions to defend against their common tools and tactics.
- **Vulnerability impact assessment** – Generates a report summarizing the intelligence for a known vulnerability, including steps on how to address it.

To view these promptbooks, in the prompt bar, select the **Prompts** icon then select **See all promptbooks**.
