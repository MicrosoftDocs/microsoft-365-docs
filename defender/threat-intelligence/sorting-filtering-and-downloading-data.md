# Sorting, filtering, and downloading data

The Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) platform enables analysts to access our vast collection of crawling data in an indexed and pivot table format.  These data sets can be very large, returning expansive amounts of historic and recent data. Thus, allowing analysts to appropriately sort and filter the data provides the ability easily to surface the connections of interest.

In this how-to article, you’ll learn how to sort and filter data for the following data sets:

- Resolutions
- WHOIS
- Certificates
- Subdomains
- Trackers
- Components
- Host Pairs
- Hashes
- Cookies
- Services
- DNS
- Reverse DNS

For more information, see [Data sets](data-sets.md).

In this how-to article, you’ll also learn how to download indicators/artifacts from the following features:

- Projects
- Articles
- Data Sets

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Active Directory or personal Microsoft account. [Login or create an account](https://signup.microsoft.com/)
- A Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) Premium license.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Users without a Defender TI Premium license will still be able to log into the Defender Threat Intelligence Portal and access our free Defender TI offering.

## Open Defender TI’s Threat Intelligence Home Page

1. Access the [Defender Threat Intelligence Portal](https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/).
2. Complete Microsoft authentication to access portal.

## Sorting data

The sorting function on the Data tab enables users to quickly sort our datasets by the column values. By default, most results are sorted by “Last Seen” (descending) so that the most recently observed results appear at the top of the list; this surfaces the most recent data to immediately provide insight on the current infrastructure of an artifact. Currently, all data sets are sortable by the following “First Seen” and “Last Seen” values:

- Last Seen Descending (Default)
- Last Seen Ascending
- First Seen Ascending
- First Seen Descending

Data can be sorted across each data set blade within the Data tab for each IP, domain, or host entity that is searched or pivoted on.

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Apply sorting preferences to the First Seen and Last Seen columns within the Resolutions Data blade.

## Filtering data

Data filtering allows analysts to access a select group of data based on a particular metadata value. For instance, an analyst can select to only view IP resolutions discovered from a select source, or components of a particular type (e.g. servers, frameworks). This enables users to narrow the query results to items of particular interest. Since the Threat Intelligence platform provides specific metadata that coincides with particular data types, the filter options will be different for each data set.

## Resolution filters

The following filters apply to resolution data:

- **System Tag**: these tags are created by the Threat Intelligence system based on insights discovered by our research team.
- **Tag**: tags that have been applied by Threat Intelligence users.
- **ASN**: results that relate to a designated Autonomous System Number (ASN).
- **Network**: results that relate to designated network.
- **Source**: the data source that produced the result (e.g. riskiq, emerging_threats).

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Apply filters to each of the types of filter options noted above within the Resolutions Data blade.

## Tracker filters

The following filters apply to tracker data:

- **Type**: the identified tracker type for each artifact (e.g. JarmFuzzyHash, GoogleAnalyticsID).
- **Address**: the IP address that directly observed the tracker or has a resolving host that observed the tracker. (Appears when searching an IP address)
- **Hostname**: the host that observed this tracker value. (Appears when searching a domain or host)

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Navigate to the Trackers Data blade.
3. Apply filters to each of the types of filter options noted above within the Trackers Data blade.

## Component filters

The following filters apply to component data:

- **Ipaddressraw:** the IP address that coincides with the returned hostname.
- **Type:** the designated component type (e.g. remote access, operating system).
- **Name:** the name of the detected component (e.g. Cobalt Strike, PHP).

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Navigate to the Components Data blade.
3. Apply filters to each of the types of filter options noted above within the Components Data blade.

## Host pair filters

The following filters apply to host pair data:

- **Direction:** the direction of the observed connection. This indicates whether the parent redirects to the child or vice versa.
- **Parent Hostname:** the hostname of the parent artifact.
- **Cause:** the detected cause of the host parent / child relationship (e.g. redirect, iframe.src).
- **Child Hostname:** the hostname of the child artifact.

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Navigate to the Host Pairs Data blade.
3. Apply filters to each of the types of filter options noted above within the Host Pairs Data blade.

## DNS & Reverse DNS filters

The following filters apply to DNS and Reverse DNS data:

- **Record Type:** the type of record detected in the DNS record (e.g. NS, CNAME).
- **Value:** the designated value of the record (e.g. nameserver.host.com).

1. Search a domain, IP address, or host in the Defender TI Threat Intelligence search bar and navigate to the Data tab.
2. Navigate to the DNS and later, Reverse DNS Data blades.
3. Apply filters to each of the types of filter options noted above within the DNS and Reverse DNS Data blades.

## Downloading data

In Defender TI, there are various sections that a user can download data as a csv export.   Users need to look out for the download icon to export data as a csv.

![Download Icon](media/downloadIcon.png)

Data can be downloaded within the following sections:

- Most Data Set blades
- Project
