# Using Microsoft Copilot for Security for threat intelligence

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Microsoft Copilot in Defender applies the capabilities of [Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) to deliver Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) information about threat actors and tools, as well as contextual threat intelligence, directly into the Microsoft Defender portal. Based on threat analytics reports, intel profiles, and other available Defender TI content, you can use Copilot in Defender to summarize the latest threats affecting your organization, know which threats to prioritize based on your exposure level, or gain more knowledge about your organization's or the global threat landscape.

> [!NOTE]

2. In the Copilot prompt bar, ask about a threat actor, attack campaign, or any other threat intelligence that you want to know more about, then select the **Send message** icon ![Screenshot of the Send message icon in Copilot in Defender.](media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-defender-arrow.png) or press **Enter**.

If you wish to go back or continue a previous session, go to the Copilot for Security standalone portal.

## Use the built-in Defender TI prompts

Copilot in Defender also has the following built-in prompts when accessing the *Threat intelligence* pages to get you started:

- [Summarize](#summarize-the-latest-threats-related-to-your-organization)
- [Prioritize](#prioritize-which-threats-to-focus-on)
- [Ask](#ask-about-the-threat-actors-targeting-the-communications-infrastructure)

:::image type="content" source="/defender/threat-intelligence/media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-defender-prompts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Defender portal Threat analytics page with the built-in prompts in the open Copilot in Defender side pane highlighted." lightbox="/defender/threat-intelligence/media/defender-ti-and-copilot/copilot-defender-prompts.png":::

### Summarize the latest threats related to your organization
Gathering and digesting threat intelligence data and trends can be a daunting task, especially when they come from multiple data sets and sources. Choose the **Summarize** prompt if you want Copilot to give you an overview of the latest threats in your environment. Copilot lists and summarizes relevant campaigns, activities, and threat actors, and includes links to related threat analytics reports or intel profiles for more information.

### Prioritize which threats to focus on
Copilot provides insights on which threats you should prioritize and focus on based on your environment's highest exposure level to these threats. Choose the **Prioritize** prompt if you want to find out which threats are likely to significantly impact your organization. This prompt gives you a starting point and could thus make triaging, investigating, and mitigating incidents less complex.

### Ask about the threat actors targeting the communications infrastructure

An important aspect of threat intelligence is keeping up to date with the global threat landscape. Choose the **Ask** prompt if you want Copilot to summarize the latest threat articles about threat actors that target the communications infrastructure so you can gather information on their latest TTPs or campaigns, and promptly assess and apply mitigation or prevention strategies.
