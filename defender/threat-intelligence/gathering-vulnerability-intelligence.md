## Prerequisites

- An Azure Active Directory or personal Microsoft account. [Login or create an account](https://signup.microsoft.com/)
- A Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) Premium license.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users without a Defender TI Premium license will still be able to log into the Defender Threat Intelligence Portal and access our free Defender TI offering.

## Disclaimer

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) may include live, real-time observations and threat indicators, including malicious infrastructure and adversary-threat tooling. Any IP and domain searches within our Defender TI platform are safe to search.
Microsoft will share online resources (e.g., IP addresses, domain names) that should be considered real threats posing a clear and present danger.
We ask that users use their best judgment and minimize unnecessary risk while interacting with malicious systems when performing the tutorial below. Please note that Microsoft has worked to minimize risk by defanging malicious IP addresses, hosts, and domains.

## Before You Begin

As the disclaimer states above, suspicious, and malicious indicators have been defanged for your safety. Please remove any brackets from IPs, domains, and hosts when searching in Defender TI. Do not search these indicators directly in your browser.

## Open Defender TI’s Threat Intelligence Home Page

- Access the [Defender Threat Intelligence Portal](https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/).
