# Provide user feedback for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is a product that helps users boost their productivity with large-language models (LLM). While Copilot is designed to provide accurate and informative responses based on the knowledge and data available in the Microsoft Graph, it's important to note that answers may not always be completely accurate. This is because Copilot generates responses based on patterns and probabilities in language data. Providing feedback is essential to improve the product and make it more dependable for users.

Copilot for Microsoft 365 currently allows user-initiated feedback. As an admin, you can give feedback to supplement the user-initiated process. This helps Microsoft receive comprehensive diagnostic data to aid in debugging, especially in cases where users may not be able to provide feedback themselves. By providing feedback on behalf of your users, you can help enhance the overall experience of Copilot for your organization by improving the quality and relevance of its responses.

This article explains how you can initiate feedback on behalf of your users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

- A Microsoft 365 subscription with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 license

- Global Admin role to complete the task in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

- An email address of the user who experienced an issue with Copilot for Microsoft 365.

3. Enter the email address of the user who reported the issue. Then, choose the number of rounds of conversations that you’d like to share with Microsoft, and then select **Review**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The maximum number of conversations you can share is 30.

4. After a short wait, you’ll receive a JSON file containing the user's conversations with Copilot for the past X interactions (utterance/response pairs) that you select, along with their feedback logs. The file will be redacted to protect Microsoft IP, if any. You can use any JSON viewer tool to inspect the data and include additional comments for the feedback. The file will be available for download once it's generated.

5. Decide whether or not to move forward with the feedback submission to Microsoft. If you choose to share the data, select **Submit**. If you don’t want to share the data, select **Cancel**.

6. If you select, **Submit**, the log files will be sent to Microsoft along with your consent and you’ll see a confirmation message. If you select **Cancel**, no data will be sent to Microsoft, and you’ll see cancellation message. Microsoft doesn’t collect anything before you select **Submit**.

7. Once you select **Submit**, the user who you submitted feedback on behalf of receives an automatic email from Microsoft to inform them about the feedback submission.
