### Licenses

You can manage Copilot licenses, including assigning and unassigning licenses, for your users.

### Manage how your organization interacts with Copilot in Bing, Edge, and Windows

Copilot with commercial data protection provides enhanced security for users accessing the generative AI capabilities of Copilot. This experience is on by default for users when they are signed in and using a Microsoft 365 E3, E5, A3, or A5 license assigned by your organization.

Copilot in Bing, Edge and Windows is the public version of Copilot and doesn’t require users to be signed in. You can reroute to the documentation available on the panel to turn off the public experience and still have access to the Copilot with commercial data protection experience.

### Manage plugins that work with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is powered by an advanced processing and orchestration engine that seamlessly integrates Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Graph, and large language models (LLMs) to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool. While Copilot is already able to use the apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many users still depend on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. You can extend Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 by building a plugin or by connecting to an external data source.
