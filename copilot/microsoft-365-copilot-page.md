# Manage Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 with the Copilot page

You can manage Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 through the Microsoft 365 admin center by using the Copilot page. Use the Copilot page to review licensing, get the latest information, and to view additional resources. You can also manage how users in your organization interact with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, Security Copilot, and more.

## Before you begin

- Your organization must have purchased Copilot licenses to access the Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. While you don't need a license assigned to your admin account, you must have these licenses present within the organization for the Copilot page to be visible. For more information, see [Get started with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](microsoft-365-copilot-setup.md).

- You must be a Global Administrator to access the Copilot page. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## How to get to the Copilot page

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

2. In the left navigation, select **Copilot**.

### Licenses

You can manage Copilot licenses, including assigning and unassigning licenses, for your users.

### Manage how your organization interacts with Copilot in Bing, Edge, and Windows

Copilot with commercial data protection provides enhanced security for users accessing the generative AI capabilities of Copilot. This experience is on by default for users when they are signed in and using a Microsoft 365 E3, E5, A3, A5, Business Standard, or Business Premium license assigned by your organization.

Copilot in Bing, Edge and Windows is the public version of Copilot and doesn’t require users to be signed in. You can reroute to the documentation available on the panel to turn off the public experience and still have access to the Copilot with commercial data protection experience.

You'll soon have the ability to control access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows using a PowerShell script. By running this script, you can manage access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing.com, Edge sidebar, Edge mobile app, Copilot in Windows, copilot.microsoft.com, and the Copilot app. However, this will not affect how users access Copilot in other Microsoft 365 apps.

>[!NOTE]
> The PowerShell script download link and run commands will be available in late February 2024. If you want to configure Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows after late February, return to this page for further instructions.

### Manage plugins that work with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is powered by an advanced processing and orchestration engine that seamlessly integrates Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Graph, and large language models (LLMs) to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool. While Copilot is already able to use the apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many users still depend on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. You can extend Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 by building a plugin or by connecting to an external data source.
