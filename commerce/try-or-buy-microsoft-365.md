# Try or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription

Microsoft 365 is a complete solution that combines Office 365 and Windows 10 with advanced security and device management. If you already have a subscription and you want to trial or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription, the best way to do it is through the admin center. The following Microsoft 365 subscriptions are available in the admin center for you to try or buy now:
  
- Microsoft 365 Business

- Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3

- Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5

When you add a subscription through the admin center, the new subscription is associated with the same organization (domain namespace) as your existing subscription. This makes it easier to move users in your organization between subscriptions, or to assign them a license for the additional subscription they need.
