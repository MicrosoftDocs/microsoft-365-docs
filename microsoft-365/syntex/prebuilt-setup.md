# Set up and manage prebuilt document processing in Microsoft Syntex

The prebuilt document processing service for Microsoft Syntex is set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use prebuilt document processing in Syntex, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). Prebuilt document processing in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up prebuilt document processing in Syntex.  

## Set up prebuilt document processing

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), prebuilt document processing will be automatically set up and enabled for all SharePoint sites.

## Manage sites

By default, prebuilt document processing is turned on for libraries in all SharePoint sites. Follow these steps to manage which SharePoint sites users can use to create prebuilt models to process files.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>, and then select **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex**.

2. On the **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Manage Microsoft Syntex**. 

3. On the **Manage Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Prebuilt document processing**.

4. On the **Prebuilt document processing** page:

    a. Choose which site or sites this service should be enabled for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Disabling a site after a model is made available to process files on that site will not disable the model. Models can still be used to process files and incur charges. A model can be made available to process files by being created on that site or in a content center.

    b. To restrict the sites where users can create models, select **No sites** or **Selected sites** and follow the instructions to either select the sites or upload a CSV listing a maximum of 100 sites. Be sure to add your content center site if you want it to be included. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For multi-geo environments, the **No sites** and **Selected sites** settings apply only to the primary geo of multi-geo tenants. If you want to restrict or add sites in non-primary geos, contact Microsoft support.

    c. Select **Save**.
