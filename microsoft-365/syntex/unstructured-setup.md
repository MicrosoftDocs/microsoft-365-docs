# Set up and manage unstructured document processing in Microsoft Syntex

Before you can use unstructured document processing in Microsoft Syntex, it must be set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use unstructured document processing in Syntex, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). Unstructured document processing in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up unstructured document processing in Syntex.  

## Set up unstructured document processing

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), unstructured document processing will be automatically set up and enabled for all SharePoint sites.

## Manage sites

Manage which SharePoint sites users can use to create custom models to process files.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>, and then select **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex**.

2. On the **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Manage Microsoft Syntex**.

3. On the **Manage Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Unstructured document processing**.

4. On the **Unstructured document processing** page:

    a. Choose which site or sites this service should be enabled for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Disabling a site after a model is made available to process files on that site will not disable the model. Models can still be used to process files and incur charges. A model can be made available to process files by being created either on that site or in a content center.

    b. To restrict user access to this service, select **No sites** or **Selected sites** and follow the instructions to either select the sites or upload a CSV listing a maximum of 100 sites. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected.

    c. Select **Save**.
