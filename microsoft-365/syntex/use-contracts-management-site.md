# Use the contracts management site template for Microsoft Syntex

> [!NOTE]
>  The latest version of the contracts management site template is now available as a [team site template directly from SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/80820115-c700-4a62-bb59-69b33c8e3b4f). The look book version of this site template is no longer being updated.

The contracts management site is a ready-to-deploy and customizable SharePoint site template that helps your organization maximize the value of Microsoft Syntex. The site is designed to let you create a professional site to manage, process, and track the status of contracts in your organization.

## Features of the site

The contracts management site includes pre-populated pages, web parts, and site navigation. The site can be customized to incorporate your organization's own branding, employee information, policy and planning information, workflow, contacts, and resources.

The site uses the power of a Syntex model running on a SharePoint document library to classify documents and extract metadata. The site provides prebuilt document libraries to get you started quickly, but you can also create your own as needed. The site includes the following featured libraries:

- **Regions** – Classify contract documents by geographical area, country, or region.

- **Templates** – Select the appropriate contract template for the type of contract, such as non-disclosure agreements, service agreements, and statements of work.

- **Contract requests** – Launch a contract request directly to your contracts team.

- **Clients** – Find client information in one convenient location.

- **Models** – Use the model in this library to classify documents and extract metadata. Users can create their own models to fit their needs and add them to this library.

- **Sample contracts library** – Find files that were classified and have had metadata extracted using the Syntex model. 

There is a separate view in the library where you can track other metadata such as status, and that uses document library formatting to show it in a more visual way.

## Provision the site

The contracts management site can be provisioned from the [SharePoint look book service](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/).
