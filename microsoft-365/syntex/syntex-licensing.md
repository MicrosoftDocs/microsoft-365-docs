# Licensing for Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex has two types of licensing:

- [Microsoft Syntex pay-as-you-go](#microsoft-syntex-pay-as-you-go)
- [SharePoint Syntex per-user licensing](#microsoft-syntex-per-user-licensing)

The features available for each license type are described in this article. <!-- You can use both licenses if you need to.-->

In the future, most new Microsoft Syntex features will be added to pay-as-you-go.

> [!NOTE] 
> Microsoft Syntex is an add-on and requires users also to have a license for Microsoft 365.

> [!NOTE] 
> For Government Community Cloud (GCC) organizations, pay-as-you-go licensing is not yet available. GCC organizations can continue to purchase and use per-user licenses until pay-as-you-go becomes available.

## Microsoft Syntex pay-as-you-go

Pay-as-you-go is a way to pay for Microsoft Syntex using an Azure subscription. You can use Microsoft Syntex without any license commitment or upfront purchasing. Pay-as-you-go supports the following Microsoft Syntex services:

- Prebuilt document processing
- Unstructured document processing
- Content assembly
- Image tagging
- Taxonomy tagging
- Optical character recognition

All users in your organization are able to create and apply unstructured and prebuilt document processing models and can upload documents to a primed library. This service is charged on a pay-per-use basis.

### Feature limited preview

Pay-as-you-go licensing includes access to additional Syntex features for a limited time as a preview. You won't be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis during the preview. These features include:

- Content query
- Universal annotations
- Contracts management accelerator
- Accounts payable accelerator
- Taxonomy features (including import using SKOS, SKOS formatting reference, push content type to hub, and term store reports)
- PDF merge and extract pages
- Content processing: Move or copy a file, set a content type from file name

For more information, see [Microsoft Syntex features limited time license agreement](feature-limited-license.md).

## Microsoft Syntex per-user licensing

> [!NOTE]
> As of July 1, 2023, per-user licenses are no longer available for purchase. You will need to [set up pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md).<br><br>
> **Per-user licenses purchased before July 1, 2023, can still be assigned to new users.** After existing per-user licenses expire, you will need to opt-in to Syntex [pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md).

To use Syntex, you must have a license for each Syntex user. If you remove all Syntex per-user licenses from your tenant at a future date (or your trial expires), users won't be able to create, publish, or run custom models. Additionally, term store reports, SKOS taxonomy import, and content type push won't be available. Models, content, or metadata won't be deleted, and site permissions won't be changed.

#### Tasks requiring a per-user license
 
The following tasks require a [Syntex per-user license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/sharepoint-syntex) for the user performing them:
 
- Apply an unstructured document processing model to a library. (Unlicensed users can be granted access to a content center and can create models there, but can't apply them to a document library.)
- Create a structured document processing model or a freeform document processing model via the entry point in a library.
- Upload content to a library where a custom model has been applied.
- Run an unstructured document processing model on-demand.
- Use of content query to search for metadata.
- Use of annotations to add notes and comments.
- Use of premium taxonomy services. (Premium taxonomy services comprise SKOS-based term set import, pushing enterprise content types to hub-associated sites, and term store reports.)
- Use the document library rules to move or copy content.
- Merge and extract PDFs.

Unlicensed users can be granted access to a content center and can create models there, but can't apply them to a document library.
 
#### Cost of training and running models
 
The cost of training and running unstructured document processing models is included in the cost of a Syntex per-user license. However, the structured document processing and freeform document processing models use AI Builder capacity, for both training and runtime processing. Capacity must be allocated to the Power Apps environment where you use AI Builder.

For each Syntex per-user license, you're allocated 3,500 AI Builder credits per license, per month pooled at the tenant level, with a maximum allocation of 1 million credits per month. This allocation is renewed each month for each active Syntex per-user license. (Unused credits don't roll over from month to month.)

You can estimate the AI Builder capacity thatâ€™s right for you with the [AI Builder calculator](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder-calculator).

If you plan to use a custom Power Platform environment, you must [allocate credits to that environment](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on).

Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/resources/capacity) to check your credits and usage.
  
#### Additional term store features

Having one or more Syntex per-user licenses in your organization enables the following additional term store features for SharePoint admins:
 
- SKOS-based term set import
- Push enterprise content types to a hub site, which also adds them to the associated sites and any newly created lists or libraries
- Term store reports providing insights into published term sets and their use across your tenant
