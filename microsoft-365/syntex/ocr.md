# Set up and manage optical character recognition in Microsoft Syntex

Before you can use the optical character recognition (OCR) service in Microsoft Syntex, it must be set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use the OCR service in Syntex, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). OCR in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up the OCR service in Syntex.

## Set up optical character recognition

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), OCR will be automatically set up and enabled for all SharePoint sites for Syntex.

### Set up data loss prevention policies using OCR

The compliance admin for your organization can also [configure the OCR settings for your tenant](../compliance/ocr-learn-about.md?#phase-3-configure-your-ocr-settings) for [data loss prevention policies](../compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp.md) in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

The compliance admin can specify which SharePoint sites to include for data loss prevention. If there are different sites specified for Syntex and data loss prevention, the maximum number of sites will be enabled for OCR. You won't be charged twice for processing.

For more information, see [Learn about optical character recognition in Microsoft Purview](../compliance/ocr-learn-about.md).

## Manage sites enabled for Syntex

Manage which SharePoint sites have OCR enabled for Syntex in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>, and then select **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex**.

2. On the **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Manage Microsoft Syntex**. 

3. On the **Manage Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Optical character recognition**.

4. On the **Optical character recognition** page:

    a. Choose which site or sites this service should be enabled for.

    b. To restrict user access to this service, select **No sites** or **Selected sites** and follow the instructions to either select the sites or upload a CSV listing a maximum of 100 sites. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected.

    c. Select **Save**.
