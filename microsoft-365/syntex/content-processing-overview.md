# Overview of content processing in Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex lets you build simple rules-driven actions in document libraries based on metadata. From a document library, you can create rules to automate tasks such as sending a notification when metadata changes in a file, when a new file is created in the library, or when files are moved or copied based on metadata extracted by Syntex models.

You'll choose a condition that triggers the rule and the action that the rule will take. 
For example, you can create a rule to move files tagged with a specific customer to a specific library or folder. These rules help you structure your content architecture with the power of AI-driven processing.
