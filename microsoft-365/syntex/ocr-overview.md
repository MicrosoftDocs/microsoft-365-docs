# Overview of optical character recognition in Microsoft Syntex

> [!NOTE]
> Through June 2024, you can try out optical character recognition and other selected Syntex services at no cost if you have [pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md) set up. For information and limitations, see [Try out Microsoft Syntex and explore its services](promo-syntex.md).

The optical character recognition (OCR) service in Microsoft Syntex lets you extract printed or handwritten text from images and documents. Examples of images include posters, drawings, and product labels. Examples of documents include articles, reports, forms, and invoices.

The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. The extracted information is indexed in search and can be made available for compliance features like [data loss prevention (DLP)](../compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp.md).

For example, you enable the OCR service and then add image files to your document library. Microsoft Syntex automatically scans the image files, extracts the relevant text, and makes the text from the images available for search and indexing. This feature lets you quickly and accurately find the keywords and phrases you're looking for.
