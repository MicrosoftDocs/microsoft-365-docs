# Set up and manage structured and freeform document processing in Microsoft Syntex

The structured and freeform document processing service for Microsoft Syntex is set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use structured and freeform document processing in Syntex, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). Structured and freeform document processing in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must be a [SharePoint Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) or [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up structured and freeform document processing.

[!INCLUDE [global-administrator-note](../includes/global-administrator-note.md)]

## Set up structured and freeform document processing

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), structured and freeform document processing will be automatically set up and enabled for all SharePoint sites.

## Manage sites

By default, structured and default document processing is turned on for libraries in all SharePoint sites. Follow these steps to limit on which sites users can create custom models to process files.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>.

2. Under **Files and content**, select **Automate content processes with Syntex**.

3. On the **Automate content processes with Syntex** page, select **Go to Syntex settings**.

4. On the Syntex page, in the **Document & image services** section, select **Structured and freeform document processing**.

5. On the **Structured and freeform document processing** panel:

    a. On the **Sites** tab, choose the site or sites on which this service should be enabled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Disabling a site after a model is made available to process files on that site will not disable the model. Models can still be used to process files and incur charges. A model can be made available to process files by being created either on that site or in a content center.

    b. To restrict user access to this service, under **Sites where models can be created**, select **Edit**. On the **Sites where models can be created** panel, select **No sites** or **Selected sites (up to 100)** and follow the instructions to either select the sites or upload a CSV file listing a maximum of 100 sites. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected. If you don't want the service available on any sites, select **No sites**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must be a member of any site that you want to include in the CSV file.

    c. Select **Save**.

## Turn off structured and freeform document processing

When the structured and freeform document processing service is turned off, structured and freeform models won't run, and users won't be able to create or apply structured or freeform models.

Follow these steps to turn off structured and freeform document processing.

1. On the **Structured and freeform document processing** panel, on the **Settings** tab, turn the **Status** to **Off**.

2. On the **Turn off structured and freeform document processing?** panel, select **Turn off**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For multi-geo environments, when the service is turned off, the service is off for all geos.

## Using a Power Platform environment

### Set up a default Power Platform environment

Your tenant comes with a default Power Platform environment. To make the default environment ready for to use with Microsoft Syntex, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) as a Global Administrator, a Power Platform Administrator, or a Dynamics 365 Administrator.

2. Select the checkmark next to the default environment.

3. In the **Dataverse** column, verify that the value is **Yes**.

    - If the value is **No**, add Dataverse to the environment:

        1. On the command bar, select **Add Dataverse** and then confirm the action.

        2. Refresh the page until the **State** column  is **Ready.**

    - If the value is **Yes**, go to the next step.

4. On the command bar, select **Membership**. On the **System Administrators** panel, select **Add me**, and then select **Close**.

5. On the command bar, select **Resources** > **Dynamics 365 apps**. The Dynamics 365 apps page for the default environment opens.

6. Verify that the **AI Builder for Project Cortex** app is installed.

    - If **AI Builder for Project Cortex** isn't on the installed apps list, on the command bar, select **Install app**.

    - If **AI Builder for Project Cortex** is already on the installed apps list and the **Status** column shows **Installed**, the remaining steps can be skipped.

    - If **AI Builder for Project Cortex** is on the installed apps list, but the **Status** column shows **Installation failed**, then select the status text to view the error details. On the **Error details** panel, select **Retry installation**.

7. On the **Install Dynamic 365 app** panel, select **AI Builder for Project Cortex**, and then select **Next**.

8. On the **Install AI Builder for Project Cortex** panel, agree to the terms of service, and then select **Install**.

9. Wait for the app to install, and then refresh the page until the **Status** column shows **Installed**.

### Set up a custom Power Platform environment

If you plan to use a custom Power Platform environment, you must install the *AI Builder for Project Cortex* app in this environment. See [Manage Dynamics 365 apps](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#install-an-app-in-the-environment-view) for details and look for the *AI Builder for Project Cortex* app in the list of Dynamics 365 apps. The environment must not be of the Sandbox type.

If you have [AI Builder credits available](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on) to the environment, these credits are used first. For both custom and default Power Platform environments, once the credits are exhausted, the processing transactions are charged to the meter.

When using a custom environment, model creators must be assigned the Environment Maker security role. Model users must have permission to use (not edit) the model file in SharePoint libraries. For more information, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles). Custom security roles can be created to specifically grant access to the AI Builder tables as the Environment Maker role so those users can create models. You don't need to assign users this role if you're using the default Power Platform environment.
