# Train a freeform document processing model in Microsoft Syntex

Follow the instructions in [Create a model in Syntex](create-syntex-model.md) to create a freeform document processing model in a content center. Or, follow the instructions in [Create a model on a local SharePoint site](create-local-model.md) to create the model on a local site. Then use this article to train your model.

To train a freeform document processing model, follow these steps:

 - [Step 1: Add and analyze documents](#step-1-add-and-analyze-documents)
 - [Step 2: Tag fields and tables](#step-2-tag-fields-and-tables)
 - [Step 3: Train and publish your model](#step-3-train-and-publish-your-model)
 - [Step 4: Use your model](#step-4-use-your-model)

## Step 1: Add and analyze documents

After you create your structured document processing model, the **Choose information to extract** page opens. Here you list all pieces of information that you want the AI model to extract from your documents, such as Name, Address, or Amount.  

> [!NOTE]
> When you look for example files to use, see the [document processing model input document requirements and optimization tips](/ai-builder/form-processing-model-requirements). 
 
1. You first define the fields and tables you want to teach your model to extract on the **Choose information to extract** page. For detailed steps, see [Define fields and tables to extract](/ai-builder/create-form-processing-model#define-fields-and-tables-to-extract). 

2.  You can create as many collections of document layouts you want your model to process. For detailed steps, see [Group documents by collections](/ai-builder/create-form-processing-model#group-documents-by-collections). 

3. After you create your collections and add at least five example files for each, AI Builder on Syntex will examine the uploaded documents to detect the fields and tables. This process usually takes a few seconds. When the analysis is complete, you can proceed with tagging the documents.

## Step 2: Tag fields and tables

You need to tag the documents to teach the model to understand the fields and table data you want to extract. For detailed steps, see [Tag documents](/ai-builder/create-form-processing-model#tag-documents).

## Step 3: Train and publish your model

1. After you create and train your model, you're ready to publish it and use it in SharePoint. To publish the model, select **Publish**. For detailed steps, see [Train and publish your document processing model](/ai-builder/form-processing-train). 

    ![Screenshot in showing the model details on the model home page.](../media/content-understanding/ai-builder-create-a-flow-1.png)

2. After the model is published, you will go to the model home page. You'll then have the option to apply the model to a document library.

## Step 4: Use your model

1. In the document library model view, notice that the fields you selected now display as columns.

    ![Screenshot showing document library model applied.](../media/content-understanding/doc-lib-view.png)

2. Notice that the information link next to **Documents** notes that a forms processing model is applied to this document library.

3. Upload files to your document library. Any files that the model identifies as its content type lists the files in your view and displays the extracted data in the columns.

    ![Screenshot showing process is done.](../media/content-understanding/doc-lib-done.png) 

> [!NOTE]
> If a freeform or structured document processing model and an unstructured document processing model are applied to the same library, the file is classified using the unstructured document processing model and any trained extractors for that model. If there are any empty columns that match the freeform or structured document processing model, the columns will be populated using those extracted values.

### Classification Date field

When a Syntex custom model is applied to a document library, the **Classification Date** field is included in the library schema. By default, this field is empty. However, when documents are processed and classified by a model, this field is updated with a date-time stamp of completion. 

When a model is stamped with the **Classification Date**, you can use the **Send an email after Syntex processes a file** flow to notify users that a new file has been processed and classified by a model in the SharePoint document library.

To run the flow:

1. Select a file, and then select **Integrate** > **Power Automate** > **Create a flow**.

2. On the **Create a flow** panel, select **Send an email after Syntex processes a file**.
