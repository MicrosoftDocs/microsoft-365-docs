# Privacy, security, and compliance in Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft is transparent about the specific policies, operational practices, and technologies that help you ensure the privacy, security, and compliance of your data across Microsoft Syntex.

- Microsoft respects the privacy and ownership of data you use to train and process models in Microsoft Syntex.

- None of your organization's data is used or transferred by Microsoft to train AI models, large-language models, or any other models.

- Your data remains securely within your organization’s tenant.

## Privacy

Privacy is built into all Microsoft Syntex experiences. Microsoft Syntex services adhere to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and follow Microsoft's compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) and the [Microsoft EU Data Boundary](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb).

Microsoft Syntex inherits privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.

### GDPR compliance

Microsoft Syntex supports compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) (GDPR) requirements.

### Data residency

Data residency refers to the geographic location where data is stored at rest. The way that data is transferred and stored in Microsoft Syntex is defined in the [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) (DPA).

All data within Microsoft Syntex is stored within the customer tenant for any given service and follows the standard Microsoft 365 data storage guidelines by available geography.

## Security

Microsoft Syntex works with and integrates into Microsoft 365. This means that the Microsoft 365 security capabilities—such role-based access, identity and app management, and others—apply to Microsoft Syntex.

## Compliance

Microsoft offers a [comprehensive set of compliance offerings](/compliance) to help your organization comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use and data.

Microsoft Syntex is also covered under the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Product-Terms) and [Data Protection Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA?year=2021#:%7E:text=Microsoft%20Products%20and%20Services%20Data%20Protection%20Addendum%20%28DPA%29,to%20the%20Product%20Terms%20site%20%28and%20formerly%20OST%29) (DPA).
