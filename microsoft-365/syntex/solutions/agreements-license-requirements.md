# Licensing requirements for SharePoint Agreements AI

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint Agreements AI is now generally available for early access customers. The licensing model is still being finalized, but early access customers can get trial licenses for **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** to use SharePoint Agreements AI. These trial licenses are valid for six months from date of activation. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit your nomination here to obtain trial licenses: [Sign up for limited GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA). If your nomination is selected, a Microsoft representative will reach out to you within 14 business days.

To activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution in your tenant, the tenant administrator must first get the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** license. After you obtain the license, you need to assign the license to users who will use the solution within your organization.

## Get the license

SharePoint Agreements AI is now generally available for early adoption customers. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit your nomination here to obtain licenses: [Sign up for selective GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA).

## Assign the license to users

Once the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** licenses are available in the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can assign licenses to existing users by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users). Users who need to use SharePoint Agreements AI need to have the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** license assigned to them.
