# Microsoft Syntex Optical Character Recognition (“OCR”) Feature Preview Agreement 

**<ins>The purpose of this Agreement</ins>**. We intend to enter discussions in which Company may provide input in connection with Microsoft offerings as described below. This Agreement clarifies our respective rights and obligations regarding that input. We agree that Company providing or Microsoft using input is voluntary.  

Input is all suggestions, comments, feedback, ideas, or know how, in any form, that Company provides to Microsoft. It doesn't include sales forecasts, financial results, future release scheduled, marketing plans and high-level product plans or feature lists for anticipated products.

**MICROSOFT OFFERING:**

The optical character recognition (OCR) service in Microsoft Syntex lets you extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, drawings, and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices.   Syntex OCR uses AI to extract text from customers' images, whether in OneDrive and SharePoint, Exchange emails, or Teams messages. This text extraction is done on a pay-as-you-go basis (each page of an image costs $0.001) using the latest tech from Azure Cognitive Services.  Global and SharePoint admins can configure Syntex OCR in the Microsoft Admin Center, and Compliance admins can also configure OCR in Microsoft Purview as they may need the capability for different scenarios and/or not want to leave Purview admin. The Syntex OCR service will honor settings from either admin experience, keeping the extracted text and not charging the customer twice even if it's configured in multiple places within admin.

The OCR service supports more than [150 languages](/azure/ai-services/language-support).

**FEATURE PREVIEW:**  Company agrees that by using this Preview Feature Company has accepted these terms. To terminate this Preview, don't use the Preview Feature.  Microsoft may change or discontinue the Preview Feature at any time with or without notice.  Microsoft may also choose not to make the Preview Feature generally commercially available.

No SLA applies to this Feature Preview.

THE PREVIEW FEATURE IS PROVIDED “AS-IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  Microsoft provides no performance guarantee for the Feature Preview (including accompanying URLs provided for embedded or unauthenticated viewing) and Company bears the risk of using it.  The Feature Preview isn't included in the SLA for Microsoft Syntex and may not be covered by customer support.

**<ins>LICENSE</ins>**

If Company provides Input, including feedback, Company grants to Microsoft, without charge, the nonexclusive License to make, modify, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Input as part of any Microsoft offering.

Company retains all right, title and interest in and to the Input.  The above License doesn't extend to any technologies that may also be necessary to make or use any offering or portion thereof that incorporates the Input but aren't themselves expressly part of the Input (for example, enabling technologies).  

**<ins>PAYMENT TERMS</ins>**

Syntex OCR services use pay-as-you-go billing through an Azure subscription. Syntex OCR services billing is determined the number of pages processed for images (JPEG, JPG, PNG, or BMP); the number of pages processed for PDF, TIF, or TIFF; or the number of embedded images in Teams chats and email messages. Each of these counts as one transaction. Processing occurs every time the file is edited. Company will be able to view this usage as meter events through the Azure subscription it chooses.

**<ins>Data Processing and Transfers</ins>**

To the extent Microsoft is a processor of Personal Data subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the GDPR Terms set forth in Attachment 1 govern that processing and the parties also agree to the following terms. For the purpose of this section, the term “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person:  

a) Processing Details. The parties acknowledge and agree that:

&emsp;i. The subject-matter of the processing is limited to Personal Data within the scope of GDPR;

&emsp;ii. The duration of the processing shall be for the duration of the Company’s right to participate in the Feature Preview Program and until all Personal Data is deleted or returned in accordance with Company instructions or this Agreement;

&emsp;iii. The nature and purpose of the processing shall be to provide the Syntex OCR services pursuant to the Agreement;

&emsp;i. Company’s data, and Personal Data that Microsoft processes on Customer’s behalf may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its Subprocessors operate. Company appoints Microsoft to perform any such transfer of Company data and Personal Data to any such country and to store and process data and Personal Data to provide the Syntex OCR services.

&emsp;ii. Microsoft will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention and other processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland.

For purposes of these GDPR Terms, Company and Microsoft agree that Company is the controller of Personal Data and Microsoft is the processor of such data, except when Company acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case Microsoft is a subprocessor. These GDPR Terms apply to the processing of Personal Data, within the scope of the GDPR, by Microsoft on behalf of Company. These GDPR Terms don't limit or reduce any data protection commitments Microsoft makes to Company in other agreements between Microsoft and Company. These GDPR Terms don't apply where Microsoft is a controller of Personal Data.

**Relevant GDPR Obligations: Articles 28, 32, and 33**

1) Microsoft shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorization of Company. In the case of general written authorization, Microsoft shall inform Company of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving Company the opportunity to object to such changes. (Article 28(2)) 

2) Processing by Microsoft shall be governed by these GDPR Terms under European Union (hereafter “Union”) or Member State law and are binding on Microsoft with regard to Company. The subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the Company are set forth in the Agreement, including these GDPR Terms. In particular, Microsoft shall:  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from Company, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which Microsoft is subject; in such a case, Microsoft shall inform Company of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. ensure that persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c. take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;d. respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 for engaging another processor;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;e. taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Company by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the Company’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR;

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;f. assist Company in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to Microsoft;

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;g. at the choice of Company, delete or return all the Personal Data to Company after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;h. make available to Company all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Company or another auditor mandated by Company.  

3) Microsoft shall immediately inform Company if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. (Article 28(3)) 

4) Where Microsoft engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of Company, the same data protection obligations as set out in these GDPR Terms shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. Where that other processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, Microsoft shall remain fully liable to the Company for the performance of that other processor's obligations. (Article 28(4)) 

5) Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Company and Microsoft shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. the pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c. the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;d. a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. (Article 32(1))

6) In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. (Article 32(2))

7) Company and Microsoft shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of Company or Microsoft who has access to Personal Data doesn't process them except on instructions from Company, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. (Article 32(4))

8) Microsoft shall notify Company without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach. (Article 33(2)). Such notification will include that information a processor must provide to a controller under Article 33(3) to the extent such information is reasonably available to Microsoft.
