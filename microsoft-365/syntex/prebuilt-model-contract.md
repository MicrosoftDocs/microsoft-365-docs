# Use a prebuilt model to extract information from contracts in Microsoft Syntex

The prebuilt *contracts model* analyzes and extracts key information from contract documents. The model recognizes contracts in various formats and extracts key contract information, such as client name and address, contract duration, and renewal date.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this model is available only for .pdf and image file types. More file types will be added in future releases.

To use a contracts model, follow these steps:

- Step 1: [Create a contracts model](#step-1-create-a-contracts-model)
- Step 2: [Upload an example file to analyze](#step-2-upload-an-example-file-to-analyze)
- Step 3: [Select extractors for your model](#step-3-select-extractors-for-your-model)
- Step 4: [Apply the model](#step-4-apply-the-model)

## Step 1: Create a contracts model

Follow the instructions in [Create a model in Syntex](create-syntex-model.md#set-up-a-prebuilt-model) to create a prebuilt contracts model. Then continue with the following steps to complete your model.

## Step 2: Upload an example file to analyze

1. On the **Models** page, in the **Add a file to analyze** section, select **Add a file**.

2. On the **Files to analyze the model** page, select **Add** to find the file you want to use.

3. On the **Add a file from the training files library** page, select the file, and then select **Add**.

    ![Screenshot of the Add a file from the training files library page.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-add-file-from-training-library.png) 

4. On the **Files to analyze the model** page, select **Next**.

## Step 3: Select extractors for your model

On the extractor details page, you'll see the document area on the right and the **Extractors** panel on the left. The **Extractors** panel shows the list of extractors that have been identified in the document.

   ![Screenshot of the extractor details page and Extractors panel.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-extractor-details-page-contracts.png) 

The entity fields that are highlighted in green in the document area are the items that were detected by the model when it analyzed the file. When you select an entity to extract, the highlighted field will change to blue. If you later decide not to include the entity, the highlighted field will change to gray. The highlights make it easier to see the current state of the extractors you've selected.

The prebuilt contracts model lets you have multiple values for a given field. For example, if a contract involves two or more parties, it could apply to multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the parties and jurisdictions are themselves objects with multiple properties. 

> [!TIP]
> You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse or the controls at the bottom of the document area to zoom in or out as needed to read the entity fields.

### Select an extractor entity

You can select an extractor either from the document area or from the **Extractors** panel, depending on your preference.
 
- To select an extractor from the document area, select the entity field.

    ![Screenshot of the document area showing how to select an entity field.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-document-area-select-field-contracts.png) 

- To select an extractor from the **Extractors** panel, select the checkbox to the right of the entity name.

    ![Screenshot of the Extractors panel showing how to select an entity field.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-extractors-panel-select-field-contracts.png) 

When you select an extractor, a **Select extractor?** box is displayed in the document area. The box shows the extractor name, the original value, and the option to select it as an extractor. For certain data types such as numbers or dates, it will also show an extracted value.

   ![Screenshot of the Select extractor box on the extractor details page.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-select-distractor-box-contracts.png) 

The original value is what is actually in the document. The extracted value is what will be written into the column in SharePoint. When the model is applied to a library, you can use column formatting to specify how you want it to look in the document.

Continue to select additional extractors you want to you use. You can also add other files to analyze for this model configuration.

### Rename an extractor

You can rename an extractor either from the model home page or from the **Extractors** panel. You might consider renaming selected extractors because these names will be used as the column names when the model is applied to the library.

To rename an extractor from the model home page:

1. In the **Extractors** section, select the extractor you want to rename, and then select **Rename**.

    ![Screenshot of the Extractors section with the Rename option highlighted.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-model-page-rename-extractor.png) 

2. On the **Rename entity extractor** panel, enter the new name of the extractor, and then select **Rename**.

To rename an extractor from the **Extractors** panel:

1. Select the extractor you want to rename, and then select **Rename**.

2. In the **Rename extractor** box, enter the new name of the extractor, and then select **Rename**.

## Step 4: Apply the model

- To save changes and return to the model home page, on the **Extractors** panel, select **Save and exit**.

- If you're ready to apply the model to a library, in the document area, select **Next**. On the **Add to library** panel, choose the library to which you want to add the model, and then select **Add**.
