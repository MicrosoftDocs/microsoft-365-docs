# Set up and manage document translation in Microsoft Syntex

The document translation service for Microsoft Syntex is set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use translation in Syntex, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). Translation in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up translation in Syntex.  

## Set up translation

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), translation is automatically set up and turned on for all SharePoint sites.

## Manage sites

By default, document translation is turned on for libraries in all SharePoint sites. Follow these steps to limit which sites users can use document translation.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>, and then select **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex**.

2. On the **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Manage Microsoft Syntex**.

3. On the **Microsoft Syntex** panel, select **Document translation**.

4. On the **Document translation** panel:

    a. Choose which site or sites this service should be enabled for.

    b. To restrict user access to this service, under **Sites where document translation can be used when it's turned on**, select **Edit**. On the **Where can document translation be used?** panel, select **No sites** or **Selected sites (up to 100)** and follow the instructions to either select the sites or upload a CSV listing a maximum of 100 sites. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected.

    c. Select **Save**.

## Video transcript translation
