## Step 1: Set up pay-as-you-go billing

Microsoft 365 Backup is a pay-as-you-go offering that charges based on consumption, unlike traditional seat-based licenses. To set up pay-as-you-go for Microsoft 365 Backup, you will need to have this information:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Valid Azure subscription**. An Azure subscription provides a logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with only one subscription. Creating a subscription is the first step in adopting Azure. To learn more about Azure, see [Azure fundamental concepts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/fundamental-concepts).
> * **Resource group**. A resource group provides a logical grouping of resources within an Azure subscription.
> * **Region**. The region in which you want to register the service.
> * **Owner or contributor**. Name of an owner or contributor role on the Azure subscription.

Once you have the information on this list, you are ready to [set up pay-as-you-go billing for Microsoft 365 Backup](backup-billing.md).

<!---To set up pay-as-you-go billing, follow the steps in [Configure Microsoft Syntex for pay-as-you-go billing](../syntex-azure-billing.md).--->

### Set up backup policies for OneDrive, SharePoint, and Exchange

To use Microsoft 365 Backup for OneDrive, SharePoint, or Exchange, you need to create a backup policy for each product. A *policy* represents the backup plan defined by admins for protecting the Microsoft 365 data of an organization.

A policy contains details of what data (OneDrive accounts, SharePoint sites, and Exchange mailboxes) to protect. Although you see the retention period and backup frequency (which defines the restore point objective), those settings aren't currently variable or modifiable.

Select the **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, or **Exchange** tab for steps to create a backup policy for that product.

# [OneDrive](#tab/onedrive)

Follow these steps to set up a backup policy for OneDrive accounts using Microsoft 365 Backup.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

4. On the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **OneDrive** section, select **Set up policy**.

## Admin roles and backup management privileges

Only tenant-level admins can create and manage backups using Microsoft 365 Backup for their users. End users don't have the ability to enable backup or restores for their user account, distribution lists, mailboxes, or sites. Itâ€™s important to note that your admin role determines which products you can manage with Microsoft 365 Backup. In the future, we might introduce a Backup admin role that can control the entire tool.

|Admin role  |OneDrive  |SharePoint  |Exchange  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Global admin     | âœ“        | âœ“        | âœ“       |
|SharePoint admin     | âœ“        | âœ“        |         |
|Exchange admin    |         |         | âœ“        |

## Glossary

- **Protection units** â€“ SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, or Exchange Online mailboxes backed up by the Microsoft 365 Backup tool.

- **Restore point** â€“ A prior point in time from which you can restore a version of your content and metadata. If the protection unit from a prior point in time is identical to the present state of your data, then a restore from that point will have no impact on your current data.

- **RPO** â€“ Recovery point objective, or how close in time the most recent restore point is to an impacting event.

- **RTO** â€“ Recovery time objective, or how fast a restore to a prior point in time can complete.
