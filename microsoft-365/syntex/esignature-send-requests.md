# Create a signature request using SharePoint eSignature

## Create a signature request

Use the following steps to start the SharePoint eSignature process.

1. From a SharePoint document library, open the document for which you want to start the eSignature process.

2. In the document viewer, select **More options** (...), and then select **Get signatures**.

3. On the **SharePoint eSignature** panel, add up to 10 internal or external recipients you want to sign the document, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Specify where to sign** panel, drag and drop the **Signature**, **Initials**, and **Date** fields to the appropriate locations in the document for each recipient. Each form field can be marked either as required or not required.

5. Select **Next** to progress to the next stage. At least one required signature field is needed for each recipient. Up to 50 fields (total) can be added to the document.

6. On the **Review request** panel, enter a title for the request, add an optional message, and review the details on the panel to make sure it's correct. Then select **Send**.

    Once sent, the status of the request is set to **In progress** and recipients are able to add their signatures. An email notification is sent to the creator and the recipients.

## Cancel a signature request

If you create a signature request and want to cancel it, follow these steps.

1. From one of your email notifications, select **View Request**.

2. When the document is open in the document viewer, select **More options** (...), and then select **Cancel request**.

3. On the **Cancel signature request** confirmation screen, enter a message detailing why the request is canceled if needed, and then select **Yes, cancel**.

    Once canceled, the status of the request is set to **Canceled** and recipients receive an email notification telling them that the request was canceled and that no further action is possible on this request.
