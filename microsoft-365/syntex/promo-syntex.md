# Try out Microsoft Syntex and explore its services

Microsoft Syntex (evolving to be SharePoint Premium) is a powerful tool that lets you do more with your documents. You can process, analyze, create, sign, manage, and enhance them with ease.

Through June 2024, your organization can use included monthly capacity for some of these services when you set up [pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md). It's a great way to try out Syntex capabilities, such as document processing, document tagging, and content assembly, to see how you can use them to streamline processes in your organization.

## Get started

If you want to try some of these services, here are the steps to follow:

1. [Set up pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md).

2. [Turn on the Syntex services you want to try](set-up-microsoft-syntex.md).

3. [Start using the Syntex services](syntex-overview.md#syntex-services).

## Monthly included capacity

You'll get a limited amount of usage each month during the offering period. The following table shows the units of service and capacity limits your organization can use at no charge for each month. Capacity limits shown are per tenant, not per user.

|Service  |Units  |Monthly included capacity at no charge  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Content assembly                 | Documents    | 50         |
|Document translation             | Characters   | 1 million  |
|eSignature                       | Requests     | 5          |
|Image tagging                    | Images       | 2,500      |
|Optical character recognition    | Pages        | 2,500      |
|Prebuilt document processing     | Pages        | 100        |
|Structured document processing   | Pages        | 100        |
|Taxonomy tagging                 | Documents    | 50         |
|Unstructured document processing | Pages        | 100        |

Monthly usage over the limitations will be billed as described in [Pay-as-you-go services and pricing](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md). This offering doesn't include capacity for Microsoft 365 Archive and Microsoft 365 Backup.

This article describes how to set up and run a trial pilot program to deploy Microsoft Syntex in your organization. It also recommends best practices for the trial.

## Sign up for a trial

The trial of Syntex gives access to 300 users for 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> Up to 300 users are included in the trial to ensure the automatic addition of 1 million AI Builder credits. You do not have to include 300 users for a trial to succeed.

You can get the trial version from one of the following sources:

- The [Syntex product page](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/sharepoint-syntex?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

- The [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com)
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
    2. Go to **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">**Purchase Services**</a>.
    3. Scroll down to the **Add-Ons** section.
    4. On the Syntex tile, select **Details**.
    5. Select **Start free trial**.
    6. To confirm the trial, follow the remaining wizard steps.

You must be a Microsoft 365 global administrator or billing administrator to activate a trial.

### Who should be involved in a trial

|Role|Activity|
|---|---|
|Microsoft 365 global admin or billing admin|Activate the trial and assign licenses|
|Microsoft 365 global admin or SharePoint admin|Configure Syntex and create content centers|
|Business users|Model building and testing|

### Before you activate a trial

To successfully plan a Syntex trial, consider the following factors:

- The most meaningful testing is completed on “real world” scenarios and data.
- You can only activate a Syntex trial once per tenant.

A test or demo tenant can be used as a “dry run” to walk through the activation steps and administrative controls. But it's probably best to evaluate model building on a production tenant.

To maximize the value of a trial on a production tenant, planning and business engagement are essential. You should engage one or more business areas to identify three to six use cases that could potentially be addressed by Syntex. These use cases should:

- Include scenarios that could be solved by using either a custom model or a prebuilt model.

- Have a clear understanding of the purpose for any extracted metadata; for example, view formatting or automation by using Power Automate. While Syntex is focused on classifying documents and extracting metadata, the value to quantify is what this metadata enables.

- Be based on a defined set of data; for example, specific SharePoint sites or libraries. A common misconception of Syntex is that general purpose models can be applied across all organization content. A more accurate view is that models are built to help solve specific business problems in targeted locations.

All of these use cases might not be a good fit for Syntex. The goal of a quality trial isn't to prove that Syntex will fit all the scenarios. Instead, the trial should help you better understand the value of the product.

For each of the planned use cases, identify users who are subject matter experts in the related content or process. The creation of Syntex models is focused on domain experts in the content, rather than on IT professionals or developer resources.

## Activate a trial

When you initiate a trial, you need to:

- Assign licenses to the relevant users.
- Perform [additional setup of Syntex](set-up-content-understanding.md).
  - You might want to [create more content centers](create-a-content-center.md).

After the trial is activated, you can create models and process files. See [guidance for model creation](create-a-content-center.md).

## During a trial

Trial periods are limited, so it's best to focus initially on whether Syntex models can classify documents and extract metadata for the defined use cases. After the trial period is over, you can evaluate how the metadata can be used.

## After a trial

Based on the outcome of the trial, you can decide whether to proceed to production use of Syntex.

### Proceed to production use

To ensure continuity of service, you need to purchase the required number of [licenses](syntex-licensing.md) and assign those licenses to users. Trial users who don't have a full license at the end of the trial period won't be able to fully use Syntex.

You might have to estimate your projected use of structured document processing or freeform document processing models, and plan for the expected number of AI Builder credits. For help, see [Estimate the AI Builder capacity that's right for you](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder-calculator/).

### Don't proceed to production use

If you don't purchase licenses following the trial:

- You won't be able to create new models.

- Libraries that were running models will no longer automatically classify files or extract models.

- Any previously classified files or extracted metadata won't be affected.

- Content centers and any models in them won't be automatically deleted. These will remain available for use if you decide to purchase licenses in the future.

- Structured document processing or freeform document processing models will be stored in the Dataverse (formerly named Common Data Service (CDS)) instance of the default Power Platform environment. These could be used with future licensing for Syntex or with AI Builder capabilities in the Power Platform.
