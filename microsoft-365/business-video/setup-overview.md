## 1. Sign up for the cloud

When choosing a cloud subscription for your business, you have choices as to what features you want in your subscription. Learn about our [Microsoft small business plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business?rtc=1).

- Choose [Office 365 Business Essentials](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-365-business-essentials/cfq7ttc0k59v?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab) if you want just online apps (apps you can access in a web browser) for email, document creation, collaboration, and cloud storage. This includes Word Online, Excel Online, PowerPoint Online, and SharePoint Online.
- Choose [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business-premium) if you want the feature-rich version of Office apps like Word, Excel, and Teams that run directly on your PCs and Macs. This is in addition to the online apps.
- Choose [Microsoft 365 Business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business?rtc=1) if you want all of the Office apps, plus cloud security and device management. This includes protection against viruses, malware, ransomware, and more, as well as device management and encryption. You also get a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro from previous Windows Professional versions.
- If you have a larger business or need more complex IT apps and services, learn about our [Microsoft 365 Enterprise plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans).


## 2. Add a domain name

- A domain name provides your organization with a professional and easy to remember online identity, such as _rob@contoso.com_. If you already have one, you can bring it with you to Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 â€“ we&#39;ll help with the transition.
- Don&#39;t have a domain? It&#39;s easy to get one at the same time you sign up for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365.

**Note:**  In addition to your email, you can use the domain with a website on various hosts, like WordPress, GoDaddy, or Wix.

## 3. Add users with licenses

- For every employee or person at your company who needs to use business software and services, add them as a user in Microsoft 365. You can assign them the same license that you assign to yourself (for example Microsoft 365 Business Premium), or you can assign them different plans with more or fewer features (for example, Microsoft 365 Business Basic).
- When you create a user, you&#39;ll add their name, work email address, password, and other information. They&#39;ll use this information to sign in to the service and receive email. You can change their password, permissions, or other settings at any time.


## 4. Enable threat protection

- You&#39;ll want to turn on Advanced Threat Protection while setting up the service. Microsoft 365 Advanced Threat Protection includes configuration, protection, and detection capabilities, including Safe Attachments, Safe Links, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams protections, anti-phishing protection, and real-time threat detection.
- By default, you&#39;ll receive help with core protection against common online threats, but you can customize these settings later to fit your business needs.

## 5. Manage and secure your devices

- With Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you get protection on your devices, protection from online threats, and protection against accidental data loss. You also get Windows Defender, BitLocker, and automatic updates to Windows 10 Pro and Office apps.
- You can set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), email encryption, malware protection, and ransomware protection to prevent unauthorized access to devices and data.
- You can protect your valuable work data stored locally on your PC, in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business, or on your mobile device. Built-in Mobile Device Management (MDM) for Microsoft 365 helps you secure and manage your users&#39; mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Androids, and Windows phones. With MDM, you can create and manage device security policies, remotely wipe a device, and view detailed device reports.

## 6. Upgrade your PCs to Windows 10 Pro

- Start upgrading your PCs to Windows 10 Professional (free with Microsoft 365 Business Premium if you&#39;re running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro) so that you can benefit from all the Microsoft 365 Business Premium features, like advanced security and device management.
- You can also upgrade to Windows 10 Pro from a consumer version or if you&#39;re running Microsoft 365 Business Standard, but a one-time purchase is required.

## 7. Connect your PCs to Microsoft 365

- To get the most out of Microsoft 365, you&#39;ll want to connect your Windows 10 PCs to Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Azure Active Directory running behind it. This allows your PC to be managed by Microsoft 365 Business Premium to get software updates and protection against data loss and other cyber threats.
- When you connect your PC, Windows 10 registers your device with your organization&#39;s network, and then joins your device to the network so you can use your organization&#39;s user name and password to sign in and access resources.
- Based on your organization&#39;s requirements, you might be asked to set up two-step verification, encryption, and mobile device management such as Microsoft Intune.

## 8. Set up and use Office apps

- Start using all of the Office apps available to you, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. If it&#39;s not installed already, you can easily install it from the [Microsoft Office website](https://www.office.com/).
- One of the first things you&#39;ll do is open Outlook for the first time. You&#39;ll enter your Microsoft 365 email address and password and have immediate access to your email, calendar, and contacts.
- In addition, you can open Microsoft Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the rest of the Office apps. You may be prompted for your email address and password the first time you open each app.

## 9. Migrate old email and files

- At some point, you&#39;ll want to import your old email, calendar, and contacts, as well as business documents and other files to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.
- For email, you can do this in Outlook by exporting the old email as a PST and then importing that PST into the new email account. Then repeat this on other computers. You can also use a partner to help with this step.
- For business documents, you can drag and drop your files into OneDrive for Business and in the case of common or shared business files, copy those to SharePoint.

## 10. Set up your phones

- If you plan to use your phones to stay productive on the go, you&#39;ll want to add Office apps like Outlook, Teams, and Excel to your mobile devices, like Android and iOS.
- With Microsoft 365 Business Premium, security is enforced on each device, so when installing and opening apps, you&#39;ll be prompted to create a pin, create a second form of authentication (MFA), and other settings to help protect business data on the phone.
