> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4JD2Y?autoplay=false]

To migrate email, calendar, and contacts from Google Workspace, you need to set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium with a temporary domain until your business domain is ready to be used with your subscription.

## Try it! 

1. Sign in to [office.com](https://office.com),  and choose **Admin**.
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, choose **Go to guided setup**. 
1. Optionally, install Office apps, then select **Continue**. 
1. Since you are migrating from Google Workspace, choose the default domain, and select **Use this domain**. 
1. Enter your user’s names, and desired usernames, verify your email address so you can receive your user’s passwords,then select **Add users and assign licenses**. 
1. Enter the email addresses where your users will receive their new credentials, select **Send email and continue**.
1. Then **Continue** again to connect your temporary domain. 
1. Optionally choose to inform users in your organization about Teams, then select **Continue**.
1. Expand and review your **Android and iOS settings**, then select **Create mobile app management policy**.
1. Provide feedback, if desired, and choose **Go to admin center**.

The next step in the process will be to set up protections for your organization.
