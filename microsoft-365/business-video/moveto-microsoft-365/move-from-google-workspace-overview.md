# Switch from Google Workspace - Overview

Complete the following steps to move your data, email, and users from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 for business.


| Step  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Step 1 |  [Sign up](../sign-up.md) for Microsoft 365 Business Premium       |
|Step 2 |   [Set up Microsoft 365 for Google Workspace migration](set-up-microsoft-365-forgoogle.md). </br> In this step you will validate you own the domain you use in Google Workspace, add users, and set up basic security for devices. |
|Step 3 | [Set up security policies for Windows devices](../secure-win10-pcs.md).</br> Windows security is set up separately in the Setup page of Microsoft 365 admin center. |
|Step 4|[Add your Google Workspace domain to Microsoft 365](add-google-domain.md) </br> After you verify you own the domain you are using for email, you and all the other users can start using your old email to sign in to Microsoft 365 Business premium. |
|Step 5 | [Install Office apps and Microsoft Teams](../install-office.md).</br> All the people who have Microsoft 365 licenses should install the Office apps on their work devices.|
|Step 6 | [Migrate everyone's email and calendar items](migrate-email.md).</br> In this step you will run an Exchange Online migration to move everyone's email, calendar, and contacts from Google Workspace.  |
|Step 7 | [Connect domain to Microsoft 365](connect-domain-tom365.md). </br> After you connect the domain email will start going to Microsoft 365, and all your Microsoft 365 services will work.|
|Step 8|Use [Mover to move everyone's data](mover-migrate-files.md) from Drive to OneDrive and from shared Drives to Team sites.</br> In this step, all the data in personal and shared Drives is copied and moved to Microsoft 365.|
|Step 9| [Discontinue Google Workspace](cancel-google.md) but keep your domain. </br> If Google manages your domain, you can keep it there even after you discontinue your Google Workspace subscription. You can also choose to move it to another DNS host if you want.|
