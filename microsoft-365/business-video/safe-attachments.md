# Manage safe attachments

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWtn3I?autoplay=false]

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 , formerly called Microsoft 365 ATP, or Advanced Threat Protection, helps protect your business against files that contain malicious content in Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams.

## Try it!

1. Go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), and select **Setup**.
1. Scroll down to **Increase protection from advanced threats**. Select **View**, **Manage**, and then **ATP safe attachments**.
1. Select your safe attachments rule, and then choose the **Edit** icon.
1. Select **settings**, and then verify that Block is selected.
1. Scroll down. Choose **Enable redirect**, and enter your email address or the address of the person you want to review the blocked attachments.
1. Select **applied to**, and then select your domain name.
1. Choose any additional domains you own (such as your onmicrosoft.com domain) that you would like the rule applied to. Select **add**, and then **OK**.
1. Select **Save**.

Your ATP safe attachments rule has been updated.

Now that protection is in place, you won't be able to open a malicious file from Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, or Teams. Affected files will have red shields next to them. If someone attempts to open a blocked file, they'll receive a warning message.

After your policy has been in place for a while, visit the Reports page to see what has been scanned.
