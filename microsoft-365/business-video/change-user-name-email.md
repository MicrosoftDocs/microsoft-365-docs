Occasionally, you may need to change a user's name or email address. You can do this by changing their display name, their alias, or their email address. 

## Try it!

### Change a user's display name

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**, and then **Active users**.
1. Select the user from the list of active users.
1. Select **Manage contact information**.
1. Change the display name, and select **Save changes**.

    The new name will now be displayed in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps.

### Add an email alias

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**, and then **Active users**.
1. Select the user from the list of active users.
1. Select **Manage email aliases**.
1. Enter the new alias, verify the domain, and select **Save changes**.

### Change a username

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**, and then **Active users**.
1. Select the user from the list of active users.
1. Select **Manage username**.
1. Enter the new username, verify the domain, and select **Save changes**.

    As a result of this change, the user will need to sign in to Microsoft 365 with this new username and add the new email account to Outlook.
