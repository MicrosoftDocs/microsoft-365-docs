# Securely share files externally

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE22Yf0?autoplay=false]

In Microsoft 365 for business, it's easy to share files with people in your organization, but sometimes you will also need to share with people outside your organization. To share files securely with your customers, you can send a secure link.

## Try it!

1. At the top of the Documents library on your SharePoint site, click **New**, and then select **Folder**.
1. Give the folder a name, and then click **Create**.
1. Upload the files you want to share to the new library, or choose **New** to create new documents directly in the library.
1. Select your new folder in the Documents library, and then click the **Share** button.
1. In the **Send Link** window, click the list at the top, choose **Specific people**, select **Allow editing**, and then choose **Apply**.
1. In the **Send Link** window, enter your customer's email address, type a message, and choose **Send**.

    Your customer will receive an email with a verification code, which they'll need to send to themselves to access your folder. If they can't find the email, they should check their Spam folder.
