# What is a Microsoft 365 admin?

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1SRc0?autoplay=false]

In every Microsoft 365 Business subscription, there must be at least one admin account. The admin manages the service, user accounts, and devices. If you're the one who signed up for the subscription, then you're the global admin for your subscription. You can also become an admin if another admin makes you one.

While you always need at least one admin role for your subscription, it can be a security risk if the admin account is compromised by an outside party. We recommend that you only assign the admin role to those who really need it, and assign the user role to most people.

## Try it!

### Change a user role to an admin role

Here's how to change a user role to an administrator role:

1. While signed into Microsoft 365, select the app launcher. If you see the Admin button, then you're an admin.
1. Select **Admin** to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Users**, then **Active users**.
1. Select the person who you want to make an admin. The user's details appear in the right dialog box.
1. Choose **Manage roles**.
1. Clear the **User (no administrator access)** check box, and then select one of the admin roles. To learn more about a role, hover over the exclamation mark (!) and read the tool tip. To give the user the same role as  yours, select **Global administrator**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Create an admin account 

You can also create a dedicated admin account for an IT person or service:

1. While signed into Microsoft 365, select the app launcher.
1. Select **Admin** to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Users**, then **Active users**.
1. Select **Add a user**.
1. Enter the user's **First name** and **Last name**, **Display name**, and **Username**, and then select **Next**.
1. Choose **Create user without product license**. This adds a new user, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription. Select **Next**.
1. Open **Roles**.
1. Clear the  check box, and then select one of the admin roles. Select **Next**.
1. Review the information, and then select **Finish adding**.
1. Select **Close**.
