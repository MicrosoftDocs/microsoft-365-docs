# Add an admin

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FOfO?autoplay=false]

When you sign up for Microsoft 365 Business, you automatically become a global admin. To help manage the business, you can make other people admins as well. 

## Try it!

### Add an existing employee as an admin

1. When you sign up for Microsoft 365 Business, you automatically become a global admin. To help manage the business, you can make other people admins as well. 
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**, and then **Active users**.
1. Choose the user you want to make an admin, and then select **Manage roles**.
1. On the **Manage roles** pane, clear the user's current role check box, and select the new role that you want to assign to the user.
1. Select **Save changes**, and then close the **Admin roles updated** confirmation pane.

### Add someone outside the company as an admin

If there's an external IT person who will help manage your business, you can add them as a global admin.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**, **Active users**, and then **Add a user**.
1. On the **Set up the basics** page, enter the user's name, display name, and username.
1. Select the **Send password in email upon completion** check box to have the user's password emailed to them. Type their email address. Separate multiple addresses with semicolons. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Select location** drop-down list, choose the user's location.
1. Select the **Create user without product license** check box. You don't need to assign this user a license because they'll only be managing the Microsoft 365 services, and not using them. Select **Next**.
1. Expand the **Roles** section. Clear the check box next to the user's current role, and then choose **Global administrator**. Select **Next**.
1. Review your settings, and then select **Finish adding**.
1. Select **Close**.

Your new global admin can now help manage your Microsoft 365 services.
