### Add an item to the list

1. Select **New**.
1. Add details about the order.
1. Select **Save**.

### Share the list with partners or coworkers

1. Above the list, select **Share**.
1. Enter who you want to share with; it can be an individual or a group.
1. Choose the permissions.
1. Select **Grant access**.

### Add formatting to your list

Format a column to highlight the details in it:

1. Select the column heading, select the option you want, such as a background color or rounded corners.
1. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

### Add rules to alert coworkers about list updates

1. Above the list, select **Automate**.
1. Select **Create a rule**.
1. Choose the appropriate condition to trigger the rule you want to make.
1. Customize the rule with the specific info you need, such as the names of people to be notified when the list is updated.
1. Select **Create** to save the rule.

### Sort and group list items

You can prioritize a list of orders in a few different ways:

- To sort by deadline, select the Fulfill order by column and then select Older to Newer.
