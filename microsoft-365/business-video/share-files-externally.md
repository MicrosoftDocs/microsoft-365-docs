To share files with your customers and work on documents together, use an Anyone link in Microsoft 365.

## Try it!

1. From your SharePoint site, select the folder you want to share, choose **Share**, and then click the link settings button.
1. In the **Link Settings** window, make sure **Anyone** is selected. If this option is grayed out, it needs to be turned on in the SharePoint admin center.
1. Optionally, select the **Allow editing** check box and enter an expiration date for the link.
1. Choose **Apply**.
1. In the **Send Link** window, enter your customer's email address, type a message, and choose **Send**.
1. Your customer will receive an email with your message and a link to your files.
