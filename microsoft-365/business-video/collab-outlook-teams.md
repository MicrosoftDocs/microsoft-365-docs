# Use Outlook and Teams together

When you communicate with your employees, partners, clients, and others in your small business, use Outlook and Teams in Microsoft 365.

Hereâ€™s a summary of how you might use each in your business.

- Check your calendars, add appointments, and schedule meetings.
- Add the names, numbers, and emails of the people you work with as contacts.
