# Use Outlook and Teams together

When you communicate with your employees, partners, clients, and others in your small business, use Outlook and Teams in Microsoft 365. In Outlook, you'll find email, calendars, contacts, and tasks, while in Teams you'll find conversations, files, meetings, and quick access to Microsoft and third-party apps. Here’s a summary of how you might use each in your business.

## Microsoft Outlook

- Check messages from inside and outside the business, including new leads for your business.
- Check your calendars, add appointments, and schedule meetings.
- Add the names, numbers, and emails of the people you work with as contacts.
- Create tasks, notes, and other ways to stay on top of your short-term and long-term projects.
