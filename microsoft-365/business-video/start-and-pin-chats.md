You can chat internally with your coworkers, or chat with a guest user, such as a customer or a partner. If [guest access is turned on](/microsoftteams/set-up-guests) for your business, you can just type an email address to add a guest to a chat.

1. In  **Chats** , you can have 1:1 or group chats with people.
2. Select  **New chat**  :::image type="icon" source="../media/new-chat-icon.png" border="false":::.
3. Type the name of the person or people you want to contact.
4. Select the down arrow to add a name to your chat group.
