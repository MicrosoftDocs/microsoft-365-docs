# Where to store files

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FTHX?autoplay=false]

In Microsoft 365, you can store your work in either OneDrive for Business or on SharePoint sites. Each person in your organization has their own OneDrive for Business library to store personal work files. When you create and save files to a OneDrive folder, they sync to the cloud so you can access them from anywhereâ€”a web browser, computer, or mobile device. For shared file storage and team collaboration, use a SharePoint site. SharePoint sites also sync to the cloud for easy access from anywhere.

## Try it!

### Store or share files with OneDrive

1. On your computer, use File Explorer to open OneDrive. Or, from [Office 365](https://www.office.com/), open  **OneDrive**  from the app launcher.
2. View and upload personal files, or share documents or folders by clicking  **Share**  and then either inviting others to view the documents or sending them a link. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#os_type=onedrive_-_business).

### Collaborate with a SharePoint site

1. From [Office 365](https://www.office.com/), open  **SharePoint**  from the app launcher, and then select the Team Site.
2. Add files to the default Documents location, or create more document locations, called Libraries.

You can customize your SharePoint site by creating sub-sites for specific projects, teams, or customers. You can also add your company name, logo, and look and feel, turning the site into a business intranet. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/office/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818).
