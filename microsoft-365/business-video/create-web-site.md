# Create a website

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/4839abc6-9323-4cbf-a79d-2907235f9ebb?autoplay=false]

## Try it!

Microsoft 365 does not include a public website for your business. To set one up, consider using a web hosting company like GoDaddy, Wix, or WordPress.

1. Search for a web hosting provider where you can build your website.

     You may find it easiest to choose the website builder at the same company where your domain name is registered.
1. Design your business website, making sure to include your business logo, business purpose, text, images, and links.
1. To integrate the website with Microsoft 365, you can add your business email to the website and a link to Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or other collaboration tool.
1. Make sure to connect your website to your domain name, which you&#39;re also using for email on Microsoft 365.
