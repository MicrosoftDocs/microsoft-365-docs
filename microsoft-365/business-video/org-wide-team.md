# Create an org-wide team

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2GCG9?autoplay=false]

## Try it!

Create an org-wide team in Microsoft Teams that everyone at your company can be a part of. As you add more users to Microsoft 365, they will automatically be added to this team.

1. In Microsoft Teams, select  **Teams**, then **Create team.**
2. Choose  **Build a team from scratch**.
3. Select  **Create an Org-wide team**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a Microsoft 365 admin to view this option.

1. Give your team a name, add a description, and then select  **Create**.

Within your team are channels. The General channel is created automatically. You can add additional channels, separate conversations, and files for different departments, events, or projects.

Try any of the following:

- Use the  **Posts** tab for org-wide conversations and announcements, such as a welcome message to everyone.
- On the  **Files** tab, you can create new documents that everyone can contribute to, such as a Microsoft Word document. Or drag and drop existing documents into the  **Files** tab.
- Use the  **Wiki** tab to take quick notes. And select the plus ( **+** ) sign to add apps or files as additional tabs.
- With the tabs on the left, you can view recent activity, chat with other team members, view the teams you belong to, and your calendar. You can make voice and video calls to other team users, and view files you've recently worked on.
