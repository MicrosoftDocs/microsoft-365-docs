## Try it!

Microsoft Office apps can be found on your  **Start** menu. If you don&#39;t see them, you can install them yourself.

1. Go to office.com. You might need to sign in with your work account.
2. Select  **Install Office**  >  **Microsoft 365 apps**  >  **Run** , and then select  **Yes**.
3. The Office apps will be installed. The process may take several minutes. When it completes, select  **Close**.
4. To install Microsoft Teams, go to the office.com page, and choose  **Teams**.
5. Get the Windows app, and then select  **Run**. Teams displays a prompt when installation is complete.

The Office apps you installed now appear in your  **Start** menu.
