> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE3AY8S?autoplay=false]

To let your users reset their own passwords without having to contact you each time, you can set up self-service password reset in Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

## Try it!

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left navigation pane, select **Settings** and then **Security & privacy**.
1. Under **Let your people reset their own passwords**, select**Azure AD admin center**.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Users**, and then on the **Users - all users** page, select **Password reset**.
1. Select **All** to enable self-service password reset, and then select **Save**.

The next time a user signs in to their account, they're asked for their user ID and password. They select **Next**, and then choose whether to authenticate with their phone, email, or both. They enter the code they receive, select **Verify**, and then select **Finish**. When they're done, they can reset their own password.
