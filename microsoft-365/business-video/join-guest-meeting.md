## Try it!

1. Select **Join**, decide whether you want your camera and microphone on or off, and select **Join Now**.
1. If you're an external guest, open the e-mail you received about the meeting and select **Join Microsoft Teams Meeting**.

    If you don't want to download the app, choose **Join on the web** instead.
1. Enter your name and select **Join Now**.
1. Once everyone has arrived, you can start your meeting by sharing your desktop, a monitor, or an app like PowerPoint.
1. When the meeting is over, select **Hang up**.
