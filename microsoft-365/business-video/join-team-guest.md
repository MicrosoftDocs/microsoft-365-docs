## Try it!

If you receive a Microsoft Teams invitation to join a team, there are a couple of steps to accept the invitation.

1. Open the email invitation, and select  **Open Microsoft Teams**. If you don't see the invitation, check your junk or spam folder.
  1. If your email address has not previously been used to create a Microsoft account, you'll need to create one.

     On the  **Create account**  dialog, select  **Next** , create a password, and select  **Next**.
  1. To verify your email address, open the verification email, and copy the security code.
  1. Enter your security code in the  **Verify email**  dialog, select  **Next** , enter the CAPTCHA in the  **Enter the characters you see**  line, select  **Next** , then  **Accept**.
1. If you don't want to download the Microsoft Teams app, select  **Use the web app instead**.
1. In the Teams web app you can view or reply to posts, or create your own posts, and select  **Files**  tab to view or edit team documents.

    If you already use the Teams app in your organization joining a team as a guest is a lot simpler.

1. Just open Microsoft Teams app and choose  **Yes**  to switch to the team you are invited to.  Now you can collaborate on the project in Teams.
1. To switch back to your company's team, select it from the  **Organization**  drop-down.
