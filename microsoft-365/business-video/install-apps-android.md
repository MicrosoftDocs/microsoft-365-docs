# Install Outlook and Office apps on Android devices

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWfquk?autoplay=false]

If your Android device is managed by Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you may be prompted to set up extra security the first time you install an Office app. 

## Try it!

1. On your device, choose the Google Play Store.
2. Search for the Office app you want to install. We&#39;ll use Outlook for this example.
3. On the Outlook welcome screen, choose  **Get started**.
4. On the  **Add Account**  page, enter your Microsoft 365 email address, and then choose  **Continue**.
5. Under  **Enter your password** , type your password, and then choose  **Sign in**.
6. On the next page, choose  **Continue**  if you want to add another account. Otherwise, choose  **Skip**.
7. When prompted to add the Intune Company Portal app, choose  **Go to store**.
8. Install and open the Intune Company portal app, and then choose  **OK**  when you see the message that your organization protects data in this app.
9. If asked for a PIN, enter a 4-digit PIN that you&#39;ll use to unlock your phone, choose  **Send** , confirm your PIN, and then choose  **Send**  again.
