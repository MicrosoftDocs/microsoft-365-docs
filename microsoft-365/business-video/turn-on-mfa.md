# Turn on multi-factor authentication

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2MuO3?autoplay=false]

Multi-factor authentication means you and your employees must provide more than one way to sign in to Microsoft 365 is one of the easiest ways to secure your business.

## Try it!

1. Go to the admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com).
1. Select  **Show All**, then choose the **Azure Active Directory Admin Center**.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**, **Properties**, **Manage Security defaults**.
1. Under **Enable Security defaults**, select **Yes** and then **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> For new subscriptions Secure defaults are turned on automatically.

Next time the selected employees sign in, they'll be asked to set up the Microsoft Authenticator app on their phones for a second form of authentication.
