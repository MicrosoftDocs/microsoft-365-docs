> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FOhP?autoplay=false]

You can invite people from outside of your organization to a meeting without having to add them to Microsoft Teams. Here's how it works for your customers or partners when they [join a meeting without a Teams account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c6efc38f-4e03-4e79-b28f-e65a4c039508).

## Try it!

To schedule meetings with your employees, clients, External users and other guests, use Microsoft Teams. 

1. In Microsoft Teams, in the left navigation, choose **Meetings**.
2. Choose **Schedule a meeting**.
3. In the **New meeting box**, enter a **Title** and **Location** for the meeting.
4. Enter a **Start** and **End** time and date.
5. In the **Details** box, enter a description of the meeting and any other details you want to add, such as a meeting agenda.
6. Under **Invite people**, enter the names of employees or clients that you want to invite.
7. If you see **Tentative** or **Busy** below any names, choose one of the **Free** times provided, or click **Scheduling assistant** for more options.
8. Choose **Schedule a meeting**.
