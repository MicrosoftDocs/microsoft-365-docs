# Import email to Microsoft 365 for business 

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/40f7df36-9e24-44e5-8791-e9ed0dd8fd21?autoplay=false]

After signing up for Microsoft 365, you might still have email going to an old account; for example, if you used a Gmail or Outlook account for work. You can continue to use both the new and old accounts, or you can import the data from the old account into your new one.

## Try it!

### Step 1: Export your old email.

1. In Outlook, select **File**, **Open and Export**, and then **Import/Export**.
2. Select **Export to a file**, and then select **Next**.
3. Select **Outlook data file**, and then select **Next**.
4. Select your old email account.
5. Verify that you're including subfolders. Then select **Next**.
6. Select **Browse**, and go to an easy to remember location, such as your desktop. Select **OK**, and then **Finish**.
7. Leave the password fields blank, and then choose **OK**.

 Your old email account has been exported.

### Step 2: Import your old email into your new email account

1. In Outlook, select **File**, **Open**, **Export**, and then **Import/Export**.
2. Select **Import from another program or file** , and then select **Next**.
3. Select **Outlook data file** , and then select **Next**.
4. Select **Browse**, and go to the file you exported. Select it, and then select **Open**, and then **Next**.
5. Verify that you're including subfolders and that you're importing items into the same folder in your new email account. Choose **Finish**.
