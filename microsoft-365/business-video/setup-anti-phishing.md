# Set up anti-phishing

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWvt9r?autoplay=false]

Phishing is a malicious attack where an email looks like it was sent from a familiar source, but it attempts to collect your personal information. By default, Microsoft 365 includes some anti-phishing protection, but you can increase that protection by refining the settings. Let's take a look.

## Try it!

1. In the admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Security**, **Policies & rules**, **Threat Policies**, then **Anti-phishing**.
1. Select **Default Policy** to refine it.
1. In the **Phishing threshold & protection** section, select **Edit protection settings**.
1. Choose **Enable domains to protect** and select **Include the domains you own** and **Include custom domain**, then select **Manage custom domain(s)** to add a domain.
1. Choose **Add trusted senders and domains**. Here you can add email addresses or domains that shouldn't be classified as an impersonation.
1. Choose **Enable Mailbox intelligence** and **Enable Intelligence for impersonation protection** to enable enhanced impersonation results based on each user's individual sender map.
1. Select **Enable Spoof intelligence** to choose how you want to filter email from senders who are spoofing domains.
1. Select **Save**, then **Close**.

    Your organization now has better protection from phishing threats.
