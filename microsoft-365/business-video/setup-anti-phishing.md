# Set up anti-phishing

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWvt9r?autoplay=false]

Phishing is a malicious attack where an email looks like it was sent from a familiar source, but it attempts to collect your personal information. By default, Microsoft 365 includes some anti-phishing protection, but you can increase that protection by refining the settings. Let's take a look.

## Try it!

1. In the admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Security**, **Threat Management**, **Policy**, then **ATP Anti-phishing**.
1. Select **Default Policy** to refine it.
1. In the **Impersonation** section, select **Edit**.
1. Go to **Add domains to protect** and select the toggle to automatically include the domains you own.
1. Go to **Actions**, open the drop-down **If email is sent by an impersonated user**, and choose the action you want.

    Open the drop-down **If email is sent by an impersonated domain** and choose the action you want.
1. Select **Turn on impersonation safety tips**. Choose whether tips should be provided to users when the system detects impersonated users, domains, or unusual characters. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Mailbox intelligence** and verify that it's turned on. This allows your email to be more efficient by learning usage patterns.
1. Choose **Add trusted senders and domains**. Here you can add email addresses or domains that shouldn't be classified as an impersonation.
1. Choose **Review your settings**, make sure everything is correct, select **Save**, then **Close**.

    Your organization now has better protection from phishing threats.
