# Create a group email address

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2GCG3?autoplay=false]

When you create a group, you create a central email address and place to collaborate. You can use this to provide an email address like sales or info that everyone can see and get emails from.

## Try it!

1. In Outlook, on the  **Home** tab, choose  **New Group**.
2. In the  **Create Group**  box, enter a group name, a shorter email address like info, and a description.
3. Open the privacy dropdown and choose  **Private**.
4. Check the  **Send all group email and events to members' inboxes**  check box.
5. Under  **Add Members** , select the employees you want to receive the emails, and then choose  **Add Members**.
6. On the  **Home**  tab in Outlook, select  **Group Settings**, then **Edit Group**.
7. In the  **Edit Group**  box, select the  **Let people outside the organization email the group**  check box, and then choose  **OK**.
