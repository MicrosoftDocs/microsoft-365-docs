Data loss prevention policies help identify and protect your business's sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or medical records. 

## Try it!

1. To get started, go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), and select **Setup**.
1. Scroll down to **Set up data loss prevention**, and then select **View**, and then **Manage**.
1. To edit a policy, select it, choose **Edit policy**, then select what to change. For example, select **Locations** to change what gets scanned.
1. To enable scanning for content in Microsoft Teams, turn the toggle switch to the **On** position, and then select **Save**.
1. To edit policy settings, select **Edit**.
1. You'll need to set separate rules that apply to small and large amounts of sensitive content detected. Expand your low volume rule. Choose **Edit rule**.
1. Review your settings and adjust them as needed. For example, you can choose to **Customize the email text** and **Customize the policy tip text**. Select **Save**.
1. Repeat for the high volume rule. Select **Save**, and then **Close**.
1. To create a new policy, select **Create a policy**.
1. You can create a custom policy or start with a template. For example, to create a HIPAA policy, select the **Medical and health** template, and then select **U.S. Health Insurance Act (HIPAA)**. Select **Next**.
1. Enter a name and description for your policy. Select **Next**.
1. Choose the locations to scan. Select **Next**.
1. Choose the type of content you want protected. Select **Next**.
1. Choose what you want to happen if sensitive information is detected. Select **Next**.
1. Customize your access and override permissions. Select **Next**.
1. Choose when you want the policy to take effect. Select **Next**.
1. Review your settings, and select **Create**. After your policy takes effect, email that contains the described sensitive information will be blocked, and the sender who attempted to send that information will see a warning message.
