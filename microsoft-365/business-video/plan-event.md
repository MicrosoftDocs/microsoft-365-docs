## Try it!

Use Microsoft Planner to plan an event, like tracking a product launch.

### Work with buckets

Use buckets to sort tasks by type, such as event planning, marketing and ad collateral, and PR.

1. Select  **Add new bucket**  and type a new task category.
2. Select  **+**  to add tasks to a bucket, and type a name.
3. Select  **Add Task**.

### Work with labels

Use labels to see which tasks need your attention.

1. Type in names for your labels.
2. Select a colored box to remove or add a label to a task.

## Add a comment

Post a comment to discuss a task with the people it's assigned to.

1. Type a message in the  **Comments**  box.
2. Select  **Send**.

### Keep track of tasks

Use  **Charts**  and  **Board**  view to monitor progress for each team member and the overall project, or to sort and organize tasks.

- Select  **Charts**, then **Group by**, and finally **Due date**  to see which task is due next.
- Select  **Board**, then **Group by**, and finally **Progress**  to sort tasks by progress.

**Note:**  Tasks are organized by  **Not started**,  **In progress**, and  **Completed**  so you'll know when you're ready to launch your product.
