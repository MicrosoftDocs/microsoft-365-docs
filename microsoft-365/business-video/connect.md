## Try it!
After you set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium (formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business), you and your employees need to complete a few steps to take full advantage of its security and management features. Here&#39;s how.

First, verify that you have Windows 10 Pro installed:

1. Choose  **Start** , search for  **Control Panel** , and select it.
2. Choose  **System and Security**  >  **System** , and confirm your Windows edition.

Next, connect to Microsoft 365 Business:

1. Select  **Start** , and then select the  **Settings** icon.
2. Select  **Accounts** >  **Access work or school**  >  **Connect**.
3. Select  **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**.
4. Enter the email address for your Microsoft 365 account, and select  **Next**.
5. Enter your password, select  **Sign in** , and then verify that you are joining the correct organization.
6. Select  **Join** , and then select  **Done**.

Depending on how your company set up Microsoft 365 Business, you might see a notification to encrypt your PC. To encrypt your PC:

1. Select the  **Encryption needed**  message.
2. Select  **I don&#39;t have any other disk encryption software installed, encrypt all my disks** , and then select  **Yes**. You will see a  **Starting BitLocker**  window with a progress bar.
3. In the  **Choose how to unlock your drive at startup**  window, select **Enter a PIN (recommended)**.
4. Enter your PIN, and then enter it again to verify it. Select  **Set PIN**.
5. Choose a method to save an encryption recovery key, and then select  **Next**.
6. Choose how much of your drive to encrypt, then select  **Next**.
7. Choose an encryption mode, select  **Next** , and then select  **Continue**. Your drive will now be encrypted. You can continue to work during the encryption process.

Your PC is now protected and managed by Microsoft 365 Business.
