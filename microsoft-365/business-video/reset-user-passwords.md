# Reset passwords for your users

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FVVP?autoplay=false]

In Microsoft 365 for business, you can reset passwords for users. You can also let employees reset their own passwords. See [Set up self-service password reset](set-up-self-serve-password-reset.md) for more information.

## Try it!

1. When a user requests a new password, you'll receive a password reset request in email. To reset the password, open the app launcher and select **Admin**.
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users**,  **Active users**, and then select the key icon next to the user who requested the reset.
1. Select **Auto-generate password** to have a random password automatically created.
1. Select **Reset**.
1. Select the **Send password in email** check box.
1. You'll see your email address in the **Email the new password to the following recipients** box. Add the user's alternate email address or any address you choose.
1. Choose **Send email and close**.

    The user will receive an email with the password reset instructions.
