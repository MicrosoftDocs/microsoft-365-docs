# Install Outlook and Office apps on iOS devices

Once you&#39;ve set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you can install Office apps on your iPhone. After installing the apps, you&#39;ll be prompted to create a PIN to help secure your Office data.

## Try it!

1. On your iPhone, open the App Store.
2. Select  **Search** , type  **Outlook** in the search bar, and then choose it.
3. Choose  **Get**  >  **Install**.
4. Enter your Apple ID password, select **Sign in** >  **Open**.
5. Enter your work email address.
6. Select  **Add Account** , enter your password, and then choose  **Sign in**.
7. (Optional), Select  **Let's Do It ** to add more accounts, or select  **Maybe Later**  to skip this step.
8. Select  **OK** to restart the app so that Microsoft 365 Business  can protect your Outlook data.
9. Open Outlook again, and a confirmation message appears. Select  **OK**.
10. Create a PIN for Outlook and other Office apps, and confirm it. From now on, this PIN will be used to secure all Office app data.
11. Select  **Turn On**  to enable email notifications.
12. Select  **Allow** to enable push notifications.

You can now use Outlook on your iPhone to check your email, calendar, and contacts.
