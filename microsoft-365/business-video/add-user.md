# Add a new user

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FOfN?autoplay=false]

When a new person joins your company, you need to add them to your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription as a new user.

## Try it!

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **User management**, and select Add user.
1. Enter the new user's **First name** and **Last name**. The **Display name** is filled in automatically, but you can change it.
1. Enter a **Username**. This will be the new user's email address. If you have more than one domain, select the correct domain from the drop-down list.
1. To have a password created automatically, select **Auto-generate password**.
1. To require the user to change their password, select the **Require this user to change their password when they first sign in** check box.
1. If you'd like the account details sent in email, select the **Send password in email upon completion** check box. Your email name will be added automatically, but you can add the new user's alternate email address so that they also receive the account details. Select **Next**.
1. Select your location from the drop-down list, and then select the check box next to the subscription you want the user to use. Select **Nex**t.
1. If you want the user to be an administrator, expand **Role**s, clear the **User (no administrator access)** check box, and select an admin role from the list. For more information about admin roles and how to set them up, see [What is an admin](what-is-admin.md)?
1. Under **Profile info**, enter details about the user's job, department, office, and so on. (You or the new user can always add this information later.) Select **Next**.
1. Review the user details. If you need to purchase an additional license for this user, you will see a notification on the review page. Select **Finish adding**, and then select **Close**.
1. Verify that the user has been created successfully: in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left navigation pane, select**Users**, then **Active users**. The new user should be listed, along with their assigned license.
