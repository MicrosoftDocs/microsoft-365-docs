# Use a promo code to reduce the price of a new Microsoft 365 for business subscription

When you buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription, you can use a promotional code (promo code) to reduce the price. This article explains how to apply a promo code to a new subscription, describes the [Promo code terms](#promo-code-terms), and provides  [troubleshooting help for promo codes](#troubleshooting-promo-codes).
  
## Apply a promo code to your subscription

1. Begin your purchase by either buying a new subscription or adding services to an existing subscription.
2. When you check out, select **Have a promo or discount code?**, then enter your promo code in the box.
3. Select **Apply promo code**. You should see a confirmation that the promo code was successfully applied. If you see a different message, see [Troubleshooting promo codes](#troubleshooting-promo-codes).
4. Continue checking out. The order confirmation page displays your discount code included with the order amount.

At any time after you complete your purchase, the discount created by your promo code appears on your invoice. To learn more, see [View your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center](billing-and-payments/view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).
  
## Promo code terms

The following guidelines apply to promo codes for Microsoft 365 for business subscriptions.
  
- **Number of promo codes per subscription**&mdash;You can use a promo code for multiple subscriptions in the same order, but you can't use multiple promo codes for the same subscription.
- **Length of discount**&mdash;After the promo code is applied to your order, the discount lasts for the length of your subscription term. If your subscription term is month-to-month, the discount lasts until the end of the billing month in which you entered it. If your subscription term is yearly (even if you pay monthly), the discount lasts until the end of the billing year in which you entered it.
- **Promo code license limits**&mdash;Some promo codes have a maximum level. Only licenses up to that maximum are discounted. To confirm whether your promo code has license limitations, look at its Terms and Conditions.
- **Promo code end dates**&mdash;The promo code end date is the last day a promo code for that campaign can be redeemed. After you complete your purchase, the discounted price for your subscription applies for the entire term of the order.

## Troubleshooting promo codes

If you receive an error message after you enter your promo code, there can be many reasons why that occurred. The following list describes the most common causes of promo code error messages.
  
- **You made a typo when you entered the code.** Pay close attention to any dashes, capital or lowercase letters, or special symbols in the promo code. You must enter the promo code exactly as it appears.
- **You're trying to apply the promo code to a subscription that isn't new.** Promo codes are intended for new subscriptions. If you're trying to use one for a subscription that's already active, you don't see the option to apply a promo code. There's no way to apply a promo code after the purchase is complete.
- **The promo code has expired.** Promotional campaigns are set up for a limited time. Therefore, promo codes have an expiration date. If the promo code you're trying to use exceeds the expiration date, it's no longer usable. There's no way to accept or replace expired promotion codes, but you can still buy a subscription without one.
- **The promo code you're using is for the wrong geographical region.** Some promo codes are only valid for a particular country/region. Promo codes don't work in a country/region other than the one for which they were created.
