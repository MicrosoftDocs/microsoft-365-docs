# Buy and manage add-ons in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Many Microsoft business plans have add-ons that you can buy for your subscriptions. Add-ons provide more features to enhance your subscription's capabilities. You buy and manage add-ons in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

This article only applies to customers with a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA) billing account type. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you can buy add-ons the same as any other product on the **Products and services** page. To learn how to do this, see [Buy a different subscription](try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md#buy-a-different-subscription).  [Find out what type of billing account you have.](manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

## Before you begin

You must be at least a Billing Administrator to do the steps described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing Administrator.

## Types of add-ons

There are two types of add-ons:

1. **Traditional add-ons** are linked to a specific subscription. If you cancel the subscription, the associated add-on is also canceled.
2. **Standalone add-on subscriptions** appear as a separate subscription on the **Your products** page and have their own expiration date. Unlike traditional add-ons, standalone add-on subscriptions aren't linked to a specific subscription. You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription.

## Buy an add-on

When you look for an add-on to buy, the list only includes add-ons that are available to you. This list is based on your active subscriptions, and any other add-ons that you already have. If an add-on isn't on the list, it's not available to buy.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center.</a>
    - If you’re using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**.
    - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select a subscription that you want to buy an add-on for.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Add-ons** section, select **Find more add-ons in Purchase services**.
4. Find the add-on that you want to buy, then select **Details**.
5. If the add-on must be connected with one of your subscriptions, select a subscription from the drop-down list, then select **Connect to subscription**, and go to step 7.
6. Enter the quantity that you want to buy, select a billing frequency, and then select **Buy**.
7. On the **Checkout** page, review your order. You can select a payment method or add a new one.
8. Select **Place order**.

## Manage an add-on

You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription – on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page. For example, you can [buy or remove licenses](licenses/buy-licenses.md), [manage recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md), and [edit or replace payment methods](billing-and-payments/manage-payment-methods.md) for standalone add-on subscriptions.

To manage a traditional add-on, you go to the subscription that contains it and make your changes there. Use the following steps to manage a traditional add-on.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center.</a>
    - If you’re using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**.
    - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that  contains the add-on that you want to update.
3. On the subscription details page, the **Add-ons** section lists the add-ons that you bought. Select **Manage add-ons**.
4. In the **Manage add-ons** pane, from the **Add-on** drop-down list, select the add-on that you want to change.
5. Make the changes that you want for the add-on, then select **Save**.

## Remove an add-on

To remove a standalone add-on, you [cancel the subscription](subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md), just like any other subscription, or you can [turn off Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md).

You can't remove a traditional add-on. If you want to remove a traditional add-on, [contact support](../admin/get-help-support.md).
