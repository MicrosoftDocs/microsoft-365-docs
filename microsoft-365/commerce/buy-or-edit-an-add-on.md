# Buy or manage add-ons for Microsoft 365 business plans

Many Microsoft 365 for business plans have add-ons that you can buy for your subscriptions. Add-ons provide more features to enhance your subscription experience.

There are two types of add-ons:

1. **Traditional add-ons** are linked to a specific subscription. If you cancel the subscription, the associated add-on is also canceled.
2. **Standalone add-on subscriptions** appear as a separate subscription on the **Your products** page and have their own expiration date. Unlike traditional add-ons, standalone add-on subscriptions aren't linked to a specific subscription. You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the steps described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Buy an add-on

Use the following steps to find and buy add-ons. The list only includes add-ons that are available to you. This list is based on your currently active subscriptions, and any other existing add-ons you already have. If an add-on isn't on the list, it's not available to buy.

For information about Skype for Business add-ons, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. At the bottom of the **Purchase services** page, in the **Add-ons** section, find the add-on that you want to buy, and select **Details**.
3. On the product details page, select **Next**.
4. If needed, complete any other order information. This information might include selecting the subscription the add-on is for. When you're finished, select **Check out now**.
5. If needed, review the order and pricing information, then select **Next**.
6. Choose a payment method, or add a new one, then select **Place order** > **Go to Admin Home**.

## Manage an add-on

You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription – on the **Your products** page. For example, you can [buy or remove licenses](licenses/buy-licenses.md), [manage recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md), and [edit or replace payment methods](billing-and-payments/manage-payment-methods.md) for standalone add-on subscriptions.

You manage a traditional add-on by going to the subscription that contains it and making changes there. Use the following steps to manage a traditional add-on.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the subscription that contains the add-on that you want to update.
3. On the subscription details page, the **Add-ons** section lists the add-ons that you bought. Select **Manage add-ons**.
4. In the **Manage add-ons** pane, from the **Add-on** drop-down list, select the add-on that you want to change.
5. Enter a quantity change for the add-on, then select **Save**.

## Remove an add-on

To remove a standalone add-on subscription, you [cancel the subscription](subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md), just like any other subscription. Or you can [turn off Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md).

You can't remove a traditional add-on. If you want to remove a traditional add-on, contact support for help ([Get support](../admin/get-help-support.md).
