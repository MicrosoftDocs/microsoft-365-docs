# Understand end-of-sale products in the Microsoft 365 admin center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article only applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

When you buy a subscription from Microsoft, you get a bundle of products and services that are sold as an offer. Different offers can have different configurations of products and services. Sometimes we decide to stop selling a particular offer. When an offer is no longer available to buy, we call this end-of-sale (EOS). An EOS scenario can apply to entire products and services, and regions and markets. This article describes how EOS affects your subscription, and how it limits certain changes you might want to make to your subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> If you bought perpetual software, there's no EOS impact to your software because it’s a one-time purchase without the ability to renew.

## How do I know if my offer is at EOS?

We send multiple communications to let you know that a subscription you own will be marked as EOS.

If you have a subscription that is marked as EOS, you see a warning on the subscription details page in the Microsoft 365 admin center that says, "This product is no longer available to buy, so some actions below are turned off."

## How does EOS affect my existing subscriptions?

For existing subscriptions bought before the EOS date, your service isn’t affected. Subscriptions continue to renew until you change your recurring billing settings, or the subscription expires. You can continue to manage your existing subscriptions. For example, you can update assign or unassign licenses. You can also change EOS offers to other active products and services.

## How does EOS limit changes to my subscriptions?

After the EOS date is reached, and depending on how a particular subscription handles EOS, there might be limits to the tasks you can do to manage your subscription. For example, you won’t be able to do the following tasks:

- Buy more licenses for EOS offers.
- Upgrade subscriptions, convert trials for EOS offers.
- Change the subscription length for EOS offers.  

For information about specific EOS limitations that apply to your subscriptions, refer to email communications from Microsoft and the Microsoft 365 admin center.
