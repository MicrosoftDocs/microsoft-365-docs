# Cancel your Microsoft business subscription

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- If you have a billing profile, you must also be a billing account owner or billing account contributor to do the tasks in this article. [Find out if you have a billing profile](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md#view-my-billing-profiles). For more information about billing account roles, see [Understand access to billing accounts](../manage-billing-accounts.md).
- If you added your own domain name to use with your subscription, you must [remove the domain](../../admin/get-help-with-domains/remove-a-domain.md) before you cancel your subscription.
- If you have a domain subscription, to prevent any other charges for that subscription, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md).

## What's the easiest way to cancel?

The easiest way to cancel your subscription is to [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on). When you turn off recurring billing, you can continue to use your subscription until it expires at the end of the subscription term. If you want to cancel immediately, use the information and steps in this article to do that.

## How do I cancel my free trial?

You can cancel your free trial at any time to stop future charges. To cancel a free trial, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on). If you don't turn off recurring billing, after your one month free trial ends, you're charged the applicable subscription fee. If your trial subscription doesn't have a payment method associated with it, you can just let it expire at the end of the trial period, and you won't be charged.

## What if I bought my subscription through a partner?

If you bought your subscription through a Microsoft representative or a reseller partner, you have seven days to cancel for a pro-rated refund. Contact your seller or partner to help you cancel your subscription. [Learn more about partners](../manage-partners.md#what-can-a-partner-do-for-my-organization-or-school).

If your organization is in Chile, and you bought your subscription through a partner in Chile, you have 10 days to cancel for a prorated refund.

## Determine your cancellation options

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you continue, [determine if you have a billing profile](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md#view-my-billing-profiles).

### If you have a billing profile

You can only cancel and receive a prorated credit or refund if you cancel within seven days after the start or renewal of your subscription. If you cancel during this limited time window, the prorated amount is either credited towards your next invoice or returned to you in the next billing cycle.

If you need to cancel within seven days after the start or renewal of your subscription, go to [Steps to cancel your subscription](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription) later in this article.

If more than seven days have passed, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md). Turning off recurring billing prevents your subscription from renewing at the end of its term.  You keep access to your products and services for the remainder of your subscription. If you have an annual subscription and are paying monthly, you're charged each month for the remainder of your subscription term.

### If you don't have a billing profile

If you cancel after you start or renew your subscription, you receive a prorated credit or refund. The amount is either credited towards your next invoice or returned to you in the next billing cycle.

The steps to cancel your trial or paid subscription depend on the number of licenses in your subscription. The following table explains what steps you can take, based on the number of licenses in your subscription.

|If your subscription has  |You can  |
|--------------|--------------|
|25 or fewer licenses  | [Use the steps later in this article to cancel your trial or paid subscription](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription) online in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.        |
|More than 25 licenses   | Reduce the number of licenses to 25 or fewer and then [use the steps later in this article to cancel](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription).      |

If you can't reduce the number of licenses, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md). Turning off recurring billing prevents you from being charged again for your subscription, and lets you keep your access to your products and services for the remainder of your subscription.

If you're unable to cancel your subscription, [contact support](../../admin/get-help-support.md) for help.

## Steps to cancel your subscription

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple subscriptions to the same product, such as Microsoft 365 Business Premium, canceling one subscription won't impact the licenses or services that you bought inside the other subscriptions.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.

::: moniker-end

2. Find the subscription that you want to cancel. Select the three dots (more actions), then select **Cancel subscription**.

3. In the **Cancel subscription** pane, choose a reason why you're canceling. Optionally, provide any feedback.

4. Select **Save**.

Your subscription now appears in a **Disabled** state, and has reduced functionality until it's deleted. For information about what to expect when you cancel a paid Microsoft 365 for business subscription, see [What happens to my data and access when my Microsoft 365 for business subscription ends?](what-if-my-subscription-expires.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a partner who's an admin on behalf of (AOBO) a customer, and you've canceled a subscription, it can take up to 90 days for the admin center to reflect the status change.

> [!WARNING]
> If you explicitly delete a subscription, it skips the **Expired** and **Disabled** states and the SharePoint Online data and content, including OneDrive content, is deleted immediately.

## Save your data

When the cancellation becomes effective, your users lose access to their data. Before you cancel the subscription, have them save their OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online files to another location. Any customer data that you leave behind might be deleted after 30 days, and is deleted no later than 180 days after cancellation.

- To save a document library or list content (such as contacts) from a SharePoint Online environment (OneDrive for Business or team sites) to file shares or to a local computer, see [Information about manual migration of SharePoint Online content](/sharepoint/troubleshoot/migration-tool/content-manual-migration).

## Next steps

### Uninstall Microsoft 365 (optional)

If you canceled your subscription and didn't [move users to a different subscription](move-users-different-subscription.md) that includes Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 runs in reduced functionality mode. When this happens, users can only read and print documents, and Microsoft 365 apps display [Unlicensed Product notifications](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380). To avoid any confusion, have your users [uninstall Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8) from their computers.

### Close your account (optional)

If you want to completely close your account with Microsoft, see [Close your account](../close-your-account.md).
