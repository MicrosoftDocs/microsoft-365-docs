# Cancel your subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

This article only applies to canceling **Dynamics 365**, **Intune**, **Power Platform**, **Windows 365**, **Microsoft Defender for Business**, and **Microsoft 365 for business** subscriptions. If you have an **Azure** subscription, see [Cancel your Azure subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription). If you have the **Power BI service**, see [Close your account](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-closing-your-account). If you have the **Fabric trial**, see [Cancel your trial](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi#trial-expiration).

If you have **Microsoft 365 Family** or **Microsoft 365 Personal**, see [Cancel a Microsoft 365 subscription](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cancel-a-microsoft-365-subscription-46e2634c-c64b-4c65-94b9-2cc9c960e91b?OCID=M365_DocsCancel_Link). 

> [!WARNING]
> Before you cancel a subscription, make sure your users [save their data](#save-your-data).

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, or a Billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about Billing account roles and Billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be at least a Billing Administrator to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- If you added your own domain name to use with your subscription, you must [remove the domain](../../admin/get-help-with-domains/remove-a-domain.md) before you cancel your subscription.
- If you have a domain subscription and do not want it to renew, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner.

## How do I cancel my free trial?

You can cancel your free trial at any time to stop future charges. To cancel a free trial, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md). If you don't turn off recurring billing, after your one month free trial ends, you're charged the applicable subscription fee. If your trial subscription doesn't have a payment method associated with it, you can just let it expire at the end of the trial period, and you won't be charged.

## What if I bought my subscription through a partner?

If you have an MCA billing account type and bought your subscription through a Microsoft representative or a reseller partner, you have seven days to cancel and receive a pro-rated refund. Contact your seller or partner to help you cancel your subscription. [Learn more about partners](../manage-partners.md#what-can-a-partner-do-for-my-organization-or-school).

If your organization is in Chile, and you bought your subscription through a partner in Chile, you have 10 days to cancel for a prorated refund.

## Determine your cancellation option

Your cancellation option depends on the type of billing account that you have. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

### If you have an MCA billing account type

You can only cancel and receive a prorated credit or refund if you cancel within seven days after the start or renewal of your subscription. If you cancel during this limited time window, the prorated amount is either credited or returned on the monthly invoice around the beginning of the following month.

If you need to cancel within seven days after the start or renewal of your subscription, go to [Steps to cancel your subscription](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription) later in this article.

If more than seven days have passed since your subscription started or renewed, [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md). Turning off recurring billing prevents your subscription from renewing at the end of its term.  You keep access to your products and services for the remainder of your subscription. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an annual subscription and are paying monthly, you're charged each month for the remainder of your subscription term.

### If you have an MOSA billing account type

If you cancel after you start or renew your subscription, you receive a prorated credit or refund. The amount is either credited towards your next invoice or returned to you in the next billing cycle.

The steps to cancel your trial or paid subscription depend on the number of licenses in your subscription. The following table explains what steps you can take, based on the number of licenses in your subscription.

|If your subscription has  |You can  |
|--------------|--------------|
|25 or fewer licenses  | [Use the steps later in this article to cancel your trial or paid subscription](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription) online in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.        |
|More than 25 licenses   | [Reduce the number of licenses](../licenses/buy-licenses.md) to 25 or fewer and then [use the steps later in this article to cancel](#steps-to-cancel-your-subscription).      |

If you're unable to cancel your subscription, [contact support](../../admin/get-help-support.md) for help.

## Steps to cancel your subscription

You can cancel your subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, the steps to cancel your subscription depend on the type of billing account that you have. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple subscriptions for the same product or service, like Microsoft 365 Business Premium, canceling one subscription doesn't affect the licenses, products, or services that you bought for the other subscriptions.

### Cancel your subscription when you have an MCA billing account type

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a>.
2. Select the subscription that you want to cancel.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Billing settings** section, under **Subscription status**, select **Cancel subscription**.
4. If you’re within the grace period during which you can cancel your subscription, select a reason for why you’re canceling, provide optional feedback, then select **Cancel subscription**.
5. If you’re outside the grace period, you can only [turn off recurring billing](renew-your-subscription.md). In the **Canceling your subscription** pane, review the information about how canceling works for your subscription, then select **edit the recurring billing settings**.
6. In the **Edit recurring billing** pane, select **Off**, then select **Save**.
7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 to cancel all active subscriptions.

### Cancel your subscription when you have an MOSA billing account type

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.

5. Select a reason for why you’re canceling, provide optional feedback, then select **Cancel now**.
6. Repeat steps 1 through 4 to cancel all active subscriptions.

Your subscription status now shows as **Disabled**, and has reduced functionality until it's deleted. For information about what to expect when you cancel a paid Microsoft 365 for business subscription, see [What happens to my data and access when my Microsoft 365 for business subscription ends?](what-if-my-subscription-expires.md)

> [!WARNING]
> If you explicitly delete a subscription, it skips the **Expired** and **Disabled** states and the SharePoint Online data and content, including OneDrive content, is deleted immediately.

## Save your data

When the cancellation becomes effective, your users lose access to their data. Before you cancel the subscription, have users save their OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online files to another location. Any customer data that you leave behind might be deleted after 30 days, and is deleted no later than 180 days after cancellation.

- To save a document library or list content (such as contacts) from a SharePoint Online environment (OneDrive for Business or team sites) to file shares or to a local computer, see [Information about manual migration of SharePoint Online content](/sharepoint/troubleshoot/migration-tool/content-manual-migration).

## Next steps

### Uninstall Microsoft 365 (optional)

If you canceled your subscription and didn't [move users to a different subscription](move-users-different-subscription.md) that includes Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 runs in reduced functionality mode. When this happens, users can only read and print documents, and apps in Microsoft 365 display [Unlicensed Product notifications](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380). To avoid any confusion, have your users [uninstall Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8) from their computers.

### Offboard devices from Microsoft Defender for Business (optional)

If you canceled your subscription, you can offboard devices, such as computers, phones, and tablets, that were onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Business or Microsoft 365 Business Premium. For more information, see [Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business](../../security/defender-business/mdb-offboard-devices.md).

### Close your account (optional)

If you want to completely close your account with Microsoft, see [Close your account](../close-your-account.md).
