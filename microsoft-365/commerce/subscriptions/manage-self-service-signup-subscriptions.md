# Manage self-service sign-up subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center

## What are self-service sign-up subscriptions?

There are a limited number of free self-service sign-up subscriptions available for users in your organization to sign up for. A user can only sign up for and use a self-service sign-up subscription for themselves. You manage self-service sign-up subscriptions by blocking users from signing up, and by deleting free subscriptions that users signed up for. For more information about self-service sign-up and the available subscriptions, see [Using up self-service sign in your organization](../../admin/misc/self-service-sign-up.md).

## Before you begin

You must be a global or billing admin to perform the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a global admin.

## View a list of self-service sign-up subscriptions

[!INCLUDE [O365 21Vianet admin center link](../../includes/office-365-operated-by-21vianet-admin-center-link.md)]

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the filter icon, then select **Free**. A list of all self-service sign-up subscriptions is displayed.

## How are these subscriptions different from self-service purchase subscriptions?

Self-service sign-up subscriptions are free and are available for a larger list of products than self-service purchase subscriptions. When a user signs up for a self-service purchase subscription, they're responsible for paying for it. For more information, see [Self-service purchase FAQ](self-service-purchase-faq.yml).

## Block users from signing up

You use the [**Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy**](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.signins/update-mgpolicyauthorizationpolicy?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true) cmdlet with the **AllowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions** parameter to control whether users can sign up for self-service sign-up subscriptions. For more information, see [How do I control self-service settings?](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup#how-do-i-control-self-service-settings)

## Delete a self-service sign-up subscription

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you delete a self-service sign-up subscription, you block all users from accessing their data and email and delete all data and email.

[!INCLUDE [O365 21Vianet admin center link](../../includes/office-365-operated-by-21vianet-admin-center-link.md)]

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the filter icon, then select **Free**.
3. Select the self-service sign-up subscription that you want to delete.
4. On the subscription details page, in the **Subscriptions and payment settings** section, select **Delete subscription**.
5. In the **Delete subscription** pane, select the check box, then select **Delete subscription**.

## I have a self-service sign-up subscription that blocks directory deletion

The self-service sign-up products that individual users can sign up for also create a guest user for authentication in your Microsoft Entra directory. To avoid data loss, these self-service products block directory deletions until they're fully deleted from the directory. Only a Microsoft Entra admin can delete a directory. For more information, see [Delete a directory in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-delete-howto).
