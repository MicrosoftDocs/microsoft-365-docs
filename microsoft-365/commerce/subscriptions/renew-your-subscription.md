# Manage recurring billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center

If you pay for your Microsoft business subscription by using a credit or debit card, or a billing profile, recurring billing is turned on by default. When recurring billing is on, we continue to bill your subscription at the end of the subscription term period. If your subscription is active, you can turn recurring billing off or back on again in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
  
If you have a prepaid subscription for Microsoft 365 Business Standard that you bought from a retail store or Microsoft partner, you can use a new product key to renew your subscription. For more information, see [Enter your product key for Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../enter-your-product-key.md).

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a billing account owner or contributor, or a billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Understand your Microsoft business billing profile](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA), you must be a global or billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a billing account owner or global admin.

## What if I have a prepaid subscription?

If you prepaid for your subscription with a product key, your subscription expires at the end of the subscription term. You can turn on recurring billing and provide credit or debit card information so that your subscription is billed every year on the day that you subscribed. You can also choose to pay every month, or to pay for the entire year up front. Your credit or debit card isn’t charged until your initial subscription term expires.

## What happens when I turn off recurring billing?

When you turn off recurring billing for a subscription, it isn’t canceled. The subscription remains active until it expires. You can view the expiration date on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page in the admin center.  If you want to keep the subscription active, you must pay the bill manually.

To learn how to cancel a subscription immediately, see [Cancel your Microsoft business subscription](cancel-your-subscription.md).

## Change the recurring billing setting

You can only change the recurring billing setting for an active subscription. If your subscription has already expired, you must reactivate it before you can turn recurring billing on or off. For more information, see [Reactivate your subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center](reactivate-your-subscription.md).

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you’re using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**.
   - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that you want to manage.
3. On the subscription details page, select **Edit recurring billing**.
4. In the **Edit recurring billing** pane, select On or Off, then select **Save**.
