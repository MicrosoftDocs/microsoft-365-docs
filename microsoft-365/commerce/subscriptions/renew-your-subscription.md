# Renew Office 365 for business

This article applies to most paid Office 365 for business subscriptions.
  
To renew by using a product key that you bought from a retail store or Office 365 partner, see [Find and enter your product key](../misc/enter-your-product-key.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Paying by bank account isn't available in some countries or regions.
  
## Turn Recurring billing off or on

If you pay by credit card or bank account, **Recurring billing** is turned on by default. When **Recurring billing** is on, your subscription will continue to be billed each year on the day you subscribed. You can turn it off or back on again in the admin center if your subscription is active.
  
If you prepaid for your subscription with a product key, your subscription will expire at the end of subscription term. You can turn on **Recurring billing** and provide credit card or bank account information so that your subscription will continue to be billed every year on the day you subscribed. You also have the option to pay every month, or to pay for the entire year up front. Your credit card or bank account will not be charged until your initial subscription term has expired.
