# Renew Microsoft 365 for business

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of January 26, 2021, new bank accounts are no longer supported for customers in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. If you're an existing customer in one of those countries, you can continue paying for your subscription with an existing bank account, and you can add new subscriptions to it, but only as long as the bank account is in good standing.

This article applies to most paid Microsoft 365 for business subscriptions.
  
To renew by using a product key that you bought from a retail store or Microsoft partner, see [Find and enter your product key](../enter-your-product-key.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Paying by bank account isn't available in some countries or regions.
  
## Turn Recurring billing off or on

If you pay by credit card or bank account, **Recurring billing** is turned on by default. When **Recurring billing** is on, your subscription will continue to be billed each year on the day you subscribed. You can turn it off or back on again in the admin center if your subscription is active.
  
If you prepaid for your subscription with a product key, your subscription will expire at the end of subscription term. You can turn on **Recurring billing** and provide credit card or bank account information so that your subscription will continue to be billed every year on the day you subscribed. You also have the option to pay every month, or to pay for the entire year up front. Your credit card or bank account will not be charged until your initial subscription term has expired.

    > - When **Recurring billing** is turned off, the subscription isn't cancelled. If you want to keep the subscription active, you must pay the bill manually.

    > - To learn how to cancel the subscription right away, see [Cancel my subscription](cancel-your-subscription.md).

## Extend the expiration date of your prepaid subscription by using a Microsoft 365 product key

Prepaid product licenses are issued to you as a 25-character alphanumeric code, called a product key. If you buy another pre-paid subscription for a product you already own, you can use the product key to extend the expiration date of your subscription. You can also use a product key to [add more licenses to your subscription](../licenses/buy-licenses.md#add-licenses-to-a-prepaid-subscription-by-using-a-microsoft-365-product-key).
