# Back up data before switching Microsoft 365 for business plans

If a user will be switched to another subscription that has fewer data-related services or a user leaves the organization, a copy of their data that's stored in Microsoft 365 can be downloaded before they are switched to the new subscription.

If you're moving a user to a subscription that has the same or more services, you don't need to back up user data. See [Move users to a different subscription](./move-users-different-subscription.md).
  
## Save a copy of Outlook information

If users have Outlook, they can [export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file](https://support.microsoft.com/office/14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91) before their plan is switched.
  
After the switch to the new plan is finished, users can [Import email, contacts, and calendar from an Outlook .pst file](https://support.microsoft.com/office/431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac).
  
## Save files stored in OneDrive for Business

Before being switched to a different subscription, users can [download files and folders from OneDrive or SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/5c7397b7-19c7-4893-84fe-d02e8fa5df05) to a different location, such as a folder on their computer's hard drive, or a file share on the organization's network.
  
## Save Yammer information

Admins can export all messages, notes, files, topics, users, and groups to a .zip file. For more information, see [Export data from Yammer Enterprise](/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data). Developers can use the [Yammer API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842495) to do this, as well.
  
## How to save SharePoint information

If a user is switched from a subscription that has SharePoint Online to one that doesn't have it, the **SharePoint** tile will no longer appear in their Microsoft 365 menu.
  
However, as long as the new subscription is within the same organization as the one they are switched from, users will still be able to access the SharePoint team site. They can view and update notebooks, documents, tasks, and calendars by using the direct URL to the team site.
  
> [!TIP]
> We recommend that users go to the team site before their subscription is switched and save the URL as a favorite or bookmark in their browser.
  
By default, the URL of the team website is in this form:
  
```html
https://<orgDomain>/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Home.aspx
```

where  _\<orgDomain\>_ is the organization's URL.
  
For example, if the domain of the organization is contoso.onmicrosoft.com, then the direct URL to the team site would be https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Home.aspx.
  
Of course, users can also download SharePoint Online documents from the SharePoint team site to their local computer or to another location at any time.
