# Enable pay-as-you-go for your subscription

By default, when you buy a subscription that has a Microsoft Calling Plan, you're limited to the number of minutes included in the plan. After those minutes are used up, your users can't make Teams calls until the next billing period. You can turn on the pay-as-you-go option in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. When you turn on the pay-as-you-go option, your users can continue to make calls over the number of minutes included in the plan. When calls go over the number of minutes included in a plan, it's referred to as *overage*. Your next invoice shows overage charges for extra calls at the pay-as-you-go rate.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- You must have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, and you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, or a Billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner.

## Buy a pay-as-you-go product or service and enable overage

If you already have a subscription, you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to buy a new plan that has a calling plan, and then enable the overage option for it.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**, then select **Add more products**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. Search for the pay-as-you-go product that you want to buy, like **Microsoft Teams Calling Plan pay-as-you-go**, then select **Details**. Pay-as-you-go products have the **PAY-AS-YOU-GO AVAILABLE** tag.
3. On the product details page, review the available plans for the product and select one that has the **PAY-AS-YOU-GO** tag.
4. Enter the number of licenses that you want to buy, select the **Subscription length** and **Billing frequency**, then select **Buy**.
5. Review the details of your order, then select **Place order**.
6. In the confirmation pane, select **Enable overage on your calling plan**. This link takes you to the subscription details page.
7. In the **Pay-as-you-go services** section, select the product name.
8. In the **Change pay-as-you-go option** pane, select **On**, then select **Save**.

## Manage pay-as-you-go for an existing subscription

If you already have a subscription that includes a pay-as-you-go service, you can turn it on or off as needed.

1. Go to the admin center.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**, then select **Add more products**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that contains a pay-as-you-go service.
3. Under **Pay-as-you-go services**, select the product name or status.
4. In the **Change pay-as-you-go option** pane, select either **On** or **Off**, then select **Save**.

## View current overage charges

You can use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2201187" target="_blank">Cost Management</a> page in the admin center to track overage charges for your organization.
