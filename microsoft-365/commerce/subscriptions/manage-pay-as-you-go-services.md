# Enable pay-as-you-go for your subscription

By default, when you buy a subscription that has a calling plan, you're limited to the number of minutes included in the plan. After those minutes are used up, your users can't make Teams calls until the next billing period. If you choose to turn on the pay-as-you-go option, your users can continue to make calls over the number of minutes included in the plan, referred to as *overage*. Your next invoice shows overage charges for extra calls at the pay-as-you-go rate.

## Before you begin

You must be a billing account owner or billing account contributor to buy a subscription with a calling plan and enable the pay-as-you-go option. For more information, see [Understand billing accounts](../manage-billing-accounts.md).

## Buy a pay-as-you-go product in the Microsoft 365 admin center and enable overage

If you already have a subscription, you can buy a new plan that has a calling plan, and then enable the overage option for it.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. Search for the pay-as-you-go product you want to buy, such as Office 365 E5, then select **Details**. Pay-as-you-go products have the **PAY-AS-YOU-GO AVAILABLE** tag.
3. On the product details page, review the available plans for the product and select one that has the **PAY-AS-YOU-GO** tag.
4. Enter the number of licenses you want to buy, select the **Subscription length** and **Billing frequency**, then select **Buy**.
5. Review the details of your order, then select **Place order**.
6. In the confirmation pane, select **Enable overage on your calling plan**. This link takes you to the inventory detail page for your subscription.
7. In the **Pay-as-you-go services** section, select the product name. This opens the **Change pay-as-you-go option** pane.
8. In the **Change pay-as-you-go option** pane, select **On**, then select **Save**.

## Manage pay-as-you-go for an existing subscription

If you already have a subscription that includes a pay-as-you-go service, you can turn it on or off as needed.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the subscription for which you want to manage pay-as-you-go services.
3. Under **Pay-as-you-go services**, select the product name or status.
4. In the **Change pay-as-you-go option** pane, select either **On** or **Off**, then select **Save**.

## View current overage charges

You can use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2201187" target="_blank">Cost Management</a> page in the admin center to track overage charges for your organization. To learn more about cost management, see [Use Cost management in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../use-cost-mgmt.md).

## Track Teams call history for your organization

You can use the **Usage reports** page in the Microsoft Teams admin center to track Teams call history for your organization. To view the page, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams admin center</a>, select **Analytics & reports**, then select <a href="https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/analytics/reports" target="_blank">Usage reports</a>.
