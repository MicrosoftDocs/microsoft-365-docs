> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the old admin center. To view the article about the admin center (preview), see [Why can't I upgrade plans?](upgrade-to-different-plan.md#why-cant-i-upgrade-plans). The preview is available to all Microsoft 365 admins, you can opt in by selecting **Try the preview** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).

If you don't see the **Switch plans** button, your plan can't be switched automatically. In some cases, you might be able to resolve the issue so that you can use the **Switch plans** button, or you might be able to [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md), instead. Position your mouse over the info icon to view a message that explains why the **Switch plans** button is not available. Use the information in this article to resolve the issue.

## Why isn't the Switch plans button available for my subscription?

### You can't switch subscriptions now because you have more users than licenses.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

To use the **Switch plans** button to switch plans automatically, all of your users need to be assigned valid licenses. If you have assigned more licenses than you have purchased, you'll see an alert on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page that says you have a licensing conflict that needs to be resolved. [Learn how to resolve license conflicts](../../admin/manage/resolve-license-conflicts.md). After you have resolved any licensing conflicts, you should see the **Switch plans** button. If not, you can [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md), or [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).

### You can't switch subscriptions right now because this subscription isn't fully set up or the service isn't available.


::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

To see if there are provisioning or service health issues, in the admin center, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842900" target="_blank">Service health</a> page, or select **Health** \> **Service health**.

::: moniker-end

If you find that a service is not fully provisioned, or you have a service health issue, please wait a few hours for your service to become available, and try again. If you still have a problem, please [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).
  
### You can't switch plans because another plan is in the process of being switched and is pending a credit check.

Wait until the credit check has been completed before switching plans. Credit checks can take up to two working days.
  
### Currently, this subscription is not eligible to switch plans.

You can [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).
  
### I see a different message than what's listed here.

You can [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).
  
## Additional reasons the Switch plans button is unavailable

### You have a prepaid plan

If you've paid for your subscription in advance, you might be able to [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md). However, you won't receive a credit for unused time remaining on your current subscription if you switch plans before the current plan expires.
  
You can also [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
### You have a government or non-profit plan

If you have a government or non-profit plan, you can [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
### 3,000 or more licenses have been purchased and assigned for the subscription

The **Switch plans** button is unavailable for subscriptions that have 3,000 or more licenses assigned to users. However, you might be able to [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md). You can also [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
### The subscription that you want to switch from has a temporary issue

The **Switch plans** button can become temporarily unavailable because the service is in the process of switching a high volume of plans. Try again in about an hour after your first attempt.
  
### The plan that you want to switch to isn't a supported option

When you switch plans, the plans that are available for you to switch to are displayed based on the services in your current plan. You can only switch to a plan that has the same data-related services, such as Exchange Online or SharePoint Online, or to a higher version of them. This ensures that users don't lose data related to those services during the switch.
  
If your plan isn't eligible to switch plans automatically, you might be able to [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md), instead. You can also [call support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Manually switching from an Office 365 Small Business, Office 365 Small Business Premium, or Office 365 Midsize Business plan is not supported.
