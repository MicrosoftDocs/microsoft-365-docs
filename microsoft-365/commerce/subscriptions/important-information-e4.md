# Important information for Office 365 E4 customers

The Office 365 E4 plan was retired in 2015. As a Microsoft 365 global admin, you’ll receive email updates and see posts in the message center (part of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339)) with information about when you need to take action.

## Compare your options for upgrading or changing plans

You can choose to maintain the same functionality you had with E4 or take advantage of new features and functionality from Microsoft 365 and Microsoft 365 Audio Conferencing. To move to a new plan you have five options.

|  | Option 1: Upgrade to Office 365 E5 | Option 2: Upgrade to Microsoft 365 E5 | Option 3: Upgrade to Microsoft 365 E5 without Audio Conferencing | Option 4: Change to Office 365 E3 | Option 5: Change to Microsoft 365 E3 |

| **Get all of the services and functionality included in your current Office 365 E4 subscription** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Phone numbers managed in Microsoft 365** | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Phone numbers managed both on-premises and in Microsoft 365 (hybrid deployment)**<br/><br/>Reduce reliance on costly private-branch exchange (PBX) phone systems and simplify your communication infrastructure with one platform for calling, conferencing, video, and sharing. | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Option to add Calling Plans**<br/><br/>You can add licenses for a Microsoft 365 Domestic Calling Plan or a Microsoft 365 Domestic and International Calling Plan. To learn more, see [Which Calling Plan is right for you?](/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plan-landing-page). | Yes<sup>1</sup> | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

<sup>1</sup>Calling plans in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 are available in 11 countries or regions, and are available to organizations that have a billing address in one of those countries or regions. To learn more, see 
[Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization). When you upgrade to Microsoft 365 or Office 365, or if you have purchased Phone System, you have the option to add either a Domestic or Domestic and International calling plan.

<sup>2</sup>Audio Conferencing isn’t available yet in all countries or regions. If Audio Conferencing isn’t available in your country or region, we'll update you when it becomes available. At that time, Microsoft 365 and Office 365 E5 customers can immediately upgrade to an E5 subscription with Audio Conferencing, or wait until it's time to renew. To see what countries or regions support Audio Conferencing, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans) and use the drop down list to select your country or region.

## Ready to upgrade?

When it's time to renew your subscription, consider upgrading to one of these plans.

If you bought your subscription directly from Microsoft and you want to upgrade now, see [Upgrade from an Office 365 E4 subscription](upgrade-Office-365-E4.md). You won’t lose any data when you upgrade from E4 to a new plan.
