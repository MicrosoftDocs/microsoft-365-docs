# Use AllowSelfServicePurchase for the MSCommerce PowerShell module

The **MSCommerce** PowerShell module is now available on [PowerShell Gallery](https://aka.ms/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell-gallery). The module includes a **PolicyID** parameter value for **AllowSelfServicePurchase** that lets you control whether users in your organization can make self-service purchases.

You can use the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module to:

- View the default state of the **AllowSelfServicePurchase** parameter — whether it's enabled or disabled
- View a list of applicable products and whether self-service purchase is enabled or disabled
- View or modify the current setting for a specific product to either enable or disable it

## Requirements

To use the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module, you need:

- A Windows 10 device
- Administrator permission for the device
- Global or Billing Admin role for your tenant

## Install the MSCommerce PowerShell module

You install the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module on your Windows 10 device once and then import it into each PowerShell session you start. Download the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://aka.ms/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell-gallery).

To install the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module with **PowerShellGet**, run the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name MSCommerce
```

## Import MSCommerce into the PowerShell session

After you install the module on your Windows 10 device, you then import it into each PowerShell session that you start. To import it into a PowerShell session, run the following command:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name MSCommerce
```

## Connect to MSCommerce with your credentials

To connect to the PowerShell module with your credentials, run the following command.

```powershell
Connect-MSCommerce
```

This command connects the current PowerShell session to an Azure Active Directory tenant. The command prompts you for a username and password for the tenant you want to connect to. If multi-factor authentication is enabled for your credentials, you must log in using the interactive option.

## View details for AllowSelfServicePurchase

To view a description of the **AllowSelfServicePurchase** parameter value and the default status, based on your organization, run the following command:

```powershell

## View a list of self-service purchase products and their status

To view a list of all available self-service purchase products and the status of each, run the following command:

```powershell

The following table lists the available products and their **ProductId**.

|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Microsoft Automate Per User | CFQ7TTC0KP0N |
| Power Apps Per User | CFQ7TTC0KP0P |
| Power BI Pro | CFQ7TTC0L3PB |

## View or set the status for AllowSelfServicePurchase

After you view the list of products available for self-service purchase, you can view or modify the setting for a specific product.

To get the policy setting for a specific product, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-MSCommerceProductPolicy -PolicyId AllowSelfServicePurchase -ProductId CFQ7TTC0KP0N
```

To enable the policy setting for a specific product, run the following command:
