# Switch to a different Microsoft 365 for business plan

When your business changes, or you need more features, you can switch plans.  

The easiest way to switch plans is to use the **Switch plans** button in the admin center. However, using the **Switch plans** button isn't supported in all situations. In some cases, you might be able to switch plans manually.

## Use the Switch plans button

When you use the **Switch plans** button, you're led through the process of buying a new plan that you can switch your current plan to, all users are automatically assigned licenses in the new plan, and your old plan is canceled for you.

4. Select **Chat now** on the **Checkout** page if you need help.

    When you finish checkout, Microsoft 365 takes a few minutes to finalize the switch. You can start using your new subscription right away.

## The Switch plans button isn't there

If the **Switch plans** button isn't available, you can try to [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md) or [call Support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md). For more information, see [Why can't I switch plans?](why-can-t-i-switch-plans.md)
  
Here's why this can happen:
  
- You're using more than one Microsoft 365 plan. You can only use the **Switch plans** button if all users subscribe to the same plan.

- You're already using Office 365 Enterprise E5, so you already have all the functionality available in Office 365.

## I don't see the plan I want

When you use the **Switch plans** button, the plans that you can switch to are displayed based on the services in your current plan. You can only use the **Switch plans** button to switch to a plan that has the same data-related services, or to a higher version. This ensures that users don't lose data related to those services during the switch.
  
To compare plans before switching, see the [Microsoft 365 for business product comparison](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842056) page. For technical specifications, see [Microsoft 365 Service Descriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-service-descriptions-technet-library).
  
If you want to switch to a plan with fewer services, you can [switch plans manually](switch-plans-manually.md), or [Call Microsoft Support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
## Why some switches take longer

 **Credit checks when switching plans**: If you pay by invoice, or reach a certain level of cost, a credit check might be required. A credit check can take up to two business days. Users will have full access to their current plan until you switch them to the new one.
  
 **Verification of non-profit status**: It normally takes 30 days to complete the verification process for your non-profit status. If it has been more than 30 days, please contact support.
