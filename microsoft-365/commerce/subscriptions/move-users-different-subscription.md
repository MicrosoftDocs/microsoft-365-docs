# Move users to a different subscription

If you have more than one subscription, have users with a license for one subscription, but want to move them to another subscription, you can replace their existing license with a different one.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Move users to a different subscription

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

 1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850628" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.

::: moniker-end

2. Select the circles next to the names of the users that you want to replace existing licenses for.

3. At the top, select **Manage product licenses**.

4. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, select **Replace**  and select the licenses that you would like to assign to the users.

5. At the bottom, select **Save Changes** \> **Close**.

## Next steps

If you’re not going to [reassign the unused licenses to other users](../../managed-desktop/get-started/assign-licenses.md), consider [removing the licenses from your subscription](../../commerce/licenses/buy-licenses.md) so that you’re not paying for more licenses than you need.
