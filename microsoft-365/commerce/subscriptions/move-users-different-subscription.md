If you have more than one subscription, have users with a license for one subscription, but want to move them to another subscription, you can replace their existing license with a different one.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).

## Next steps

If you’re not going to [reassign the unused licenses to other users](../../managed-desktop/get-started/assign-licenses.md), consider [removing the licenses from your subscription](../../commerce/licenses/buy-licenses.md) so that you’re not paying for more licenses than you need.
