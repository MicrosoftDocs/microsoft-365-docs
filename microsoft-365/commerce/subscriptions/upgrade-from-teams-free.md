# Upgrade from Microsoft Teams Free to Microsoft 365 for business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article only applies to Microsoft Teams Free organizations in India.

## Before you begin

You must be a Microsoft Teams Free admin to upgrade a Microsoft Teams Free organization. You're automatically an admin if you created the Microsoft Teams Free organization.

## Step 1: Get your work or school account ID

To begin the process, get your underlying work or school account ID. This account ID is different from the email address that you use to access Microsoft Teams Free.

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134797" target="_blank"><https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com></a>
2. In the header, select the profile icon. Your account ID is displayed below your name, and ends with *.onmicrosoft.com*.\
    Your admin email address will look like *admin@yourfreeorgname.onmicrosoft.com*.

## Step 2: Reset your password

After you have the underlying work or school account for your Microsoft Teams Free org, you must reset the password for the account.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. When prompted to sign in, choose **Forgot my password**.
2. Complete the password reset procedure using the underlying work or school account (the one ending with *.onmicrosoft.com*).
3. Complete the verification steps. You will receive an email with a code to use to set a new password.
4. Enter the code to complete the verification process.

## Step 3: Buy your new subscription

Use the underlying work or school account that you recovered and your new admin password to buy a new Microsoft 365 for business subscription.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase Services</a>.
2. Find the Microsoft 365 for business product that you want to buy.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to choose one that includes Microsoft Teams.
3. Complete the purchase. Remember to buy enough licenses for all the users in your Microsoft Teams Free org who you want to move to Microsoft 365 for business.

## Step 4: Assign new licenses to users

Now that you have a new Microsoft 365 for business subscription, you can assign licenses to the existing users in your Microsoft Teams Free organization.

1. In the admin center, go to **Users** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">**Active users**</a>.
2. Select the users to whom you want to assign Microsoft 365 for business licenses, then select **Manage product licenses**.
3. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, select **Replace existing license assignments**.
4. In the **Replace existing products** pane, find the Microsoft 365 for business product that you bought, and switch the toggle to **On**.
5. Select **Replace**, then select **Close**.
