# About registration numbers and under-review notifications in the Microsoft 365 admin center

This article only applies to commercial customers who buy or activate business products or services directly from Microsoft.

## What is a registration number?  

A registration number, sometimes referred to as a Tax Identification Number (TIN), is a number issued by the tax authority in your country/region to identify your organization for tax purposes. We use the registration number to review the details of your account. The review lets us determine if Microsoft can provide you with products and services. For information about what registration numbers are needed for a country/region, see [Tax Identification Numbers](https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/).

For countries/regions where the registration number is mandatory, the label above the text box indicates what type of number is required. For example, in the following screenshot, the label indicates that a CNPJ (Brazilian) registration number is needed.

For countries/regions where the registration number is optional, you can choose to provide a company legal registration number. Don't enter a personal ID in this field. The following screenshot shows an example of when the registration number is optional.

To find out the format and type of registration number issued by your country/region, see [Tax Identification Numbers](https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/).

## How do I know if my account is under review?  

When you complete a purchase, you might receive a notification that your account is under review. The review process normally takes about one day to complete but can take longer.

The following screenshot shows the review notification displayed during checkout.

We send an email notification about the review to all global and billing admins on your account. In some cases, the notification is sent to users who have the Billing Account Owner or Billing Account Contributor role on the account. The notification says that a review is currently in process. A confirmation email notification is sent after the review process is complete.

## How do I check the review status of my account?

You can check the status of your account in the Microsoft 365 admin center during the review period. To check the status of your review, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2084771" target="_blank">Billing accounts</a> page and select the account that you used to complete your purchase.

The following screenshot shows the notification displayed on the billing account details page.
