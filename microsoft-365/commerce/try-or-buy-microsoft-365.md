# Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription

Microsoft 365 for business is a subscription service that lets you run
your organization in the cloud while Microsoft takes care of the IT for
you. Microsoft manages devices, protects against real-world threats, and
provides your organization with the latest in business software. You
can sign up for a free trial subscription for Microsoft 365 Business
Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, or Microsoft 365 Apps for
business and try it out for 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a credit card when you sign up for a free trial. At the end of your free trial period, your trial subscription is  automatically converted to a paid subscription. Your credit card isn't billed until the end of the trial period.

## Before you begin

You don't need an existing Microsoft account to sign up for a free
trial. For all other procedures in this article, you must be a Global or
Billing admin for your organization. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Try a free trial subscription

Are you a new customer, and you don't already have an account with
Microsoft? Use these steps to create an account and sign up for a free
trial subscription of Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365
Business Premium, or Microsoft 365 Apps for business.

1. Go to the <a href="https://www.aka.ms/office365signup" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Products site</a>.
2. Select the plan that you want to sign up for, such as **Microsoft 365 Business Standard**, scroll down the page, and select **Try free for 1 month**.
3. On the next page, follow the steps to set up your account.
4. The signup process may take several minutes to complete. After it\'s complete, you're ready to start the setup wizard for your subscription. For more information about setting up your subscription, see [Next steps](#next-steps).

## Buy a subscription from your free trial

At the end of your free trial period, your trial subscription
automatically converts to a paid subscription. The paid subscription
defaults to the plan you currently have. You can buy a different plan by
following the steps in [Buy a different subscription](#buy-a-different-subscription).

If you want to buy your subscription before your trial is over, use
these steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Your products** page, find the subscription that you want to buy.
3. In the **Licenses** section, select **Purchase subscription**.
4. Choose either a monthly or annual commitment for your subscription, then select **Checkout**.
5. On the next page, verify the subscription, and select **Checkout**.
6. On the next page, verify the **Sold to** address, the **Billed to** information, and **Items in this order**. If you need to make any changes, select **Change** next to the applicable section.
7. When you\'re finished, select **Accept agreement & place order**.

## Extend your trial

Do you need more time to try out the features of Microsoft 365 for business before buying? If your trial subscription is within 15 days of expiring and the trial hasn't been extended before then you can extend your trial for another 30 day period. You can only do this one time.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the trial subscription that you want to extend. 
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Subscriptions and payment settings** section, select **Extend end date**.
4. In the **Extend end date** pane, review the extension information, and if necessary, select a payment method. When you're finished, select **Extend trial**.

When you're ready to buy, see [Buy your trial version](#buy-a-subscription-from-your-free-trial).

## Cancel your free trial subscription

If you decide to cancel your trial subscription before the free trial
period ends, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center and [turn off Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on). The trial will automatically expire when your month ends, and your credit card won\'t be charged.

## Try a different subscription

If you already have a Microsoft 365 for business subscription, you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to try a different subscription.

When you add a subscription through the Microsoft 365 admin center, the new
subscription is associated with the same organization (domain namespace)
as your existing subscription. This association makes it easier to move users in
your organization between subscriptions, or to assign them a license for
the additional products they need.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. On the **Purchase services** page, you see the plans that are available to your organization. Choose the Microsoft 365 plan that you want to try.
3. On the next page, select **Get free trial**. The trial gives you 25 user licenses for a one-month term.
4. Choose to receive a text or a call, enter your phone number, then choose **Text me** or **Call me**.
5. Enter the verification code, then select **Start your free trial**.
6. On the **Check out** page, select **Try now**.
7. On the **order receipt** page, select **Continue**.

## Buy a different subscription

If you already have a Microsoft 365 for business subscription, you can go through the Microsoft 365 admin center to buy a different subscription for your organization.

When you buy another subscription through the admin center, the new
subscription is associated with the same organization (domain name
space) as your existing subscription. This makes it easier to move users
in your organization between subscriptions or assign them a license for
the additional subscription they need.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. On the **Purchase services** page, select the plan that you want to buy, select **Details**, then select **Buy**.
3. Enter the number of licenses that you need and choose whether to pay each month or for the whole year. Choose whether you want to automatically assign licenses to everyone who does not currently have a license. Then select **Check out now**.
4. Review the pricing information and select **Next**.
5. Provide your payment information, and then select **Place order** \> **Go to Admin Home**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must move users from your free trial subscription to the new subscription before your 90-day grace period ends after your trial subscription expires. By doing this, you keep your data, accounts, and configuration. Otherwise, that information is deleted.
