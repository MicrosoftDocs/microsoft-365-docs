# Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2224585) and our [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

Microsoft 365 for business is a subscription service that lets you run your organization in the cloud while Microsoft takes care of the IT for you. We manage your devices, protect against real-world threats, and provide your organization with the latest in business software. You can sign up for a free trial subscription for Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, or Microsoft 365 Apps for business and try it out for 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a credit or debit card when you sign up for a free trial. At the end of your free trial period, your trial subscription is automatically converted to a paid subscription. Your card isn't billed until the trial period ends.

## Need help with choosing a plan?

Choosing a plan depends on your specific business needs. The [Microsoft 365 plan chooser](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2224446) helps you select a plan. The tool makes recommendations based on your answers to questions about things like the size of your business, your field of work, the devices that you use, and what kind of features, IT support, and security that you're looking for.

## Before you begin

You don't need an existing Microsoft account to sign up for a free trial.

For all other procedures in this article, the following items are required:

- You must have a Microsoft account, and you must be a Global or Billing admin for your organization. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- [Find out what type of billing account you have](manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must also be a billing account owner or contributor to do the tasks described in this article. For more information, see [Understand billing accounts](manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Understand billing profiles](billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).

## Try a free trial subscription

To create an account and sign up for a free trial subscription of Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, or Microsoft 365 Apps for business, use the following steps.

1. Go to the <a href="https://www.aka.ms/office365signup" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Products</a> site.

The sign-up process might take several minutes to complete. After it's complete, you're ready to start the setup wizard for your subscription. For more information about setting up your subscription, see [Next steps](#next-steps).

When you start a free trial, we automatically create a billing account for you. You use your billing account to manage your account settings, invoices, payment methods, and purchases. For more information about billing accounts, see [Understand billing accounts](manage-billing-accounts.md).

## Extend your trial

Do you need more time to try out the features of Microsoft 365 for business before buying? If your trial subscription is within 15 days of expiring and hasn't been extended yet, you can extend your trial for another 30-day period. You can only do this one time.

## Cancel your free trial subscription

If you decide to cancel your trial subscription before the free trial period ends, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center and [turn off recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on). The trial automatically expires when your month ends, and your credit card isn't charged.

## Try a different subscription

If you already have a Microsoft 365 for business subscription, you can use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> to try a different subscription.

When you add a subscription through the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, the new subscription is associated with the same organization (domain namespace) as your existing subscription. This association makes it easier to move users in your organization between subscriptions, or to assign them a license for the other products they need.

## Buy a different subscription

As your users change roles, they might need features that aren't available in their current Microsoft 365 for business subscription. When this happens, you can add a new subscription that includes those features and assign licenses to the people who need them.

When you buy another subscription through the Microsoft 365 admin center, the new subscription is associated with the same organization (domain namespace) as your existing subscription. This association makes it easier to [move users in your organization between subscriptions](subscriptions/move-users-different-subscription.md), or to [assign them a license](../admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md) for another subscription they need.

If you want to move all of your users to a different subscription, see [Upgrade or change to a different Microsoft 365 for business plan](subscriptions/upgrade-to-different-plan.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must move users from your free trial subscription to the new subscription before your 90-day grace period ends after your trial subscription expires. By doing this, you keep your data, accounts, and configuration. Otherwise, that information is deleted at the end of 90 days.
