# Manage third-party app subscriptions for your organization

You can manage licenses and billing for third-party apps in the new Microsoft 365 admin center. Updated features include enhanced subscription management, improved access to billing information, and improved flexibility for managing bills. Subscription management is based on Microsoft’s updated commerce platform. This applies to software-as-a-service apps that customers purchase directly, or from a third-party provider.

You can manage licenses and billing for third-party apps in Microsoft 365 admin center with preview mode turned on. Updated features include enhanced subscription management, improved access to billing information, and improved flexibility for managing bills. Subscription management is based on Microsoft's updated commerce platform. This applies to software-as-a-service apps that customers purchase directly, or from third-party provider.

## How to get software-as-a-service apps

There are a few ways to purchase third-party apps.

- **Direct purchase** – Customers can directly purchase subscriptions from [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/), or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).
- **Partner purchase** –  Work with a partner through Partner Center to purchase subscriptions.
- **Microsoft proposal** – Respond to a proposal from Microsoft Sales that includes third-party apps.

Once customers purchase the apps and accept the Microsoft Customer Agreement, they can manage them in Microsoft 365 admin center, or Microsoft Store for Business.

App providers sell their apps either at a flat rate, or by purchasing licenses for users.

- **Flat rate** – Also called site-based pricing, apps are priced with a monthly or annual price. On the app page, license quantity is listed at Unlimited.
- **Licenses** – Apps are priced by license. Customers assign licenses to each user in their organization

## Supported regions

- Puerto Rico
- South Africa

## Activate third-party apps

Admins must activate third-party apps before assigning them to users. These apps are activated in the third-party publisher's portal.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Your products** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2125823" target="_blank">Apps</a> page.
2. Find and select the app you want to manage.
3. Under **Settings & actions**, select **Manage in publisher's portal**.

You'll be directed to the app publisher's site where you can activate the app.

## Manage third-party apps

Admins manage third-party apps in two locations: Microsoft 365 admin center, and the third-party app provider's portal.

Here's what you can do in each portal.

| Microsoft 365 admin center | App publisher portal |
| --- | --- |
| Change license quantity <br> Manage how you pay your bill <br> Manage how you pay your bill <br> Change payment method (credit card) <br> View invoice <br> Cancel app subscription | Set up app (once for each app) <br> Assign licenses to users <br> Technical support |

After the app is activated, it remains active unless it's canceled, expires, or if payment isn't kept current. These events change the app status to disabled. Once an app is disabled, it can't be reactivated. To continue using the app, buy another copy of it.

## Assign licenses

Admins need to activate third-party apps before assigning them to users. They're activated in the third-party publisher's portal. On the app page, under **Settings & actions**, select the link to assign licenses.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Your products** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2125823" target="_blank">Apps</a> page.
2. Find and select the app you want to manage.
3. Under **Settings & actions**, select the link to **Manage in publisher's portal**.

## Change license quantity

Admins can change the number of licenses owned by their organization. This only applies to apps purchased with seat-based pricing.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Your products** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2125823" target="_blank">Apps</a> page.
2. Find and select the app you want to manage.
3. Select **Change license quantity**.

## Manage payment methods

Software-as-a-service apps each have a billing profile assigned to them. Billing profiles let you customize what products are included on your invoice, and how you pay your invoices. They include:

- **Payment methods** – Credit cards or check/wire transfer
- **Contact information** –  Billing address and a contact name
- **Roles** – Roles that allow you to change the billing profile, pay bills, or use the payment method on the billing profile to make purchase.

For more information on billing profiles, see [Understand billing profiles](/microsoft-store/billing-profile).

### Change the billing profile on a software-as-a-service app subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Your products** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2125823" target="_blank">Apps</a> page.
2. Find and select the app you want to manage.
3. Next to **Billing profile**, select **Edit**.

For more information on invoices, see [Understand your bill or invoice](billing-and-payments/understand-your-invoice.md).

## Cancel a software-as-a-service app subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Your products** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2125823" target="_blank">Apps</a> page.
2. Find and select the app you want to manage.
3. Under **Settings & actions**, select **Cancel subscription**.
