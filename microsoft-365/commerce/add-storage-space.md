# Add more SharePoint storage to your subscription

If you start to run out of storage for your SharePoint sites, you can use the Office 365 Extra File Storage add-on to add more storage in 1 GB increments. You buy the add-on in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. If you don't see the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** in the list of available add-ons, it means that your plan isn't eligible to buy it. For more information, see [Is my plan eligible?](#is-my-plan-eligible-for-office-365-extra-file-storage)

> [!NOTE]
> If you bought your subscription through Volume Licensing or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), you can't buy **Office 365 Extra File Storage** directly from Microsoft. Contact your representative or partner for help.
> For information about OneDrive storage, see [Set the default storage space for OneDrive users](/onedrive/set-default-storage-space).

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have.](manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a billing account owner or contributor, or a billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Understand your Microsoft business billing profile](billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be a global or billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a billing account owner or global admin.

## View available storage

1. In the [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2185219), go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites**</a>, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

2. The upper right side of the page shows the amount of storage used across all sites, and the total storage for your subscription. If your organization has configured Multi-Geo in Microsoft 365, the bar also shows the amount of storage used across all geo locations.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The storage used doesn't include changes made within the last 24-48 hours.

After you determine how much storage you're using, you can add or remove storage space for your subscription. To find out how much it costs to add storage space, follow the steps in this article, and review the pricing information before you buy more.
  
For information about setting site collection storage limits, see [Manage site collection storage limits](/sharepoint/manage-site-collection-storage-limits).
