# Add storage space for your subscription

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

> [!NOTE]
> The admin center is changing. If your experience doesn't match the details presented here, see 
[About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview?view=o365-21vianet).

If you start to run out of storage for your SharePoint Online site collections, you can add storage to your subscription if your plan is eligible. If you don't see the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** in the list of available add-ons, it means your plan is not eligible. For more information, see [Is my plan eligible?](#is-my-plan-eligible-for-office-365-extra-file-storage)

> [!NOTE]
> If you bought your subscription through Volume Licensing or a CSP, you can't buy **Office 365 Extra File Storage** for your organization directly from Microsoft. Contact your representative or partner for help.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or SharePoint admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
