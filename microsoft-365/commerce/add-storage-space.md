# Add storage space for your subscription

If you start to run out of storage for your SharePoint Online site collections, you can add storage to your subscription if your plan is eligible. If you don't see the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** in the list of available add-ons, it means your plan is not eligible. For more information, see [Is my plan eligible?](#is-my-plan-eligible-for-office-365-extra-file-storage)

> [!NOTE]
> If you bought your subscription through Volume Licensing or a CSP, you can't buy **Office 365 Extra File Storage** for your organization directly from Microsoft. Contact your representative or partner for help.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or SharePoint admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## View available storage

1. In the SharePoint admin center, go to the <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=siteManagement&modern=true" target="_blank">Active sites</a> page, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

2. In the upper right of the page, see the amount of storage used across all sites, and the total storage for your subscription. If your organization has configured Multi-Geo in Office 365, the bar also shows the amount of storage used across all geo locations.

   ![Storage bar on the Active sites page](/sharepoint/sharepointonline/media/active-sites-storage-bar.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The storage used doesn't include changes made within the last 24-48 hours.

After you determine how much storage you're using, you can add or remove storage space for your subscription. To find out how much it will cost to add storage space, follow the steps in this article, and review the pricing information before you buy more.
  
For information about setting site collection storage limits, see [Manage site collection storage limits](/sharepoint/manage-site-collection-storage-limits).
  
## Add storage to your subscription

If you haven't yet bought extra storage for your subscription, you can do that.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
2. At the bottom of the **Purchase services** page, in the **Add-ons** section, find **Office 365 Extra File Storage**, and select **Details**.
3. On the product details page, select **Next**.
4. If needed, choose the base subscription, then enter the number of gigabytes of storage you want to add.
5. Select **Check out now**.
6. On the **How does this look?** page, verify the number of gigabytes of storage you selected, review the pricing information, and then select **Next**.
7. On the **Complete order** page, verify the total. If you need to make any changes, select **Edit order**. If the order requires a credit check, select the check box. When you're finished, select **Place order** \> **Go to Admin Home**.

## Increase or decrease storage

If you've already bought extra file storage via the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** add-on, you can use these steps to increase or decrease the extra storage space for your subscription. You can reduce the storage to as low as 1 gigabyte. To remove all of the extra storage space, [contact support](../business-video/get-help-support.md).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the subscription that contains the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** add-on.
3. On the product details page, in the **Add-ons** section, select **Manage add-ons**.
4. In the **Manage add-ons** pane, from the **Add-on** list, choose **Office 365 Extra File Storage**.
5. In the **Quantity** text box, enter the number of GBs of storage space that you want for the subscription.
6. Select **Save**.
