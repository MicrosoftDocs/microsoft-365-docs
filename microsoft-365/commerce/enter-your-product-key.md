    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to make sure that your subscription is automatically extended at the end of its term, you can add a credit card or bank account, and then [turn on Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on) for that subscription.

## Extend the expiration date or add a license to an existing subscription

To extend the expiration date or add a license to your existing Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription, use a new and unused product key for the same Microsoft 365 plan. Entering your original Microsoft 365 product key won't work because a key that has already been redeemed can't be used again. For more information, see [Extend the expiration date of your prepaid subscription by using a Microsoft 365 product key](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#extend-the-expiration-date-of-your-prepaid-subscription-by-using-a-microsoft-365-product-key) or [Add licenses to a prepaid subscription by using a Microsoft 365 product key](licenses/buy-licenses.md#add-licenses-to-a-prepaid-subscription-by-using-a-microsoft-365-product-key).
