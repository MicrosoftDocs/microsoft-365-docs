# Enter your product key for Microsoft 365 Business Standard

If you purchased Microsoft 365 Business Standard from a retail store, this article helps you activate your subscription.
  
 **Need something else?**
 **For help with Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal**, see [Using product keys with Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/12a5763a-d45c-4685-8c95-a44500213759.aspx).  
 **Volume licensing customer?** If you bought Microsoft 365 for business through a [Microsoft Open License Program](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=613298), see the article, [Enter your product key purchased from Microsoft Open](purchases-from-microsoft-open.md).
  
## Activate a new subscription

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=839911" target="_blank">https://microsoft365.com/setupbusiness</a>.

2. Enter your product key, then select **Next**.

3. Enter your name, work email address, business phone number, company name, and country or region, then select **Next**.

4. Enter a phone number to receive either a text or call to verify your identity.

5. You can get a new domain, use a domain name you already own, or add a domain later. The steps can vary, so follow the prompts, depending on which option you choose.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to make sure that your subscription is automatically extended at the end of its term, you can add a credit card or bank account, and then [turn on Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on) for that subscription.

6. When you're finished, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Admin center</a> to manage your subscription.

## Extend the expiration date or add a license to an existing subscription

To extend the expiration date or add a license to your existing Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription, use a new and unused key for the same Microsoft 365 plan. Entering your original Microsoft 365 product key won't work because a key that has already been redeemed can't be used again. See [Add licenses to or extend a subscription paid for using a product key](licenses/add-licenses-using-product-key.md).
