# Enter your product key purchased from Microsoft Open

## Activate, renew, or add licenses to a subscription purchased from Microsoft Open

If you bought Microsoft 365 from a Microsoft Open License Program, the system automatically enters the key for you when you activate, renew, or add licenses to a subscription.
  
1. After you purchase a key from a Microsoft 365 partner, check your inbox for an email from Microsoft containing an activation link.

    > [!TIP]
    >  The email is sent to the person listed as the online administrator in the volume licensing agreement. If you're not sure who is designated as the online administrator, ask your Microsoft 365 partner. 
  
2. Follow the link in the email to sign in with your work or school account, accept the Open License Agreement, and renew the subscription. For a step-by-step walkthrough, download the PDF guide, [Activate Online Services: Microsoft 365 Subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618100), which covers how to activate a new subscription, renew an existing subscription, or add licenses to an existing subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Volume licensing customers can also choose to activate subscriptions in the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=282016). To learn how, download the PDF guide, [Activate Online Services in the Volume Licensing Service Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618096).
