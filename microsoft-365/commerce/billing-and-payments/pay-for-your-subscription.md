# Payment options for Microsoft business subscriptions

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Microsoft accepts credit cards and debit cards as payment methods for the business products and services that you buy from us. In some cases, you can use a wire transfer to pay your invoice. How these payment methods are applied depends on the type of billing account that you have with us. For example, if you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account, you pay your bill with a billing profile that’s backed with a credit card, debit card, or wire transfer. If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you pay your bill directly with a credit card or debit card.

You can manage payment methods whenever you need to. To learn how to add, change, or replace a payment method, see [Manage payment methods for Microsoft business accounts](manage-payment-methods.md).

**Just want to find out where to send your invoice payment?** If you currently pay your invoice by wire transfer, see [Where do I send my wire transfer payment?](#where-do-i-send-my-wire-transfer-payment)

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, a Billing profile owner or contributor, or an Invoice manager to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be a Global or Billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner or Global admin.

## Paying with a credit card or debit card

If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can pay for your subscription with a credit card or debit card. By default, [recurring billing](../subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md) is automatically turned on for all paid subscriptions. Each billing period, we automatically charge the payment method on file to pay for your subscription. We continue to charge that payment method until the subscription expires or is canceled. If recurring billing is turned off for a subscription, we continue to charge the payment method on file until the end of the subscription term.

## Paying by wire transfer

If you're a new customer, paying by wire transfer isn't available as a payment method.

If you're an existing customer, and you meet the eligibility requirements, you can contact support to help you change a current subscription to be paid by wire transfer. If you want to buy a new subscription, and you meet the eligibility requirements, you might be approved to change your payment method to pay by wire transfer. Contact support to find out if you can pay by wire transfer, and to help you buy a new subscription using the pay by wire transfer option.

**Eligibility requirements.** To be eligible to pay by wire transfer, you must:

- Be an established customer for at least six months and have no outstanding balances
- Have a subscription cost that exceeds a certain amount (this amount varies by service location)
- Pass a credit check

If a credit check is required, you're notified when you buy your subscription. If you agree to be contacted, you get an email that includes more information about applying for credit approval. Credit checks are usually completed within two business days.

If your subscription or billing profile is paid by wire transfer, at the end of each billing period, you get an email when your billing statement is ready to view. This email doesn't contain a copy of your billing statement. However, you can choose to [receive your organization's invoices as email attachments](manage-billing-notifications.md#receive-your-organizations-invoices-as-email-attachments). Your billing statement includes details about your options for making a payment, and where to send it. If you enter a purchase order (PO) number when you buy a subscription, the number appears on your billing statement. For information about accessing billing statements, see [View your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).

If you have an MCA billing account type, and you have a billing profile that's paid by wire transfer, you can also use a credit card or debit card to make a one-time payment by using the **Pay now** button on your invoice.

## Paying with a billing profile

If you have an MCA billing account type, you can use a credit card or debit card to back the billing profile that pays for your subscriptions. We use the associated billing profile to pay for all subscriptions that use that billing profile.

By default, [recurring billing](../subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md) is automatically turned on for all paid subscriptions. If recurring billing is turned off for a subscription that is paid for by a billing profile, you can use the **Pay now** button on the invoice summary in the admin center to pay for it every billing period, regardless of what payment method is linked with the billing profile.

## Paying by Boleto Bancario in Brazil

Customers who live in Brazil and have an MOSA billing account type can pay for a subscription with a Boleto Bancario. If you select this option, the billet for payment is sent to the email provided when you bought your subscription within 10 working days after the order date. The due date is 30 days after the order date. If you don't receive your Boleto by email, check your spam folder or contact support.

If you prefer, you can pay by electronic transfer between accounts. The Agency and account number are at the bottom of your invoice. You must enter your invoice number in the Transfer identification field.

> [!NOTE]
> Paying with a Boleto Bancario isn’t available for MCA billing accounts.

## What if I have an outstanding balance?

If we're unable to charge the payment method on file, we send an email that lets you know there's a problem. The email briefly states what the problem is and includes a link where you can check the outstanding balance. We continue to retry the transaction every few days for 30 days, during which time the subscription is in a grace period. Every time a transaction fails, you receive an email alert about the failure.

If you have an MCA billing account type, and your payment method is declined, you can use the **Pay now** button on the invoice summary in the Microsoft 365 admin center to make a one-time payment.

If you have an MOSA billing account type, and you personally added the payment method that has a past due amount, you can use **Pay your balance** to make a payment. The payment method that you use to pay the overdue amount becomes the new payment method for all subscriptions that used the declined payment method. Use the following steps to pay an outstanding balance in the admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you didn't add the payment method used to pay for the subscription, you must replace the payment method with one you previously added, or with a new one.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
    - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**, then select **View invoices**.
    - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.
2. Select an invoice to view the details.
3. A warning message says which payment method was declined. Select **Pay your balance**.
4. In the **Pay your balance** pane, select **Next**.
5. Choose whether to try again with the same payment method, use another payment method, or add a new payment method. Select **Next**.
6. Follow the prompts for the option you selected in the previous step, then select **Review and pay balance**.
7. After you've updated the payment method information, select **Save**.

## Where do I send my wire transfer payment?

[Check your invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md) for payment instructions for your country/region. If you're not sure how much you owe, you can check your bill and billing history in the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the **Bills & payments** page, on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Invoices</a> tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If you must pay the membership fee for the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) program (Action Pack subscription, Silver or Gold competencies), see [Pay the Solutions partner designation fee](/partner-center/mpn-pay-fee-silver-gold-competency) for information about how to make an MPN payment.

## Wire transfer payment processing time

Payments made by wire transfer have processing times that vary, depending on the type of transfer:

- Domestic - Four business days. Two days to arrive, plus two days to post.
- International - Seven business days. Five days to arrive, plus two days to post.

## Can I pay my invoice online?

If you have an MCA billing account type, and [recurring billing](../subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md) is turned off for your subscription, you can use a credit card or debit card to pay your invoice online. To make a payment, use the **Pay now** button on your invoice in the admin center. To find your invoice, see [View your invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).

If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can't pay your invoice online. You must pay by wire transfer.

## Can I change from paying by wire transfer to using a different payment method?

If you have an MCA billing account type, and your billing profile is backed by wire transfer payments, you can't change the payment method. You can use the **Pay now** button on your online invoice to make a one-time payment with a credit card or debit card.

If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can't automatically change from paying by wire transfer to paying with a different payment method. Instead, you must [buy a different subscription](../try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md#buy-a-different-subscription) paid for with a credit card or debit card, [move all users to the new subscription](../subscriptions/move-users-different-subscription.md), and then [cancel the old subscription](../subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md).

## Directives from the Reserve Bank of India

Currently, some credit card transactions, especially transactions exceeding 5,000 INR, are blocked due to a directive by the Reserve Bank of India. This might affect automatic payments, which means that you might have to make payments manually in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This directive doesn't affect usage charges.

[Learn more about the Reserve Bank of India directive for recurring payments](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11668&Mode=0).

As of September 30, 2022, Microsoft and other online merchants no longer store credit card information. Microsoft has removed all stored card details from the admin center. To avoid service interruption, you must add and verify a payment method for all subscriptions.

[Learn about the Reserve Bank of India directive for card storage](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12211).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the removal of credit card information, when you view your list of payment methods, the **Expiration Date** and **Status** columns only say "Unknown."

### UPI and NetBanking payment options

The admin center supports two alternate payment options for customers in India:

- UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment is a real-time payment method.
- NetBanking (Internet Banking) provides customers with access to banking services on an online platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UPI and NetBanking are only supported for one-time transactions for existing customers only.

#### How do I make a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

1. If you're a returning customer, when you make a payment, select **UPI / NetBanking** from the **Payment method** drop-down list, then select **Make payment**.
2. You're redirected to the payment partner, BillDesk, where you choose UPI or NetBanking for your payment method.
3. Follow the instructions in BillDesk to complete the transaction.

After you submit the payment, allow time for the payment to appear in the admin center.

#### How am I refunded if I made a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

Refunds are treated as a regular charge and are refunded to your bank account.
