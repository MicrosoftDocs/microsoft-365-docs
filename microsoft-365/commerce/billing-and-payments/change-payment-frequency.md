# Change your Microsoft 365 subscription billing frequency

When you buy a Microoft 365 for business subscription, you select a billing frequency. You can change how often you're billed for your subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- You must have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA) billing account type and be a billing account owner or contributor to do the task in this article.
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you can only change the billing frequency when you buy, upgrade, or renew a subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a global admin.

## Change your billing frequency

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
    - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**.
    - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing**\> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that you want to manage.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Subscription and payment settings** section, select **Edit billing frequency**.
4. In the **Edit billing frequency** pane, choose either **Pay monthly** or **Pay yearly**, then select **Change**.
