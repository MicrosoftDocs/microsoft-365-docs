# Change your Microsoft 365 subscription billing frequency

When you buy a subscription, you select a billing frequency. To change how often you are billed for a subscription, use the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a billing profile, you can only change the billing frequency when you buy or upgrade a subscription. To find out if you have a billing profile, see [View your billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md#view-your-billing-profiles).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing**\> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the subscription that you want to change.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Subscription and payment settings** section, select **Edit billing frequency**.
4. In the **Edit billing frequency** pane, choose the option for how often you want to be billed, then select **Change**.
