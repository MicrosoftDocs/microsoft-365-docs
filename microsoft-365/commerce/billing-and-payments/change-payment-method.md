# Change your payment method

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

When you buy a subscription, you choose to pay with a credit card or bank account, or to pay by invoice. You can change between paying by credit card or bank account and paying by invoice at any time during your subscription.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Paying with a bank account is not available in some countries or regions.

 **Just want to change your credit card or bank account information?** See [Manage payment methods](manage-payment-methods.md).

 **Just want to change how often you're billed?** See [Change your payment frequency](change-payment-frequency.md).
  
 **What if I have an outstanding balance?**
  
If you change from invoice to credit card or bank account, your current invoice charges aren't transferred to your credit card or bank account. Be sure to pay any outstanding invoice balance by wire transfer. In some regions, you can also pay your outstanding balance with a check. For more information about how to pay your outstanding balance, see your invoice.
  
If you change from credit card or bank account to invoice, any outstanding balance is transferred to your next invoice.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you pay by credit card, and your credit card is declined, you receive an email that lets you know that we were unable to process the payment. You can update your credit card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Settle balance** link on the **Your products** page. For more information, see [What if my credit card was declined and my payment is past due?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-my-credit-card-was-declined-and-my-payment-is-past-due)

When you buy Office 365 for business, you choose to pay by credit card or bank account, pay by invoice, or pay by using a prepaid product key. You can switch between paying by credit card or bank account and paying by invoice at any time during your subscription. If you paid using a prepaid product key, you can choose to switch over to paying by credit card or bank account, or to paying by invoice after your licensing period has ended.
  
> [!NOTE]
> After you switch payment methods, your users will continue to have the same license assignments as before.
  
 **Want to change your payment frequency?** If you want to change how frequently you pay for your subscription, either from annual to monthly or monthly to annual, you'll need to [call Microsoft support](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.
  
 **Just want to change your credit card or bank account information?** See [Manage payment methods](manage-payment-methods.md).
  
 **What if I have an outstanding balance?**
  
If you're moving from *invoice to credit card or bank account*, your existing invoice charges won't be transferred to your credit card or bank account, so be sure to pay any outstanding invoice balance by wire transfer. In some regions, you can also pay your outstanding balance by check. See your invoice for more information about paying your outstanding balance.
  
If you're moving from *credit card or bank account to invoice*, any outstanding balance will be transferred to your next invoice.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you pay by credit card, and your credit card is declined, you'll receive an email letting you know that we were unable to process the payment. You can update your credit card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Pay now** button on the **Subscriptions** page. For more information, see [What if my credit card was declined and my payment is past due?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-my-credit-card-was-declined-and-my-payment-is-past-due)

## Change from credit card or bank account to invoice

You can change to pay by invoice only if your order is above a certain quantity. If you do not meet the requirement, you see the message "Your order quantity isn't large enough to qualify for invoice with check wire."

If your order quantity is too high, a credit check might be required. If so, you see the message "Not eligible to change to invoice. Your order requires a credit check." In this case, you change to pay by invoice manually. Use the following steps to complete the manual change.

1. Go to <a href="https://Microsoft365.com" target="_blank">Microsoft365.com</a> and buy the same subscription as the one you currently have. At check-out, choose the option to pay by invoice.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You can't use the **Your products** page in the admin center to buy the subscription. You must use  <a href="https://Microsoft365.com" target="_blank">Microsoft365.com</a>.

2. After the purchase is complete, cancel the original subscription. Your users are automatically moved to the new subscription.

If no credit check is required, use the following steps to change to paying by invoice.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing**\> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.

2. If you're in **Table** view, select **Cards**.

3. Find the subscription that you want to change. Under **Billing**, next to the payment method, select **Edit**.
  
4. Next to your existing payment method, select **Change**.
  
5. From the drop-down menu, select **Invoice or wire transfer**.

6. Enter your name, address, and phone number. You can also add a PO number to display on the invoice.
  
7. When you're finished, select **Save**.

8. Verify that the selected payment method is correct, then select **Save**.

## Change from credit card or bank account to invoice

> [!NOTE]
> The option to pay by invoice is only available if your subscription costs over a certain amount (which varies by service location). A credit check might be required for larger invoice payments. To learn more, see [Pay for your subscription](pay-for-your-subscription.md).

3. In the **Change payment details** pane, select **Change your payment method**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Change your payment method** link isn't displayed, it means that switching from credit card or bank account to invoice isn't available for the subscription because the subscription doesn't meet the minimum cost amount for billing by invoice. The minimum cost amount required to be billed by invoice varies by geographic location.
  
4. In the **Change your payment method** dialog box, select **Continue**.

> [!NOTE]
> If your subscription costs under a certain amount of money (this amount varies by service location), the invoice payment method is not available as an option.

1. Call [the 21Vianet support team](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).

2. Wait while the support agent puts your subscription in a "canceled - reduced functionality" or "expired" state. Don't worry, your users will still be able to use their services during this time.

3. While on the phone with the service agent, purchase a new subscription and, during checkout, choose the payment method you want to switch to.
