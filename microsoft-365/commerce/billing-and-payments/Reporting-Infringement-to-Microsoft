# View your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

You can view your invoice for your Microsoft business subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you need help with interpreting the charges that you see on your invoice, [find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts), then see either [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MCA billing account](understand-your-invoice.md) or [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MOSA billing account](understand-your-invoice2.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the billing statement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 services doesn’t provide payment receipts. For credit or debit card payments, use the invoice and your credit or debit card billing statement to match your payment.

**Have a problem with your bill?** [Contact support for business products](../../admin/get-help-support.md).

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the steps described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  
## View your bill or invoice

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
    - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**, then select **View invoices**.
    - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.
2. Select an invoice from the list to view the details online. If you don’t see any invoices, change the date range.
3. To download the .PDF version of your invoice, select **Download PDF**.

> [!NOTE]
> The online version of your invoice looks different from the .PDF version that you download.

If you want to receive a copy of your invoice in email, see [Manage billing notifications and invoice attachments](manage-billing-notifications.md).

## Run the Unknown Charge Diagnostic

If you're a Microsoft 365 global admin and you have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA) billing account type, you can use a diagnostic tool to research unexpected charges in your invoice. The tool runs within the Microsoft 365 admin center, and lets you investigate charges from Microsoft that appear on your credit or debit card statement. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

> [!NOTE]
> The Unknown Charge Diagnostic is only available for customers who bought their products and services from Microsoft.com, including Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Education, and Non-profit.

Select the following **Run Tests: Unknown Charge** link to open the diagnostic tool in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
