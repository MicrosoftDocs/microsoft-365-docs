# Manage billing notifications and invoice attachments

The **Billing notifications** page lets you manage who receives billing notification emails for your organization. The page also provides the option to [receive your organization's invoices as email attachments](#receive-your-organizations-invoices-as-email-attachments).

## Before you begin

You must be a Global admin to do the steps described in this article. Billing admins can make some of these changes, as noted in the sections below. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Change the language you receive email in

Billing notification emails are sent in your organization’s preferred language. To change the preferred language, use the following steps.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. In the **Billing notification settings** section, select **Edit notification settings**.
3. In the **Billing notification settings** pane, under **Preferred language** select the language you want to use, then select **Save**.

## Change who receives billing notifications

Your organization's billing notifications are sent to the primary and alternate email address of every Global and Billing admin. To change which users have the Global or Billing admin role, use the following steps.

### Assign admin roles by using the Billing notifications page

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. In the **Admins receiving billing notifications** section, select the **Billing administrator** or **Global administrator** link in the description text.
3. In the right pane, on the **Assigned admins** tab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Add admins** pane, type the user’s display name or username, and then select the user from the list of suggestions.
5. Add multiple users until you’re done.
6. Select **Save**. The user is added to the list of assigned admins.

### Remove admin roles by using the Billing notifications page

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. In the **Admins receiving billing notifications** section, select the **Billing administrator** or **Global administrator** link in the description text.
3. In the right pane, on the **Assigned admins** tab, select the users to remove from the role, and then select **Remove**.
4. In the confirmation box, select **Remove**. The user is removed from the list of assigned admins.

## Change the email addresses for admins

To change the primary and alternate email address of other admins in your organization, use the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Billing admins can change their own primary and alternate email addresses, but not for other admins.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. In the **Admins receiving billing notifications** section, select a name.
3. In the right pane, add or update the primary and alternate email address as needed, then select **Save**.

## Change your organization's contact email

In addition to your Global and Billing admins, we send billing notifications to your organization's contact email address. To change the email address, use the following steps.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. Under **Organization contact receiving billing notifications**, select the organization contact.
3. In the right pane, type the email address that you want to use, then select **Save**.

## Receive your organization's invoices as email attachments

> [!NOTE]
> Billing admins can also do the steps in this section.

You can have a copy of your organization's invoice attached as a PDF file to invoice notification emails when a new invoice is ready. Use the following steps to receive invoices as attachments.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
2. Under **Billing notification settings**, select **Edit notification settings**.
3. In the **Billing notification settings** pane, under **Attach a PDF to your invoice emails**, check the checkbox, then select **Save**.

To stop receiving the invoice attachment at any time, follow the steps above and clear the **Attach a PDF to your invoice  emails** checkbox in step 3.
