# Manage billing notifications and invoice attachment settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center

You can manage who receives billing notification emails for your organization on the **Billing notifications** page in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. The page also provides the option to [receive your organization's invoices as email attachments](#receive-your-organizations-invoices-as-email-attachments).

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a Billing account owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA), you must be a Global admin to do the tasks in this article. Billing admins can also make some of these changes, as noted in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
