## Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)

When you buy Microsoft 365 services in the EMEA region, this purchase could be subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT).
  
- If you're located in a European Union Member State, Armenia, Belarus, Norway, Turkey, or United Arab Emirates, and you don't provide your valid local VAT ID, Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. will apply the current local VAT rate, based on the billing country your account is set to.

- If you're located in Liechtenstein, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, or Switzerland, the VAT is applied, whether you provide your VAT ID or not.

- For EU customers, before we can validate your VAT ID, it must be available for verification in the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES). If your VAT ID can't be verified, contact your local tax authority.

You might qualify for VAT zero-rating if:
  
- **You're in a European Union Member State outside Ireland:** You can provide your valid local VAT ID. This lets Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. to VAT zero-rate the transaction. However, you might have a local VAT accounting obligation. If you have any concerns, check with your tax advisers. For instructions, see [Add your VAT ID](#add-your-vat-id).

- **You're in Ireland and have the relevant valid VAT exemption certification:** Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. may be entitled to exempt the transaction from VAT. If you don't, Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. applies the current Irish VAT rate, whether you provide a VAT ID or not.

- **You're in Armenia, Belarus, Norway, Turkey, or United Arab Emirates:** You can provide your local VAT ID. This entitles Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. to VAT zero-rate the transaction. However, you may have a local VAT accounting obligation, so please check with your tax advisers if you have any concerns. For instructions, see [Add your VAT ID](#add-your-vat-id).

## Asia Pacific countries (APAC)

If you're billed by the Microsoft Regional Sales office, "Microsoft Regional Sales Pte. Ltd." appears on your invoice, and you might be charged for any applicable value-added, sales, or similar taxes.
  
If you're billed from one of the following locations, the current local tax is applied. The location is included [on your invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md):
  
- India

## North, Central, and South America

In the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia, various tax rates apply depending on the product nature and your location.
  
If your billing is done by Microsoft Corporation ([see your invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md)), and you signed up for Microsoft 365 outside of the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Chile, and Colombia, then tax is generally not charged.

## Add your VAT ID

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, select the subscription that you want to update.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Service usage address** section, select **Edit service usage address**.
4. On the **Edit service usage address** pane, in the **VAT number** box, enter your VAT ID, including the prefix, and without any spaces.
5. Select **Save**.

## How taxes are calculated

Sales taxes are calculated against the unit price, and then aggregated.

For example:

>*(unit price X tax rate) X quantity = total sales tax*

-or-

>($1.29 X 0.095) X 100 = $12.25
