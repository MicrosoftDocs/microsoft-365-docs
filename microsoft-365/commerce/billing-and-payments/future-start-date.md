# Understand invoicing for future start dates

Sales proposals might include subscriptions that start on a future date. A future start date aligns the start date of a new subscription with the end date of a previous subscription. If your proposal contains subscriptions that start on a future date, you receive an invoice for those subscriptions only when the future start date arrives. Using a future start date ensures that you aren't billed for items that you don't own yet. New subscriptions start on the future start date specified in the proposal. On the start date of the new subscription, we send you an email to let you know that your new subscription is now active and your billing for this subscription will begin immediately. Your next invoice reflects the new charges plus applicable taxes for the new subscription.
