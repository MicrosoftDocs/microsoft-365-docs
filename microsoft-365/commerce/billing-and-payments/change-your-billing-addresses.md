# Change your billing addresses

Your bill or invoice contains three addresses:
  
- **Sold-To Address** Your company name and address, as shown in your organization profile.

- **Bill-To address** The address of your billing department, usually the same as the **Sold-To** address.

- **Service Usage Address** The address where the service is being used, usually the same as the **Sold-To** address. If your organization has remote users or multiple offices, use the address where the majority of your users are located.

In most cases, these addresses are the same. If you need to change one or more of the addresses, you can do that. You can also provide an alternate email address to receive billing notifications and change the alternate email address for other admins.

To learn more about your bill or invoice, see [View your bill or invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md) and [Understand your bill or invoice](understand-your-invoice2.md).
