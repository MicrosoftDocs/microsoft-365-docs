# Change the billing addresses for your Microsoft business subscription

Your invoice for Microsoft business products and services that you own contains the following addresses:
  
- **Sold to Address** Your company name and address, as shown in your organization profile.
- **Bill to address** The address of your billing department, usually the same as the **Sold to** address.
- **Service usage address** The address where the service is used, usually the same as the **Sold to** address. If your organization has remote users or multiple offices, use the address where most your users are located. This address is only used by customers with a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA) billing account type.

In most cases, these addresses are the same. If you need to change one or more of the addresses, you can do that in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a billing account owner or contributor, or a billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For more information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA) billing account type, you must be a global or billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a billing account owner or global admin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't change the country/region for your subscription. That's because the country/region where your organization is headquartered determines which services are available to you, the taxes and billing currency, and the location of the data center. To change your organization's country/region, sign up for a new account, choose the desired country/region, and buy a new subscription.

## Change your Sold-To address

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
2. In the **Navigation menu**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2084771" target="_blank">Billing accounts</a> page, then select a billing account.
3. On the billing account details page, in the **Sold to** section, select **Update sold to** or **Edit**.
4. Update your organization information, then select **Save**.
  
## Change your Bill-To address

You can change your **Bill to** address in the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, the steps to change the address depend on the type of billing account that you have. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

   - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.

3. Select a payment method.
4. In the payment methods details pane, select **Edit**.
5. Update your payment information, select **Save** > **Done**.
