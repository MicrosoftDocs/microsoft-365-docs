# Request a credit for Withholding Tax on your account (Global customers)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your organization is based in India, please see [Request a credit for Withholding Tax on your account (India customers)](withholding-tax-credit-india.md).

Some customers receive Web Direct (Azure and Microsoft 365) invoices billed by a Microsoft entity located in a foreign country. If your organization makes cross-border payments to that entity, the Tax Authority in your country might require you to withhold part of the cross-border payment as withholding tax (WHT). If you withheld taxes as required by your Tax Authority when remitting  payments to Microsoft, this article explains the process for claiming a credit for the tax withheld.

## For invoice pay customers who pay by check or wire

If you withheld tax when remitting payment and deposited the withheld tax with the relevant Tax Authority, you must submit a WHT request to clear the outstanding balance in your account.

Your WHT request must include the following items:

- A completed copy of the [Withholding Tax Credit Form](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/a/f/aaf8306b-79d4-455b-975f-41ce9e67b9cb/wht%20credit%20form%20-%20global.docx) (filled out by the customer)
- A signed or scanned copy of the Withholding Tax Certificate or Receipt

Submit the WHT request by opening a ticket with Microsoft support.

## For customers who pay by credit card

If your payment method is a credit card and you made a full payment to Microsoft, and also paid WHT to the relevant Tax authority, you must submit a WHT request to claim the refund of the tax amount.

Your WHT request must include the following items:

- A completed copy of the [Withholding Tax Credit Form](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/a/f/aaf8306b-79d4-455b-975f-41ce9e67b9cb/wht%20credit%20form%20-%20global.docx) (filled out by the customer)
- A signed or scanned copy of the Withholding Tax Certificate or Receipt

Submit the WHT request by opening a ticket with Microsoft support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Customers can only submit a request for an adjustment or refund of the WHT amount after paying the invoice.
> - The invoice amount on the Withholding Tax Credit Form must match the invoice amount identified in the Withholding Tax Certificate or Receipt. If the invoice amount is different between the two forms, you must specify the reason for the difference in the Withholding Tax Credit Form. This information is checked by the review team, who might ask clarifying questions, if required.
> - Withholding Tax Certificate or Receipt files must be in one of the following file formats: .PDF or image only (.JPEG, .PNG, or .GIF). Additionally, file names must not contain spaces or special characters. File size cannot exceed 1 MB.

After you submit the request, it goes into the approval process where it is either approved for completion or is sent back to you for correction.

If there’s a problem with your request, the review team might require corrections to the withholding amount or replacement of the certificate or receipt. You must resubmit the request before it can be approved. The review team will either approve the request or ask for more changes.

## Approved requests

**For customers paying by check or wire:** Approved WHT requests are settled against the unpaid portion of the invoice amount reflected in Withholding Tax Credit Form.

After your claim is approved, it’s reflected in the next billing cycle. The WHT amount paid is included in the payment section of your next invoice. The amount is also displayed under the paid amount in the customer portal.

**For customers paying by credit card:** After your claim is approved, your overpayment is refunded to your credit card.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If changes are required, the approval process might take longer because of the corrections that must be made and then resubmitted.
> - If you have questions about the WHT request process, please open a ticket with Microsoft support.
