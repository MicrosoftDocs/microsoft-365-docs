## What is my tax rate?

For commercial purchases, we apply taxes in addition to the quoted price of our subscriptions at a rate prescribed by Taiwan Tax Authority. For any tax related questions or planning, please work with your tax advisor.
  
## When will e-Invoice start for my Microsoft 365 services?

Microsoft will replace current computerized invoice with e-Invoice on **September 15th**. For billing prior to September 15th, paper copy tax invoices are mailed directly to customers. After September 15th, e-Invoice will be offered in your Microsoft 365 admin center for view, download, and print, and will no longer be mailed directly to you. 
  
## Where can I find my e-Invoice?

You can view, download, and print your e-Invoice the day after your bill is ready, through your admin center, together with your monthly bill. [View your bill](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).
