# View your bill or invoice

This article is for people who have a Microsoft 365 for business subscription. You must be a global admin or billing admin to do the steps described in this article.
  
If you need help interpreting the charges you see on your bill, see [Understand your bill or invoice](understand-your-invoice2.md) for a detailed walkthrough.
  
 **Not an admin?** Contact your IT administrator for help. 
  
 **Have a problem with your bill?** [Contact support for business products](../../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).

 Watch a short video about viewing your bill or invoice (note that your invoice may appear different from the one in the video). <br><br>
