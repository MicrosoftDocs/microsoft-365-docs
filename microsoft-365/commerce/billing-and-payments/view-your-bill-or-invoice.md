## Receive a copy of your billing statement in email

You can choose to receive a copy of your billing statement as an email attachment. If you do, be aware that:

- An email is sent to both the primary and alternate email address for every person listed as a notification recipient.
- You receive two separate emails: one that lets you know that your bill is ready, with instructions to sign in to the admin center to view it, and a second email that contains the billing statement as an attachment.

### To receive your billing statement in email

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.

2. Under **Receive billing statement as email attachment?** switch the toggle to **On**.

    You can stop receiving the billing statement emails at any time by switching the toggle to **Off**.
