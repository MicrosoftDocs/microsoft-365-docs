# Understand your bill or invoice for Microsoft 365 for business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of January 26, 2021, new bank accounts are no longer supported for customers in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. If you’re an existing customer in one of those countries, you can continue paying for your subscription with an existing bank account, and you can add new subscriptions to it, but only as long as the bank account is in good standing.

Either monthly or annually (depending on the option you chose when you purchased your subscription), you'll receive an email that tells you that your new billing statement is available in the admin center. [Learn how to find and view your bill or invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).
  
Your invoice contains two pages. Page 1 is the invoice summary, and contains general information about the invoice, order, amount due, how to make a payment, and how to contact support.

Page 2 contains details about the billing activity for each subscription.

For descriptions of the fields and terms included in your invoice, see the [Invoice Field Glossary](#invoice-field-glossary) later in this article.
  
## Understand billing concepts

Before you view your invoice, it's helpful to understand a few key billing concepts.
  
### Invoice balance vs. order balance

 **Invoice balance** is the amount shown on your invoice, and is only the amount due for that particular billing period. Your total **order balance** is the sum of all unpaid invoices. You can view your order balance in the **Billing** section of the admin center.
  
### Billing frequency vs. invoice frequency

 **Billing frequency** means how often you are billed. Subscriptions are billed either monthly or annually, depending on what option you chose during the subscription purchase. **Invoice frequency** means how often you receive an invoice. If you chose annual billing, you'll only receive one invoice per year, unless activity for your subscription requires a charge or a credit.
  
If you have more than one order, you'll receive an invoice for each order.
  
## Invoice Field Glossary

The following table describes the fields you might see on your invoice. Some fields listed here might not appear in your invoice, depending on whether you pay by invoice or by credit card or bank account.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Paying by bank account is not available in some countries or regions.
