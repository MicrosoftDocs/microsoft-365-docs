# Billing information for Microsoft 365 for business in Italy

## 1. Where can I get an invoice for my Microsoft 365 for business purchase?

Your invoice is sent to the registered billing notification email address 24 hours after your purchase is confirmed. To download your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want the invoice to include your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID, you must add it before the purchase confirmation.

## 2. How can I add my Codice Fiscale/Tax ID to the invoice I get for the purchase of Microsoft 365 for business?

### During the purchase process (Checkout)

During the checkout purchase process, when you get to step **4. Payment and billing**, select the box to enter a Codice Fiscale/Tax ID. This step is necessary so that you can see it reflected in your purchase invoice.

### For your future purchases

You can add or modify your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID so that the information is reflected in future Microsoft 365 for business purchases. To add or modify your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2084771" target="_blank">Billing accounts</a> page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're in a recurrent billing subscription, the addition or modification of the Codice Fiscale/Tax ID is reflected on the invoice of your next charge.

#### Add your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID

If your invoice number begins with "G," to ensure you can still receive invoices, update your Microsoft account to include your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
2. In the navigation menu, select **Billing**, then select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2084771" target="_blank">**Billing accounts**</a>.
3. Select the billing account you want to update.
4. In the **Tax ID** section, select **Add tax ID**. If you already have a tax ID listed, such as a VAT ID, select **Add another tax ID**.
5. In the **Codice Fiscale ID** field, add your ID, then select **Save**.

## 3. Can I add or modify my Codice Fiscale/Tax ID to an invoice that was already generated?

It's important that you add or modify your Codice Fiscale/Tax ID before you make your purchase. You can't add or modify the Codice Fiscale/Tax ID information after we generate your Microsoft 365 for business invoice.

## 4. Why wasn't an e-invoice issued by Sistema di Interscambio (SDI)?

If a Codice Fiscale/Tax ID isn't provided, e-invoices aren't issued by SDI per Italian e-invoicing regulations. For such scenarios, invoices issued by Microsoft are still available.

## 5. What's the wire payment information for Italy?

For details about making a payment, see [Payment information for Italy](/legal/pay/italy).

## Tax FAQ

###  Why is there a 22% tax rate on my invoice now from Microsoft Srl Italy compared to last monthâ€™s invoice from Microsoft Ireland?

This is a result of the Billing entity change from Microsoft Ireland to Microsoft Srl. Prior to the change, purchases were considered cross-border and the presence of a VAT ID resulted in Reverse Charge (0% tax). With local invoicing, transactions are not cross-border and the tax rate of 22% applies.  Partners in Italy were invoiced from Microsoft Srl Italy on September 1, 2023. Customer Led and Field Led migrated to Microsoft Srl Italy on March 1, 2024.
