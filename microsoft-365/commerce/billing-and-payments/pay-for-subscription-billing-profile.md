# How to pay for your Microsoft business subscription with a billing profile

When you buy a subscription, you pay for it with a billing profile. The billing profile is linked to a specific payment method and can be a credit or debit card, or an invoice, but not a bank account.

If you're not sure if your account has a billing profile, see [Understand billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md). If you don't have a billing profile, see [How to pay for your subscription](pay-for-your-subscription.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 1, 2023, we no longer accept checks as a payment method for subscriptions paid by invoice. Pay by check is no longer available as a payment option, and check payment instructions have been removed from invoices. You can still pay for your invoice by wire transfer. See your invoice for wire transfer payment information. If you're an existing customer who currently pays by check, you have until September 30, 2023 to change to paying by wire transfer, and avoid possible service disruption.

## Paying with recurring billing turned on or off

By default, recurring billing is automatically turned on for all paid subscriptions. Every billing period, we automatically charge the payment method associated with the billing profile to pay for any subscriptions that use that billing profile. If your payment method is declined, you can use the **Pay now** button on the invoice summary in the Microsoft 365 admin center to make a one-time payment for your subscription.

If recurring billing is turned off for a billing profile, you can use the **Pay now** button on the invoice summary in the admin center to pay for it every billing period, regardless of what payment method is linked with the billing profile. You can also pay by wire transfer. Instructions for how to do that are included on the PDF copy of your invoice.

## Directives from the Reserve Bank of India

Currently, some credit card transactions, especially transactions exceeding 5,000 INR, are blocked due to a directive by the Reserve Bank of India. This might affect automatic payments, which means that you might have to make payments manually in the admin center. This directive doesn't affect usage charges.

[Learn more about the Reserve Bank of India directive for recurring payments](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11668&Mode=0).

As of September 30, 2022, Microsoft and other online merchants no longer store credit card information. Microsoft has removed all stored card details from the admin center. To avoid service interruption, you must add and verify a payment method for all subscriptions and billing profiles.

[Learn about the Reserve Bank of India directive for card storage](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12211).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the removal of credit card information, when you view your list of payment methods, the **Expiration Date** and **Status** columns only say "Unknown."

### UPI and NetBanking payment options

The admin center supports two alternate payment options for customers in India:

- UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment is a real-time payment method.
- NetBanking (Internet Banking) provides customers with access to banking services on an online platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UPI and NetBanking are only supported for one-time transactions for existing customers only.

#### How do I make a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

1. If you're a returning customer, when you make a payment, select **UPI / NetBanking** from the **Payment method** drop-down list, then select **Make payment**.
2. You're redirected to the payment partner, BillDesk, where you choose UPI or NetBanking for your payment method.
3. Follow the instructions in BillDesk to complete the transaction.

After you submit the payment, allow time for the payment to appear in the admin center.

#### How am I refunded if I made a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

Refunds are treated as a regular charge and are refunded to your bank account.

## Paying by invoice

If you have a billing profile that is set up to be paid by invoice, you can pay for your subscription with a wire transfer. You can also use a credit or debit card to make a one-time payment by using the **Pay now** button on your invoice.

To be eligible to pay by invoice, you must:

- Be an established customer for at least six months and have no outstanding balances
- Have a subscription cost that exceeds a certain amount (this amount varies by service location)
- Pass a credit check

If a credit check is required, you're notified when you buy your subscription. If you agree to be contacted, you get an email that includes more information about applying for credit approval. Credit checks are usually completed within two business days.

If your billing profile is backed by an invoice, you get an email when your billing statement is ready to view. This email doesn't contain a copy of your billing statement. However, you can choose to [receive your organization's invoices as email attachments](manage-billing-notifications.md#receive-your-organizations-invoices-as-email-attachments). Your billing statement includes details about your options for making a payment, and where to send it. If you enter a purchase order (PO) number in your billing profile, the number appears on your billing statement. For information about accessing billing statements, see [View your bill or invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).

## Where do I send my wire transfer payment?

[Check your invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md) for payment instructions for your country or region. If you're not sure how much you owe, you can check your bill and billing history online on the **Invoices** tab of the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.

## Wire transfer payment processing time

Payments made by wire transfer have processing times that vary, depending on the type of transfer:

- ACH domestic transfers - Five business days. Two to three days to arrive, plus two days to post.
- Wire transfer (domestic) - Four business days. Two days to arrive, plus two days to post.
- Wire transfer (international) - Seven business days. Five days to arrive, plus two days to post.

If your account is approved for payment by wire transfer, the instructions for payment are on the invoice.

## Can I pay my invoice online?

If recurring billing is turned off for your billing profile, you can use a credit or debit card to pay your invoice online. To make a payment, use the **Pay now** button on your invoice in the admin center. To find your invoice, see [View your bill or invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).

## Can I change from my current payment method to paying by invoice?

If your billing profile is backed by credit or debit card, you can only change the payment method to another credit or debit card. You can't change to paying by invoice.

## Can I change from paying by invoice to using a different payment method?

If your billing profile is backed by invoice payments, you can't change the payment method. You can use the **Pay now** button on your invoice to make a one-time payment with a credit or debit card.
