# Request a credit for Withholding Tax on your account (India customers)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your organization is not based in India, please see [Request a credit for Withholding Tax on your account (Global customers)](withholding-tax-credit-global.md).

Customers in India receive Web Direct (Azure and Microsoft 365) invoices billed by Microsoft Regional Sales Pte Ltd. Singapore (MRS) and make cross-border payments to Singapore to settle the invoice. If you withheld taxes when remitting the payment, this article explains the process for claiming a credit for the Withholding Tax (WHT) in your account with MRS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 1, 2023, we no longer accept checks as a payment method for subscriptions paid by invoice. Pay by check is no longer available as a payment option, and check payment instructions have been removed from invoices. You can still pay for your invoice by wire transfer. See your invoice for wire transfer payment information. If you're an existing customer who currently pays by check, you have until September 30, 2023 to change to paying by wire transfer, and avoid possible service disruption.

## For invoice pay customers who pay by wire transfer

If you withheld tax when remitting payment to MRS and deposited the withheld tax with the Income Tax Department, you must submit a WHT request to settle the tax amount withheld in your account.

Your WHT request must include the following items:

- A completed copy of the [Withholding Tax Credit Form](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/2/a/a2a35969-2d54-4faa-ba41-6a50525eba70/WHT%20Credit%20Form%20-%20India.docx) (filled out by the customer)
- A digitally signed TDS Certificate (Form 16A) issued by the Indian Income Tax Department (provided by the customer)

Submit the WHT request by opening a ticket with Microsoft support.

## For customers who pay by credit card

If your payment method is a credit card and you made a full payment to MRS, and also paid WHT to the Income Tax Department, you must submit a WHT request to claim the refund of the tax amount.

Your WHT request must include the following items:

- A completed copy of the [Withholding Tax Credit Form](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/2/a/a2a35969-2d54-4faa-ba41-6a50525eba70/WHT%20Credit%20Form%20-%20India.docx) (filled out by the customer)
- A digitally signed TDS Certificate (Form 16A) issued by the Indian Income Tax Department (provided by the customer)

Submit the WHT request by opening a ticket with Microsoft support

## Timelines to submit the TDS Certificate together with the Withholding Tax Credit Form

The following table shows the due dates and timelines to submit digitally signed TDS Certificate (Form 16A) forms for each quarter.

| Quarter | Period | Due date for issuance of TDS Certificate (Form 16A) | Extended timelines to submit Form 16A together with the Withholding Tax Credit Form |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | April - June | 15-Aug | 31-Aug |
| 2 | July - September | 15-Nov | 30-Nov |
| 3 | October - December | 15-Feb | 28-Feb |
| 4 | January - March | 15-Jun | 30-Jun |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Customers can only submit a request for a refund of the WHT amount after paying the invoice.
> - The invoice amount on the Withholding Tax Credit Form must match the invoice amount identified in the TDS certificate. If the invoice amount is different between the two forms, you must specify the reason for the difference in the Withholding Tax Credit Form. This information is checked by the review team, who might ask clarifying questions, if required.
> - TDS certificate files must be in one of the following file formats: .PDF or Image only (.JPEG, .PNG, or .GIF). Additionally, file names must not contain spaces or special characters. File size cannot exceed 1 MB.

After you submit the request, it goes into the approval process where it is either approved for completion or is sent back to you for correction.

If there's a problem with your request, the review team might require corrections to the withholding amount or replacement of the TDS certificate. You must resubmit the request before it can be approved. The review team will either approve the request or ask for more changes.

## Approved requests

**For customers paying by wire transfer:** Approved WHT requests are settled against the unpaid portion of the invoice amount reflected in the Withholding Tax Credit Form.

After your claim is approved, it's reflected in the next billing cycle. The WHT amount paid is included in the payment section of your next invoice. The amount is also displayed under the paid amount in the customer portal.

**For customers paying by credit card:** After your claim is approved, your overpayment is refunded to your credit card.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If changes are required, the approval process might take longer because of the corrections that must be made and then resubmitted.
> - If you have questions about the WHT request process, please open a ticket with Microsoft support.
