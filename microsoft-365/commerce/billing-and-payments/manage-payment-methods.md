# Manage payment methods

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of January 26, 2021, new bank accounts are no longer supported for customers in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. If youâ€™re an existing customer in one of those countries, you can continue paying for your subscription with an existing bank account, and you can add new subscriptions to it, but only as long as the bank account is in good standing.

When you buy business products or services from Microsoft, you can use an existing payment method, or add a new one. You can use a credit or debit card, or bank account to pay for the things you buy.

If your business account has a billing profile, and you are a billing profile owner or billing profile contributor, you can use the billing profile that's backed by a credit card or invoice payment to make purchases or pay bills. If you're a billing invoice manager, you can only use a billing profile to pay bills. To learn more about billing profiles and roles, see [Manage billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md).

If your business account doesn't have a billing profile, any Global or Billing admin can manage and use any bank account that is added to the business account. However, you can only manage or use credit cards that you add.

> [!NOTE]
> The option to pay with a bank account is not available in some countries or regions.
>
> You must use a payment method issued from the same country as your tenant.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Add a payment method

Adding a payment method doesn't associate any subscriptions with it. To assign a single subscription to the payment method, see [Change a payment method for a single subscription](#change-a-payment-method-for-a-single-subscription). To replace all subscriptions that use another payment method with the new one, see [Replace a payment method](#replace-a-payment-method).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Select **Add a payment method**.
3. On the **Payment methods** page, pick a payment method from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the information for the new card or bank account, then select **Add**.

## Update payment method details

You can change the name on the credit or debit card, billing address, or expiration date for an existing payment method. However, you can't change the card or account number. If the account number has changed, [replace it with a different payment method](#replace-a-payment-method), and then [delete the old one](#delete-a-payment-method).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Select the row of the payment method to update. In the right pane, select **Edit**.
3. Update your payment method information, including the name on the credit or debit card, billing address, or expiration date, and then select **Save**.

## Replace a payment method

When you replace a payment method, you replace it for all subscriptions and billing profiles that use the same payment method. Replacing a payment method doesn't delete the existing payment method. It's still available for you to select and use for other subscriptions and billing profiles.

To change the payment method for a single subscription, see [Change a payment method for a single subscription](#change-a-payment-method-for-a-single-subscription).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Select the row of the payment method to replace. The right pane lists all billing profiles and individual subscriptions that use the selected payment method.
3. In the right pane, select **Replace payment method for all items**.
4. To use an existing payment method, choose one from the drop-down list, then select **Replace**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have subscriptions associated with a billing profile, you can only use a credit or debit card to pay for them. If you have bank accounts listed on the **Payment methods** page, they aren't available to select in the drop-down list.
5. To add a new payment method, select **Add payment method**.
6. In the **Add a payment method** pane, enter the account information, then select **Save**. You must use a payment method from the same country as your tenant.
7. The new payment method is already selected in the drop-down list. Select **Replace**.

## Change a payment method for a single subscription

You can change the payment method used to pay for a single subscription.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, find the subscription that you want to pay for with the alternate payment method.
3. Select the three dots (more actions), then select **Replace payment method**.
4. In the **Replace payment method** pane, from the drop-down list, choose an alternate payment method, or choose to add a payment method.
5. If you add a payment method, enter the card or account details, then select **Save**.
6. Verify that the selected payment method is correct, then select **Replace**.

## Delete a payment method

You can only delete a payment method that isn't attached to a subscription or billing profile. This applies to all subscriptions, whatever their status.

### Delete a payment method with no subscriptions or billing profiles attached

If a payment method isn't associated with any subscriptions or billing profiles, you can immediately delete it.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Find the payment method to delete, select the three dots, then select **Delete**.
3. At the bottom of the right pane, select **Delete**.

### Delete a payment method with subscriptions or billing profiles attached

If a payment method is attached to any subscriptions or billing profiles, first replace it with an existing payment method, or add a new one, then delete the old payment method.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Select the row for the payment method to delete. The right pane lists existing subscriptions that use that payment method.
3. In the right pane, select **Delete**.
4. To use an existing payment method, choose one from the drop-down list, select **Next**, and then select **Delete**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have subscriptions associated with a billing profile, you can only use a credit card to pay for them. If you have bank accounts listed on the **Payment methods** page, they aren't available to choose in the drop-down list.
5. To add a new payment method, select **Add payment method**.
6. Choose the type of payment method that you want to add, enter the account information, and then select **Save**.
7. The new payment method is already selected in the drop-down list. Select **Next**.
8. Select **Delete**.

## Troubleshoot payment methods

| Issue | Troubleshooting steps |
|:----------|:-----|
|**I get an error message that says, "The browser is currently set to block cookies."** |Set your browser to allow third-party cookies and try again. |
|**My credit or debit card was declined.** |If you pay by credit or debit card, and your card is declined, you receive an email that says Microsoft was unable to process the payment. Double-check that the card details&mdash;card number, expiration date, name on the card, and address, including city, state, and ZIP code&mdash;appear exactly as they do on the card and your statement. You can update your card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Settle balance** link in the **Billing** section of the subscription details page. For more information, see [What if I have an outstanding balance?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-i-have-an-outstanding-balance)  <br/><br/>  If you continue to see the "declined" message, contact your bank. It's possible that your card isn't active. If you recently received the card in the mail with an updated expiration date, make sure it's activated. Your bank can also tell you whether your card isn't approved for online, international, or recurring transactions. |
|**I want to update a card or bank account number.** |You can't change the card or account number on an existing payment method. If your card or account number has changed, [replace it with a different payment method](#replace-a-payment-method), which moves all active subscriptions from the payment method to the new one, then [delete the old payment method](#delete-a-payment-method-with-no-subscriptions-or-billing-profiles-attached). |
|**I only have one card or bank account on my account and I want to remove it.** |If you only have one payment method, you must [replace it with a new payment method](#replace-a-payment-method) before you can delete it. |
|**I can't add my card or bank account.**  |You must use a payment method issued from the same country as your tenant. If you have trouble entering your card or bank account information, you can [contact support](../../business-video/get-help-support.md). |
