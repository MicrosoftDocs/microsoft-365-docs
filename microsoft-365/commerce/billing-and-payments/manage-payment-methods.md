# Manage payment methods for Microsoft business accounts

When you buy Microsoft business products or services, you can use an existing payment method to pay for then, or add a new one. You can use a credit or debit card to pay for the things you buy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You must use a payment method issued from the same country/region as your tenant.
> - The option to pay with a bank account is no longer available.

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a billing account owner or contributor, or a billing profile owner or contributor to dp the tasks in this article. For more information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Understand your Microsoft business billing profile](manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be a global or billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [[About admin roles]](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- If you have an MCA billing account type and you’re a billing profile owner or contributor, you can use the billing profile that's backed by a credit or debit card or invoice payment to make purchases or pay bills. If you're a billing invoice manager, you can only use a billing profile to pay bills. To learn more about billing profiles and roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing profile](manage-billing-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a billing account owner or global admin.

## Add a payment method

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Adding a payment method doesn't associate it with any subscriptions or billing profiles you have. If you want to use the new payment method to pay for a subscription, you must move a subscription to it, or replace an existing payment method in a billing profile.

If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can replace the payment method for all subscriptions that use another payment method as part of adding a new one. You can also [replace a payment method](#replace-a-payment-method) later on. To assign a single subscription to the payment method, see [Replace the payment method for a single subscription](#replace-the-payment-method-for-a-single-subscription).

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**, then select **View payment methods**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848039" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page, and select the **Payment methods** tab.
2. Select **Add a payment method**.
3. On the **Add a payment method** page, enter the information for the new payment method, then select **Save**.
4. To use the new payment method to pay for all subscriptions currently paid for with another payment method, select **Replace an existing payment method**.
5. Select the payment method you want to replace, then select **Replace**.

## Update payment method details

You can change the name, billing address, or expiration date for an existing credit or debit card. However, you can't change the card number. If the account number has changed, [replace it with a different payment method](#replace-a-payment-method), and then [delete the old one](#delete-a-payment-method).

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**, then select **View payment methods**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848039" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page, and select the **Payment methods** tab.
2. Select the payment method to update. In the edit pane, select **Edit**.
3. Update your payment method information, including the name on the credit or debit card, billing address, or expiration date, and then select **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you update a credit or debit card, you must enter the security code before any changes are saved.

## Replace a payment method

When you replace an existing payment method, you can add a new one, or use a payment method that’s already in your account. You can replace the payment method in the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, the steps to replace a payment method depend on the type of billing account that you have. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

- [Replace the payment method for a billing profile](#replace-the-payment-method-for-a-billing-profile) (MCA billing account types only)
- [Replace the payment method for a single subscription](#replace-the-payment-method-for-a-single-subscription) (MOSA billing account types only)
- [Replace a single payment method for all subscriptions](#replace-a-single-payment-method-for-all-subscriptions) (MOSA billing account types only)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Replacing a payment method doesn't delete the existing payment method. The old payment method is still available for you to select and use for other subscriptions and billing profiles. Learn how to delete a payment method.
