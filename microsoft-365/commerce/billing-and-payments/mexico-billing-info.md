# Billing information for Microsoft 365 for business in Mexico

## 1. Where can I get an invoice for my Microsoft 365 for business purchase?

Your invoice is sent to the registered billing notification email address 24 hours after your purchase is confirmed. To download your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want the invoice to include your TAX ID, you must add it before the purchase confirmation.

## 2. How can I add my RFC (Federal Taxpayers Registry) to the invoice I get for the purchase of Microsoft 365 for business?

### During the purchase process (Checkout)

During the checkout purchase process, when you get to step **4. Payment and billing**, select the box to enter a TAX ID. This step is necessary so that you can see it reflected in your purchase invoice.

### For your future purchases

You can add or modify your RFC so that the information is reflected in future Microsoft 365 for business purchases. To add or modify your RFC, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2084771" target="_blank">Billing accounts</a> page.

## 3. Can I add or modify my RFC to a purchase that has already been confirmed?

It's important that you add or modify your RFC before you make your purchase. After your Microsoft 365 for business purchase is confirmed, you can't add or modify your billing information.

## 4. Why don't I get a CFDI (Digital Government Invoice)?

Microsoft Corporation, being a foreign entity, is exempt from providing a CFDI electronic invoice.

## 5. Is the invoice I receive valid for my accounting operations in Mexico?

An invoice generated by foreign entities (in this case Microsoft Corporation) that includes the respective TAX ID is valid for tax purposes in Mexico. (We recommend consulting your accountant for more information).
