# Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles

A billing profile contains payment method and invoice information associated with your Microsoft business billing account. You use a billing profile to pay for business products and services that you buy from Microsoft. A billing profile is automatically created when a billing account is created, and you can add new billing profiles at any time. For information about billing accounts, see [Understand your Microsoft billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This article only applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement billing account type.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- You must have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, and be a billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [What are billing profile roles?](#what-are-billing-profile-roles).

## What are billing profile roles?

Billing profile roles have permissions to control purchases, and view and manage invoices. You can assign these roles to users who track, organize, and pay invoices. Only a billing profile owner can grant access to billing profile roles. You can assign the following roles to users:

| Role                         | Description                                                                      |
|----------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Billing profile owner        | Can assign roles, edit the billing profile, use it in a purchase, pay bills, and view the billing profile. |
| Billing profile contributor  | Can edit the billing profile, use it in a purchase, pay bills, and view the billing profile. |
| Billing profile reader       | Has a read-only view of everything in a billing profile. |
| Invoice manager              | Can view and pay bills and has a read-only view of everything in a billing profile. |
