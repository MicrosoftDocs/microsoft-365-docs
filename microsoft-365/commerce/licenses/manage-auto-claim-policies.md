# Manage auto-claim policies in the Microsoft 365 admin center

As an admin, you typically assign licenses to users either manually, or by using group-based licensing. For some products and services, you can use an *auto-claim policy* to let users automatically claim a license without requiring you to assign them. With an auto-claim policy in place, users can automatically claim a license for a product the first time that they sign in to an app that requires a license. By using auto-claim policies, you manage the products for which users can automatically claim licenses. You can also control which products those licenses come from. You manage auto-claim policies in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Auto-claim policies are currently only available on a product-by-product basis.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global admin to create and manage auto-claim policies. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Global admin.

## Turn the auto-claim policy feature on or off

By default, the auto-claim policy feature is turned off. Before you can use the feature, you must first turn it on in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After you turn on the feature, you can create an auto-claim policy.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, the auto-claim feature is turned on by default, and the auto-claim policies for certain apps and services are preconfigured.

### Turn on auto-claim policies

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
2. In the **Navigation menu**, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
3. In the center of the page, select the **Turn on setting** button.

### Turn off auto-claim policies

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743" target="_blank">Org settings</a> page.
2. Near the bottom of the table, select **User owned apps and services**.
3. In the **User owned apps and services** pane, clear the box for **Let users auto-claim licenses the first time they sign in**.
4. Select **Save**.

If you already have an active policy, but you don't want any more users to claim licenses, [turn off the policy](#turn-a-policy-on-or-off). When you turn off an auto-claim policy, no more users can claim a license from that point on. However, users who already claimed a license don't lose their license.

## Create an auto-claim policy

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab lists the policies that you create. On this tab, you can see the following items: the name of the policy, the app that is associated with the policy, the product that's assigned to the policy, the number of available licenses, and the status of the policy.

When you create an auto-claim policy, you can add a backup product to it. If the primary product is out of licenses, the backup product is used to assign licenses to users. You can add up to four backup products and [change the order in which they're used](#change-the-assigning-order-for-backup-products). To learn more, see [Add or remove backup products](#add-or-remove-backup-products).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can only create one auto-claim policy. The number of policies you can create will increase as more products are able to use this feature.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. On the **Name this auto-claim policy** page, enter a name for the policy, then select **Next**.
4. On the **Set an auto-claim app and product** page, select an app and the subscription to assign licenses from.
5. If you want to add a backup product, select **Add a backup product to this policy**, then select the product from the list.
6. Select **Next**.
7. On the **Select apps** page, select or clear the boxes for the apps to include or exclude with the license, then select **Next**.
8. If you added one or more backup products, repeat step 7 for each product. Otherwise, go to step 9.
9. On the **Review and finish** page, verify the new policy information, make any necessary changes, then select **Create policy**.
10. Select **Close**.

## Turn a policy on or off

When you turn off a policy, no more users can claim licenses under that policy. The change doesn't affect users who already claimed licenses under that policy.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select the policy that you want to edit.
3. In the details pane, under **Turn this policy on or off**, select or clear the check box.
4. Select **Save** to close the details pane.

## Edit the policy friendly name

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select the policy that you want to edit.
3. In the details pane, in the **Policy name** section, select **Edit**.
4. Enter a new policy name, then select **Save**.
5. Select **Save** to close the details pane.

## Add or remove backup products

When you create an auto-claim policy, you add a product to it. Licenses are then automatically assigned to users from that pool of licenses. You can add or remove products for an auto-claim policy at any time. If you already have one product associated with the policy, any products that you add are considered backup products. When the available number of licenses from the first product are used up, the policy assigns licenses from the next backup product on the list. You [can reorder the list of products](#change-the-assigning-apps-and-services) as you like.

When you remove a backup product, it's no longer used to assign licenses. Users with an existing license still have that license, but no new users can receive licenses for that product.

> [!NOTE]
> An auto-claim policy must contain at least one product. You can't remove all products from a policy. If you don't want to assign licenses from a specific auto-claim policy anymore, [turn off the policy](#view-an-auto-claim-policy-report).

### Add a backup product

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select the policy that you want to edit.
3. In the details pane, at the bottom, select **Add a backup product to this policy**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see this link, it's because you only have one product associated with your account.
4. In the **Add a product** pane, use the drop-down to choose a product to add to the policy, then select **Add**.
5. Select **Save** to close the details pane.

### Remove a backup product

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select the policy that you want to edit.
3. In the details pane, at the bottom, select **Remove a product**.
4. In the **Remove a product from the policy** pane, select the box for the policy that you want to remove, then select **Save**.
5. Close the details pane.

## Change the assigning apps and services

Each product has a collection of apps and services associated with it. For each product in your auto-claim policy, you can specify which apps and services to include when a user is automatically assigned a license to that product.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.

5. Check or clear the boxes for apps and services that you want users to have or not have access to.
6. When you're finished, select **Save**, then close the details pane.

## Change the assigning order for backup products

If you have backup products assigned to the policy, you can change the order in which they're used to assign licenses when users sign in to the app.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select the policy that you want to edit.
3. In the details pane, in the **Product licenses** section, select the box next to the product that you want to move, then select **Move up** or **Move down**.
4. Repeat step 3 for each product that you want to reorder.
5. When you're finished reordering the products, select **Save** to close the details pane.

## View an auto-claim policy report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> **Licenses** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134398" target="_blank">Auto-claim policy</a> tab.
2. Select **View report**. The **Auto-claim policy report** page lists all licenses assigned from each policy in the last 90 days. By default, the page shows the past 90 days.
3. To change the time period shown, select the **Past 30 days** drop-down list. You can view reports for the past 1, 7, 30, and 90 days.

## Auto-claim policies for Microsoft Power Apps

Admins can now create auto-claim policies for Power Apps per user licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center, similar to how they can create auto-claim policies for other Microsoft products and services. After the policy is set, any user in the organization who requests an individual Power Apps license is automatically granted one.

If a user lacks a standalone Power Apps license and launches an app that requires a premium license, the system automatically grants a Power Apps per user license to the user.

If a user without a standalone Power Apps license launches an app within a Managed environment, they're automatically granted a Power Apps per user license.

## Auto-claim policies for Microsoft Power Automate

Auto-claim for Power Automate licenses is supported for the following plans:

- Power Automate premium plan
- Power Automate per user plan

When the auto-claim policy is configured and a user doesn't have a license for the product, the user is automatically assigned a license when they take any of the following actions:

**For Power Automate per user plans**

- Trigger a premium cloud flow 
- Save a premium cloud flow
- Turn on a premium cloud flow

**For Power Automate premium plans**

In addition to the actions listed in **For Power Automate per user plans**, the following actions also apply:

- Trigger a premium cloud flow with Attended Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
- Save a premium cloud flow with Attended RPA
- Turn on a premium cloud flow with Attended RPA

## Next steps

You can periodically return to the **Auto-claim policy** tab to see a list of users who have claimed licenses under the policies you created.
