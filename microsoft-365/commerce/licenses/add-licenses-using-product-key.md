# Add licenses to or extend a subscription paid for using a product key

Prepaid licenses are issued to you as a 25-character alphanumeric code. After you have purchased the licenses you need, you can add them to your subscription. You can also use a product key to extend the expiration date of your subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to purchase a new product key, you can always choose to add a credit card or bank account to your subscription to pay for more licenses or to extend your subscription expiration date. For more information, see [Renew your subscription](../subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md).
