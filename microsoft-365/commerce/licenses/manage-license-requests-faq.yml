          A *License Reservation* allows a customer to place a License Reservation order to migrate on-premises assets to the Cloud without a Purchase Order.

          - Only Online Services are eligible for License Reservation orders
          - Reservation orders are a financial obligation that is realized during the True-Up or Annual Order process. This is based on the Usage Date of the reservation and the quantity reserved.
          - You can place Reservation orders for the current date or a future usage that is no more than six months in the future.
          - You can cancel Reservation orders within 72 hours of the usage date (weekends and holidays included).
          - Reservations can't be placed if the enrollment has expired or in the last month before the enrollment expires. Consult your Microsoft Reseller about ordering options instead.

          1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Your products</a> page, select the **Volume licensing** tab, then select **View Reservation**.

              >[!NOTE]

              > A message displays if you don't have any previous reservation orders.

      - question: |
          At anniversary time, can I pay only for the licenses I have used
        answer: |
          No, you must pay for all the licenses you committed to when you reserved them.

      - question: |
          What services are available for Reservation orders
        answer: |
          Availability of services is based on customer eligibility and whether Microsoft products are available through reservation orders. Services that are eligible for Reservation are listed in the Online Services screen.

          Microsoft volume licensing has three categories of Online Services Reservations.

          - **Standard Reservations**: Products configured for this type of reservation are available to customers with a valid Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft 365 admin center sign-in credentials.
          - **License Reservation Only**: Products configured for this type of reservation require that customers have either a prior purchase (Order history) or Price fixed (Special Pricing) in order to see the offer on Microsoft 365 Admin center for reservation. This category includes some of our more complex product configurations such as Add On services that require a base license. Microsoft uses this categorization in order to reduce the risk that customers unintentionally order incorrect services. Your Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner should be able to assist you in placing the necessary orders.
          - A third category of Services aren't configured for online reservation, so your Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner needs to place always a manual order.

          >[!NOTE]
          >
          > For reservations to be available, you must have already signed the Updated Enterprise Agreement (uEA) Amendment or have an agreement from 2011 or later. The product must have been previously ordered or be price locked in the Customer Price Sheet (CPS).

      - question: |
          Who is eligible to place Reservation orders
        answer: |
          In the Microsoft 365 admin center, only the Online Administrator and Online Service Manager with the **Manage Reservation** permission can create Reservation orders. 
          
          >[!NOTE]
          > 
          > Manage Reservation permissions must be specifically assigned to the OSM admin.

          A Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner can place a reservation on behalf of their customer if granted permission by the customer.

      - question: |
          What if I don't have the authority to accept the Reservation Commitment required for submitting a Reservation order
        answer: |
          A Reservation order is a financial commitment to purchase reserved items. If you don't have the authority to accept this commitment, work with the person in your organization who is authorized to do so.

      - question: |
          Who can I contact with other questions regarding Reservation orders
        answer: |
          Contact your Partner or Microsoft Representative with any questions.
