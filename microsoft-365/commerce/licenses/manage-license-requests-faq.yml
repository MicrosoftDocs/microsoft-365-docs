      - question: |
          At anniversary time, can I pay only for the licenses I have used?
        answer: |
          No, you must pay for all the licenses you committed to when you reserved them.

      - question: |
          What services are available for Reservation orders?
        answer: |
          Availability of services is based on customer eligibility and whether Microsoft products are available through reservation orders. Services that are eligible for reservation are listed on the Online Services pop-up.

          Microsoft volume licensing has three categories of Online Services Reservations.

          - **Standard Reservations**: Products configured for this type of reservation are available to customers with a valid Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft 365 admin center sign-in credentials.
          - **License Reservation Only**: Products configured for this type of reservation require that customers have either a prior purchase (Order history) or Price fixed (Special Pricing) to see the offer on Microsoft 365 Admin center for reservation. This category includes some of our more complex product configurations such as Add On services that require a base license. Microsoft uses this categorization to reduce the risk that customers unintentionally order incorrect services. Your Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner should be able to assist you in placing the necessary orders.
          - A third category of Services isn't configured for online reservation, so your Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner needs to always place a manual order.

          >[!NOTE]
          >
          > For reservations to be available, you must have already signed the Updated Enterprise Agreement (uEA) Amendment or have an agreement from 2011 or later. The product must have been ordered previously or be price locked in the Customer Price Sheet (CPS).

      - question: |
          What if I don't have the authority to accept the Reservation Commitment required for submitting a Reservation order?
        answer: |
          A Reservation order is a financial commitment to purchase reserved items. If you don't have the authority to accept this commitment, work with the person in your organization who is authorized to do so.

      - question: |
          Who can I contact with other questions regarding Reservation orders?
        answer: |
          Contact your Partner or Microsoft Representative with any questions.
