# Understand subscriptions and licenses in Microsoft 365 for business

This article explains the relationship between subscriptions and licenses, and provides additional information about [who can assign licenses](#find-out-who-can-assign-licenses), [understanding what happens when you assign a license to someone](#understand-what-happens-when-you-assign-a-license-to-someone), and [how many devices can people install Office on](#how-many-devices-can-people-install-office-on). It also includes links to [understanding licenses for non-user mailboxes](#understand-licenses-for-non-user-mailboxes), and [Articles about managing licenses](#articles-about-managing-licenses).
  
When you buy a subscription to Microsoft 365 for business, you sign up for a set of applications and services that you pay for on a either a monthly or an annual basis. The applications and services that you receive as part of your subscription depend on which product you purchased, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for business or Microsoft 365 Business Standard. You can review what comes with each product on the [Buy Microsoft 365 page](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr1). 

When you buy a subscription, you specify the number of licenses that you need, based on how many people you have in your organization. After your purchase is complete, you create accounts for people, and then assign a license to each person. As your organizational needs change, you can buy more licenses to accommodate new people, or reassign licenses to other users when someone leaves your organization. 

If you have more than one subscription, you can assign licenses to different people for each subscription. For example, all of your users could be assigned to all Microsoft 365 applications and services as part of an Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription, while a subset of users could also be assigned to Visio Online through a separate Visio subscription.
