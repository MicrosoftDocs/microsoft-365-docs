The Teams admin installs Viva Learning (Preview) and applies permission policies through the Teams admin center.

    1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.

    2. Select **Teams** > **Update policies**.

    3. Select **Add**. 

    4. Name the update policy, add a policy, and turn on **Show preview features**.

2. The admin must notify users of the policy update so that they move their build into Public Preview for Teams. 

    1. User must select their profile image --> About --> Public Preview.

4. After **Manage app** settings, go to **Permission policies** and **Setup policies** to grant permission to employees who should have access to Viva Learning (Preview) as part of your organization's participation in the preview.

> [!NOTE]
>  If your organization is in Ring 4.0 as part of Teams TAP100 program, you might need to enable approved users in Ring 3.0 to access Viva Learning (Preview). <br><br>As part of the preview, Viva Learning (Preview) is released in Ring 3.0. If your organization is in Ring 4.0, you won’t see Viva Learning (Preview) on the **Manage apps** page. To test the app, you need to create a custom apps permission policy, set it to **Allow all apps**, and assign it to Ring 3.0 approved users. <br><br>   ![TAP-AppsPermission-Plcy page showing Allow all apps selected.](../media/learning/learning-app-tap-appspermission-plcy.png)
