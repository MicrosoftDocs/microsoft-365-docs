The Teams admin installs Viva Learning (Preview) and applies permission policies through the Teams admin center.

## Manage settings for Viva Learning (Preview)

You must be an administrator in the Teams admin center to perform these tasks.

To make Viva Learning (Preview) available for users in your organization, follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.

4. After **Manage app** settings, go to **Permission policies** and **Setup policies** to grant permission to employees who should have access to Viva Learning (Preview) as part of your organization's participation in the preview.

> [!NOTE]
>  If your organization is in Ring 4.0 as part of Teams TAP100 program, you might need to enable approved users in Ring 3.0 to access Viva Learning (Preview). <br><br>As part of the preview, Viva Learning (Preview) is released in Ring 3.0. If your organization is in Ring 4.0, you wonâ€™t see Viva Learning (Preview) on the **Manage apps** page. To test the app, you need to create a custom apps permission policy, set it to **Allow all apps**, and assign it to Ring 3.0 approved users. <br><br>   ![TAP-AppsPermission-Plcy page showing Allow all apps selected.](../media/learning/learning-app-tap-appspermission-plcy.png)
