# How to use LinkedIn Learning in Viva Learning

LinkedIn Learning is available for everyone in Viva Learning. You can enable or disable LinkedIn Learning as a content source from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Only the LinkedIn Learning global catalog is available for integration. This means that you can’t integrate custom content, curated assets, or aggregations from Learning Hub. LinkedIn Learning also doesn’t sync recommendations, in-progress, or saved courses between LinkedIn Learning and Viva Learning.

LinkedIn Learning reporting includes engagement from Viva Learning when learners are signed in to their LinkedIn accounts. For learner activity to appear on LinkedIn Learning reports, users need to log in with LinkedIn Learning enterprise credentials.

Advanced features including Instructor Q&A, Exercise Files, Certificates, and Transcripts won’t show in Viva Learning. Users can access these by choosing the **Open in LinkedIn Learning** option in the toolbar.

Note: Everyone has access free access to the select 125 free courses. For more courses, you'll need a premium subscription to Viva Learning.

Note: Users sign in to non-Microsoft and LinkedIn Learning Pro learnings in a browser or embedded viewer. This configured learning is subject to the separate license, privacy and service terms between your organization and the third party, and not the Viva Learning terms. Before selecting this type of learning, verify you have an agreement in place for your organization and users.

To enable or disable LinkedIn learning as a content source, follow the steps to [manage content in your Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/learning/content-sources-365-admin-center).
