# Overview of the Tenants page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you manage customer tenant accounts by selecting **Tenants** in the left navigation pane to open the Tenants page. The Tenants page contains a list of all your customer tenants. You can select a tenant to view detailed information including contact details and deployment status.

The Tenants page also includes the following options:

- **Export:** Select to export tenant data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file.
- **Manage Tags:** Select to add, edit, or delete a tag.
- **Assign Tags:** Select to assign a tag to a tenant.
- **Search:** Enter keywords to quickly locate a specific tenant in the list.

## Tenant list

The tenant list provides insights into the different customer tenants that you have a contract with, including their Lighthouse management status. The tenant list also lets you tag tenants to provide different filters throughout Lighthouse, and drill down to learn more about a given tenant and the status of its deployment plan.

After your customer tenants meet the [Lighthouse onboarding requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md), their status will show as **Active** in the tenant list.

The tenant list lets you:

- Automatically sort tenants by active, inactive, and ineligible.
- Export the tenant list.
- Assign and manage tags.
- Search for tenants by name.
- Filter tenants by status, delegated admin privilege (DAP), and tags.

To inactivate a tenant or view and manage tags, select the three dots (more actions) next to the tenant name. You can view individual tenants by either selecting the tenant name or by selecting one of the tags assigned to the tenant.

For information on how to add customer tenants, see [Add and manage multiple tenants in your Partner Center account](/partner-center/multi-tenant-account).

## Tenant status

The following table shows the different statuses and their meaning. For information on how to troubleshoot customer tenant statuses, see [Troubleshoot error messages and problems in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse: Customer tenant onboarding](m365-lighthouse-troubleshoot.md#customer-tenant-onboarding).<br><br>

| Status           | Description                                                                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active           | This customer tenant can be actively managed and monitored in Lighthouse for users and devices with required licenses.      |
| Inactive         | Your organization has excluded this customer tenant from Lighthouse management.                                    |
| Limited          | This customer tenant has access to only a limited set of experiences in Lighthouse, including GDAP setup and management, user search, user details, tenant tagging, and service health. <br> Select the tenant name to see a detailed status of Lighthouse management requirements. For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).|
| In process       | An error occurred during the onboarding process for this customer tenant and we're working on a fix. If this error persists for more than 24 hours, please contact Support. |

> [!NOTE]
> Once you inactivate a customer tenant, you can't take action on the tenant until the inactivation process completes. It may take up to 48 hours for inactivation to complete. If you decide to reactivate a customer tenant, it may take up to 48 hours for data to reappear.

## Tenant tags

To help organize your customer tenants and easily filter the existing views, you can create and assign tags to your tenants. To learn more, see [Manage your tenant list in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-manage-tenant-list.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can create up to 30 tags across all tenant.

## Tenant details page

To view detailed customer tenant information, select a tenant from the list of tenants. The tenant details page contains contact information and deployment plan status.

### Overview tab

On the Overview tab, you can view customer tenant overview information, contact information, and Microsoft 365 service usage.

#### Tenant overview section

The Tenant overview section provides information about the customer tenant from its Microsoft 365 account.<br><br>

| Tenant information    | Description|
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Roles    | The roles assigned to you in the tenant. Roles determine which tasks you can complete for customers, and what data you can view.|
| Headquarters    | Where the tenant is located.|
| Industry    |The organization's industry.|
| Customer domain    |The organization's domain.|
| Website    |The organization's website. You may edit this field if no data is provided.|
| Total users    |The number of users assigned in the tenant. You may select this number to open the Users page for that tenant.|
| Total devices|The number of devices enrolled in the tenant. You may select this number to open the Devices page for that tenant.|

#### Contacts section

The Contacts section provides information for key contacts within the tenants you manage, such as:

- Name
- Title
- Phone
- Email
- Notes

The **Notes** column shows information for the tenant, such as engagement preferences, location, time zone, and details about their role within the organization.

To edit details, add notes, or delete an existing contact, select the contact name from the list. In the **Edit contact** pane, edit or delete the contact. To add another contact, select **+Add contact**.

#### Microsoft 365 services usage section

Lighthouse provides insights into Microsoft 365 services usage, including how many users within a customer tenant are licensed and actively using each service. The **Active users & devices** column indicates the number of users or devices that have signed in to the service at least once in the past 28 days. The **Change in activity** column indicates change in active users and devices since last month.

The **Microsoft 365 services usage** section contains two sub-sections:

- **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse-enabled services:** Services that can be managed within the Lighthouse portal.
- **Additional Microsoft 365 services:** Services that are included in the Microsoft 365 suite but can't be managed within the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal at this time.

### Deployment Plan tab

The Deployment Plans tab provides status on a customer tenant's deployment plan. The deployment steps in the list are based on the baseline applied to the tenant. To see deployment step details, select a deployment step from the list.

The Deployment Plan tab also includes the following options:

- **Export:** Select to export deployment step data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file.
- **Refresh:** Select to retrieve the most current deployment step data.
- **Search:** Enter keywords to quickly locate a specific deployment step in the list.
