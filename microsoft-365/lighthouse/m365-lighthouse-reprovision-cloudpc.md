# Reprovision a Windows 365 Cloud PC in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse supports reprovisioning of Cloud PCs that have a provisioning policy. You may need to reprovision a device for a new user or if the device isn't working properly. When a reprovision is triggered, the Cloud PC is deleted and re-created as a new Cloud PC. All user data, applications, and customizations are deleted.

## Before you begin

You must be a Cloud PC Administrator in the partner tenant.

## Reprovision a Windows 365 Cloud PC

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Devices** > **Windows 365**.

2. Select the **All Cloud PCs** tab.

3. From the **Filters** dropdown list, select license type.

4. From the filtered list, select a device.

5. In the device details pane, select **Reprovision**.

6. In the confirmation dialog, select **Reprovision**.

> [!NOTE]
> The current user of the Cloud PC is immediately signed out and all user data is removed.

## Check the device action status

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Devices** > **Windows 365**.

2. Select the **All Cloud PCs** tab.

3. From the list of devices, select a device.

4. In the device details pane, select the **Device action status** tab.

The tab displays any current actions queued for this device, including the action type, status, and timestamp.
