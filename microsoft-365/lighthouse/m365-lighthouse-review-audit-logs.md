# Review audit logs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse audit logs record actions that generate a change in Lighthouse or other Microsoft 365 services. Create, edit, delete, assign, and remote actions all create audit events that you can review. By default, auditing is enabled for all customers. It can't be disabled.

## Before you begin

To view audit logs, you must hold one of the following roles:

- Microsoft Entra Global Administrator in your partner tenant

- Partner Center Admin agent
 
> [!CAUTION]
> To help keep your organization secure, Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the minimum level of permissions needed to perform a job. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to scenarios where you can't use a less-privileged role.

## Review audit logs

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Audit logs**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take up to an hour to see new logs. Go to the respective service to see the most recent changes.

2. Select one of the following tabs to view specific logs: **Audit logs**, **Graph logs**, **Directory logs**, **Sign-in logs**.

2. Filter the logs, as needed, by using the following options:
    - Audit logs tab
        - **Tenants** - Tenant tags or customer tenant names.
        - **Time range** - Last day, last 7 days, last 30 days.
        - **Activity** - Microsoft 365 activity type that corresponds to the action taken. For more information, see the [Activities](#activities) table.

        - **Time range** - Last day, last 7 days, last 30 days.
        - **Is interactive** - Yes (by a user), No (by a client app or OS components on behalf of a user)
        - **Risk state** - None, Confirmed safe, Remediated, Confirmed compromised, Dismissed, At risk
        - **Risk level during sign-in** - Risk level of the sign-in session (likelihood that the sign-in is compromised)
