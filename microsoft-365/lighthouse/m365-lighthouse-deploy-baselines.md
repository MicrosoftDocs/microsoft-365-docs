# Deploy Microsoft 365 Lighthouse baselines

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you deploy standard managed-tenant configurations to secure users, devices, and data within customer tenants. There are seven [default baseline configurations](m365-lighthouse-deploy-standard-tenant-configurations-overview.md) that come standard with Lighthouse. Using the Lighthouse deployment plan feature, you can view, test, and deploy security configurations across all your tenants. A deployment plan is only available to active tenants. Once a tenant is onboarded, you can compare your customers' current configuration against the default baseline configuration and take the appropriate actions.

## Before you begin

Make sure you and your customer tenants meet the requirements listed in [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

## View a deployment plan

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Tenants**.

2. From the tenant list, select the tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

    The Deployment Plan tab provides a searchable and exportable list of each deployment step that is included in the tenant's deployment plan that includes the following information for each deployment step:

    | Column            | Description |
    |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Deployment step | Description of deployment step.                                                     |
    | Status          | The status of the deployment step.                                                  |
    | Baseline        | The baseline from which the deployment step is derived.                             |
    | Category        | Whether the deployment step is associated with managing Devices, Identity, or Data. |
    | Last updated    | The date at which the deployment step was last updated.                             |

4. From the list, select a deployment step you want to review.

    The Deployment Step page provides the following information:

    | Column            | Description |
    |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Summary        | A summary of the Deployment Step's purpose.                                         |
    | Baseline       | The baseline from which the deployment step is derived.                             |
    | Category       | Whether the deployment step is associated with managing Devices, Identity, or Data. |
    | Required SKU   | SKUs required to complete the deployment step.                                      |
    | User impact    | The impact of deploying the step to the tenant's users.                             |
    | For your users | Links to resources the tenant's users may find helpful.                             |
    | Next steps     | Links and guidance around any applicable next steps.                                |

    Deployment steps include one or more processes that need to be completed. The Deployment Step page includes a table that lists each process included in the deployment step and provides the following information:

    | Column            | Description |
    |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Process name      | The name of the process, which, when selected, will open the applicable Process tab.          |
    | Status            | Detected status of these setting configurations included in the deployment process.           |
    | Management portal | The portal through which the configurations settings associated with the process are managed. |

## Deploy a deployment step

1. In the left navigation page, select **Tenants**.

2. From the tenant list, select the tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

4. From the Deployment Step list, select a deployment step you want to deploy.

5. Select **Review and deploy**.

6. From the **Confirm Configurations** pane, select **Deploy**.

## Test a deployment step

For deployment steps deployed through Conditional Access policies, you can compare the configuration settings in the deployment step with settings in any existing policies without deploying the settings to the tenant.

1. In the left navigation page, select **Tenants**.

2. From the tenant list, select the tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

4. From the Deployment Step list, select a deployment step you want to deploy.

5. Select **Review and deploy**.

6. From the **Confirm Configurations** pane, select **Test these settings without a deployment**.

7. Select **Test**.

The Confirm Configurations pane will close and display the policy comparison. Each policy within the existing tenant will be listed in the Detected settings table.

The Detected settings table lists each existing policy and summarizes the number of settings and, in parentheses, the number of users that are in one of the following statuses:

| Status         | Description
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equal settings       | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan with an equivalent value in the tenant.      |
| Missing settings     | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan that are missing a value in the tenant.      |
| Conflicting settings | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan that have a conflicting value in the tenant. |

Detected settings can also be viewed in a modular table that provides configuration setting details for each policy at the setting and user level and can be sorted by each of the following settings statuses:

| Status         | Description
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total settings       | Total number of configuration settings that are included in the deployment process.                        |
| Equal settings       | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan with an equivalent value in the tenant.      |
| Missing settings     | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan that are missing a value in the tenant.      |
| Conflicting settings | Total number of configuration settings in the deployment plan that have a conflicting value in the tenant. |
| Extra settings       | Total number of configuration settings with a value in the tenant but no value in the deployment plan.     |

When this comparison is made, Lighthouse will automatically update the Detected status, Deployment status, and Deployment Step status.

If there are no existing policies to compare, select Review and deploy to reopen the Confirm configurations pane and select Deploy.

If there are existing policies with which to compare, you can either:

- Edit the configuration settings of the deployment plan and retest them against the existing policies, select **Review and deploy** to reopen the Confirm configurations pane, adjust the desired configuration settings, reselect the checkbox, and select **Test** at the bottom of the pane.

- Edit the existing policies within the applicable management portal to reconcile the differences by either:
  - Applying missing settings
  - Editing conflicting settings
  - Deleting existing policies

For each deployment process that can be automated through Lighthouse, there's both a deployment status and a detected status.

- The detected status indicates to what extent the settings in this process are currently deployed.
- The deployment status is the status of the last deployment to the tenant.

Deployment steps can be deployed regardless of existing policies but won't be considered complete until there are no conflicting settings. Failure to resolve these conflicting settings may impact the user experience. 

The deployment of the deployment step in instances when there are equal settings present in the tenant from an existing policy will result in duplication of the existing settings within the tenant but won't impact the user experience. 

Extra settings are provided for your awareness but don't require you to take action.

For more information on policy conflict management, see [Azure AD Conditional Access documentation](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/).

## Update deployment step status

1. In the left navigation page, select **Tenants**.

2. From the tenant list, select the tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

4. From the deployment step list, select a deployment step you want to update.

5. From the **To address** drop-down list, select an action status.

    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | To address                        | The default state of all deployment steps that do NOT include multiple deployment step processes.      |
    | Planned                           | The deployment step has been planned but has yet to be completed.                                      |
    | Risk accepted                     | The user has accepted the risk that would otherwise have been averted by applying the deployment step. |
    | Risk Resolved Through Third Party | The risk has been resolved by the implementation of a third-party application or software.             |
    | Resolved through alternate means  | The risk has been resolved through alternate means, such as the implementation of an internal tool.    |
    | Manual configuration applied      | The configuration prescribed in the deployment plan has been manually applied.                         |

## Share deployment step

1. In the left navigation page, select **Tenants**.

2. From the tenant list, select the tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

4. From the Deployment Step list, select a deployment step you want to share.

5. From the **Share** drop-down list, select one of the following options.

    | Option  | Description |
