# What's new in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

We're continuously adding new features to [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview.md), fixing issues we learn about, and making changes based on your feedback. Review this article to discover what we've been working on.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features get rolled out at different speeds to our customers. If you aren't seeing a feature yet, you should see it soon.

## April 2022

### Delegated access type and roles on Tenants page

We've updated the **Tenants** page to list the Managed Service Provider (MSP)'s delegated access type (None, DAP, GDAP, or Both DAP & GDAP) per customer under the **Delegated access** column. We've also added a new column titled **Your roles** that lists the DAP and GDAP roles per customer for a signed-in user. These two enhancements to the **Tenants** page will make it easier for partner technicians to understand which types of delegated administrative permissions are available for each customer and which delegated roles have explicitly been granted to them.

To learn more, see [Overview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview-of-permissions.md).

## March 2022

### Windows 365 Business integration and management actions

Based on user feedback, we've integrated Windows 365 Business into Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. This will help you manage and monitor all of your customers' Cloud PCs from a single location. 

In addition to integrating with Windows 365 Business Cloud PCs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, you can now take the following management actions:

- Restart
- Reprovision
- Rename
 
To learn more about the new features, see [Overview of the Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview.md).

### Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partner amendment

Now that Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is in General Availability, we require our current partners to sign an updated Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partner amendment. All Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partners who signed up during the preview period will be prompted to complete this new agreement in the coming weeks. Completion will require Global Administrator rights in the partner tenant and must be completed within 90 days to continue accessing the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal.

## February 2022

### Granular Delegated Access Permissions (GDAP) roles

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse now includes the capability for MSPs to use Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP) roles. With the latest update, MSPs can leverage GDAP roles for their technicians that enable the principle of least privilege access in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. This capability reduces the risks inherent in the broad permissions of the Delegated Access Permissions (DAP) role of the Admin Agent by enabling granular controls on the customers' data and settings that each technician will be able to work with.

To learn more about GDAP in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Configure Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal security](m365-lighthouse-configure-portal-security.md).

### Capability to notify users to act on non-compliant devices

As part of the device compliance baseline step, we've added the capability to notify users in a customer tenant to act on non-compliant devices. With this change, once you apply the device compliance deployment step for any customer tenant, the device compliance policy created in that tenant will automatically send a notification to users when their device becomes non-compliant reminding them to take appropriate action to bring the device back into compliance.

### Deployment validation and reporting

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse can now test tenant configurations for deployment steps with Conditional Access policies.  

This new functionality detects existing policies within the customer tenants that you manage and compares them to your deployment plan. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse then provides status designations for deployment steps and deployment step processes to help you understand which deployment processes have already been completed, which ones need to be addressed, and where the settings prescribed by the deployment plan are equal to, missing from, or in conflict with the settings included in the existing policies. Knowing this information makes identifying, prioritizing, and resolving policy conflicts faster, easier, and more effective.

### Deployment step to configure Microsoft Defender Firewall

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse has added the Configure Microsoft Defender Firewall deployment step to its default baseline. This step helps MSPs secure customer tenant devices through the default firewall configuration for Windows 10 (and later) devices. Microsoft Defender Firewall blocks unauthorized network traffic flowing into or out of customer tenant devices and reduces the risk of network security threats. A Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules feature is currently under development.

Microsoft Defender Firewall is turned on by default on Windows 10 (and later) devices. If your customer tenant doesn't have this configured, follow these steps:

1. On the **Tenants** page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, select the customer tenant to open the tenant's **Overview** page.
2. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.
3. From the list of deployment steps, select **Configure Microsoft Defender Firewall**.
4. Select **Review and deploy** to deploy this configuration to the customer tenant. 

### Increase in maximum license limit

We're making it possible to manage more of your customers in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse by increasing the maximum license limit for customer onboarding. Customers with up to 1000 user licenses can now be onboarded to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. We'll continue to evaluate this requirement in future Microsoft 365 Lighthouse releases.

For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

### Support for advisor customers

We've changed our onboarding requirements to allow existing customer tenants with advisor relationships to be onboarded to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Customers with both reseller and advisor contracts are now eligible to be in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse if they meet the requirements for delegated access permissions, have the required licenses, and don't exceed the maximum user count.

For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

## January 2022

### Capability to view audit logs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse now includes the capability to view audit logs. You can review past actions to find misconfigurations and risky actions for remediation, support process and security investigation, train employees, and meet compliance and auditing requirements. With the latest update, you can:

- View audit logs to see all actions taken inside Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, including what changed in which customer tenant, when it was changed, and who changed it.
- Search and filter audit logs to find specific information.
- Export logs so you can analyze and retain them.
 
In the left navigation pane of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, select **Audit logs**. Or, [go directly to the Audit logs page now](https://lighthouse.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_Intune_MTM/Audit.ReactView) to check it out.

## November 2021

### Microsoft 365 services usage data

You can now view usage data for Microsoft 365 services from within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Understanding how customers use their Microsoft 365 services is critical to helping them get the most out of their IT investments. Instead of using multiple resources to view information across your customers' various productivity, security, and compliance services, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse aggregates them into one simple, powerful view.  

These insights can help inform your customer engagements and deliver more value to your customers by empowering you to help them understand which services their users actively use and where there may be opportunities to enhance their security or productivity. 

For more information, see [Overview of the Tenants page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse: Microsoft 365 usage card](m365-lighthouse-tenants-page-overview.md#microsoft-365-usage-card).

### Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft 365 Defender for Office 365 default baseline step

We've added a new step to the default baseline to include guidance for enabling Security Policies for Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO). EOP and MDO help protect users from spam, phishing, and malware emails by sending the emails to the user's quarantine or junk mail folder (coming soon). The deployment plan guides you in setting up EOP and MDO, further expanding your security stance during your next customer tenant deployment plan review.

### Default tenant tags

You can now designate certain tenant tags as *default* from the **Manage tags** pane on the **Tenants** page, so the next time you sign in to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, all your views and insights will be filtered by default to show only the tenants that have a default tag. Default tags can help you focus on insights for high-priority customer tenants.

## October 2021

### Capability to filter by multiple tenant tags

It's now possible to filter data by multiple tenant tags at the same time. This functionality can help you more easily filter the existing views and insights that are available in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse to show relevant customer tenants.

### Capability to assign baseline configurations to specific Azure Active Directory groups

We've added the capability to assign baseline configurations to specific Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups of your customer tenants from within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. From any deployment step page, browse and select the specific Azure AD groups that you want to include or exclude, and then deploy the configurations to your customer tenant.

### Improvements to Risky users page

You can now easily view and understand the reasons for a user's risk from within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. In the left navigation pane of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, select **Users**, and then select the **Risky users** tab. Select **View risk detections** in the **Details** column for any user. From here, you can review the details of the risk and then select **Confirm user compromised** or **Dismiss user risk**. You can also confirm or dismiss a risk for multiple users at the same time from the **Risky users** page. The ability to dismiss a user's risk can be useful when password reset isn't an option or if you believe the affected user is no longer at risk.

### Capability to provide feedback on Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Your feedback matters and is important to us, so we've added new feedback functionality that will occasionally (no more than once a month) prompt you to provide feedback. You can also provide feedback at any time by selecting the feedback icon in the upper-right corner of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.

## September 2021

### Tenant filter changes

We've made some changes to the tenant filtering experience to help you quickly view and manage tenants and tags from any page within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Select the **Tenants** filter at the top of any page and then browse or enter the tenant or tag name that you want to filter by.

## August 2021

### In-product email workflows to communicate with users 

We've made it easier to communicate with users in your customer tenants about actions they're required to take. From the list of users not registered for multifactor authentication (MFA) or self-service password reset, you can now select one or more users and send them an email message using a downloadable email template.

### Capability to take action on noncompliant devices

We've introduced the capability to sync or restart one or more devices across multiple customer tenants. This functionality helps ensure that your customers' devices are protected from risk. To check out this functionality, select **Devices** from the left navigation pane in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, and then select the **Devices** tab. Look for the **Sync** and **Restart** options above the devices list. You can also access these options from the device details pane of any device.

### Capability to monitor and manage Windows 365 Cloud PCs

We've added the capability to monitor on-premises connections and provision and manage Windows 365 Cloud PCs across all of your customer tenants. The new **Windows 365** page provides detailed information about all of your tenants' Cloud PCs in one convenient location. 

### Support for Microsoft 365 E3 customers

We've changed our onboarding requirements to allow you to onboard Microsoft 365 E3 customers to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. To qualify to be managed in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, each customer must meet the following requirements:

- Must have delegated access set up for the MSP to be able to manage the customer tenant
- Must have at least one Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3 license
- Must have no more than 500 licensed users

For more information about requirements, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

## June 2021

### Capability to add custom tags to customer tenants

You can now create and apply custom tags to the customer tenants that you manage in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Use these tags to help you organize your tenants, or use them to more easily filter your tenant list to show insights for relevant sets of customer tenants. 

### Baselines to standardize your customer tenant deployments

With the new baselines feature, you can now deploy standard configurations to help secure users, devices, and data in customer tenants. The default baseline currently contains the following deployment steps (with more coming soon): 

- Require MFA for admins 
- Require MFA for users 
- Block Legacy Authentication 
- Enroll Windows Devices in Microsoft Endpoint Manager – Azure AD Join 
- Configure Defender AV policy for Windows devices 
- Configure Compliance Policy for Windows devices 

To act on these deployment steps, select **Tenants** from the left navigation pane in Microsoft 365 lighthouse, select a tenant from the tenants list, and then select the **Deployment plan** tab. 

## May 2021

### Enhancements to Tenants page

We've made the following enhancements to the **Tenants** page:

- Added a list of total counts by issue to the top of the page 
- Provided the capability to hover over a status in the **Status** column of the tenants list to see restriction details 
- Improved the status labels
