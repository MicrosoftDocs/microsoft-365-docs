# Deploy a task automatically in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you deploy configurations associated with eligible deployment tasks automatically. This capability helps ensure that the tenants you manage are healthy and secure.

## Before you begin

Make sure you and your customer tenants meet the requirements listed in [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

Additionally, each partner tenant user must meet the following requirements:

- The partner tenant user must have DAP/GDAP access to the applicable tenant.

  - For DAP, the partner tenant user must be a member of the admin agent group.

  - For GDAP, the partner tenant user must be a member of a security group that has been granted GDAP permissions to the applicable workload associated with the task.

- The partner tenant user must enable MFA for their user account in the partner tenant.

## Deploy a task automatically

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Tenants**.

2. From the list of tenants, select a tenant you want to view.

3. Select the **Deployment Plan** tab.

4. Select a task from the list.

5. In the task details pane, select **Deploy**.

6. On the **Review deployment task** page, edit the default configuration as needed.

   1. If applicable, select whether to deploy the configuration as **Enable** or **Report Only** mode.

   2. If applicable, edit the assignment of the task to:

      1. Include or exclude specific users.

      2. Include or exclude security groups.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Tasks implemented by a conditional access policy deployment include a drop-down menu to select the deployment state. Tasks are set to the deployment state of **Enabled** by default but can be manually adjusted to **Report Only** via the drop-down menu. Tasks deployed as **Enabled** will immediately impact user experience. Settings from configurations deployed in a **Report only** state will continue to be reported as **Not compliant** in Lighthouse until the deployment state of the applicable configuration is updated to **Enabled**.

7. Select **Next**.

8. On the **Review tenant configuration** page, review intersecting configurations. Intersecting configurations are common properties with settings that are also included in the deployment task.

   The **Review tenant configurations** page is provided for eligible tasks and lists any intersecting configurations detected within the tenant. From this page, you may edit the existing configurations or deploy a new configuration through Lighthouse to fulfill the task's requirements.

   If existing configurations are detected, they'll be displayed with a link to the applicable configuration in the **Detected configuration in the deployment plan** comparison table.

   The detected configurations table at the bottom of the page allows you to compare the detected configurations from the tenant to your deployment plan, inclusive of any selections made on the **Review deployment task** page. This table can be filtered by configuration or setting status and searched by user.

   If there are no detected configurations, you'll be directed to the **Confirm configuration** page.

9. If applicable, edit existing configurations as needed.

   1. Open the appropriate management portal.

   2. Navigate to the appropriate configuration.

   3. Edit the configuration as required by the task.

   4. Save the updated configuration in the applicable management portal

   5. In Lighthouse, select **Refresh** to refresh the results of the detected configuration.

   When editing existing configurations, **Extra** settings have no impact on the deployment status of the task. You may retain, edit, or discard **Extra** settings at your discretion.

    Once Lighthouse determines there are no settings that are **Not compliant** or **Missing** from all existing configurations, Lighthouse will update the task status to **Compliant**. You will be prompted to exit the wizard.

10. Select **Next**.

11. On the **Confirm configuration** page, confirm the configuration and select **Confirm**.

12. On the **Complete** confirmation page, select **Close**.

Deploying a new configuration through Lighthouse will ensure that the security configuration is enforced but doesn't modify any existing configurations. This may result in settings with duplicate or conflicting values for users, which may prevent the status of the task from being updated to **Compliant**. To make the task compliant, you'll need to edit or delete the settings that aren't compliant with the deployment task.
