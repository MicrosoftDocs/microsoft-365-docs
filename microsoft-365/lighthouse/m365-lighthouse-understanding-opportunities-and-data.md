# Understand opportunities and data in Sales Advisor in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Sales Advisor focuses on producing recommendations that help drive the conversations partners have with customers throughout the customer lifecycle. It uses machine learning (ML) models to provide recommended actions and the reasoning behind each recommendation. The data used in the models combine insights about the customer, the current subscriptions, and the usage and engagement of each product.

The current machine learning models recommend growth, retention, and acquisition opportunities.

## Opportunities

Opportunities are specific, actionable recommendations generated by Sales Advisor. Each opportunity contains a recommendation for a particular customer, insights, suggested actions, resources, subscriptions, and usage data to guide you. Each opportunity contains the following data:

- Customer: Name of customer

- Recommendation: Recommended action for this opportunity

- Probability Status: The probability that a prediction is correct. Possible values are High, Medium, or Low.

- Opportunity type: Indicates the general category of opportunities being presented.

  - Customer acquisition

  - Customer retention

  - Customer growth

- Product: Product associated with the opportunity (not visible for Customer retention opportunities)

- Seats: Number of paid licenses in the customer tenant

- Date Added/Created: Date the opportunity was first created for the customer. Recommendations are refreshed regularly to capture the most recent customer signals, so an opportunity will continue to show up if the customer signals remain the same, regardless of when it was first created.

> [!NOTE]
> Each customer can have zero, one, or more opportunities. Only customers with one or more opportunities will be populated into the opportunities table. Within each opportunity type, there will be only up to one opportunity per customer.

## Opportunities page

The Opportunities page displays opportunities across all opportunity types, customer acquisition, customer retention, and customer growth. The Opportunities page summarizes the highest value opportunities within a partner's Microsoft 365 install base. The **All opportunities** tab is divided into three areas:

- **Opportunities overview** - a summary view that contains the number of total customer tenants and the number of opportunities by opportunity type.

- **Prioritized opportunities** - a summary view that breaks down the number of high-propensity opportunities and medium-propensity opportunities by opportunity type.

- **Recommendation table** – contains Customer Tenant, Recommendation, Probability status, Opportunity type, Seats, Date Added, and Provide feedback. By default, the table is sorted to display the newest recommendation first. The recommendation table view displays each opportunity as a separate row.

The **Customer acquisition**, **Customer retention**, and **Customer growth** tabs are a view of the same opportunity data filtered by opportunity category.

The Opportunities page also includes the following options:

- **Export:** Select to export opportunities data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file.

- **Search:** Enter keywords to quickly locate a specific tenant in the list.

## Opportunity Category

There are three categories of opportunities to cover the stages of a customer's lifecycle – customer acquisition, customer retention, and customer growth. These types align with the three tabs on the Opportunities page.

### Customer acquisition

Opportunity type that is designed to accelerate customer acquisition using trials and trial conversion conversations to sell Microsoft 365 more efficiently. Partners can discover opportunities to acquire new users by converting trial subscriptions to paid offerings.

### Customer retention

Opportunity type that is designed to get early warnings where direct engagement can avoid future Microsoft 365 churn to serve better and retain customers. Partners can discover opportunities to increase adoption and mitigate customers' risk of churning.

### Customer growth

Opportunity type that is designed to know which customers are ready for the next step in their digital transformation based on usage patterns and behaviors of similar customers. Partners can discover opportunities to grow your business by upgrading customers to higher-value subscriptions.
