# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

This article provides instructions for how to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. 

## Before you begin

- Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is deployed in the partner tenant only&mdash;not in the customer tenants, but make sure you and your customer tenants meet the requirements listed in [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

- You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant that you're signing in to.

## Steps to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a> and sign in using your partner tenant credentials. 

2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Microsoft 365**.
   
3. Under **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse**, select **Details**. 

4. Select **Buy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Lighthouse requires one license for the partner tenant only. No additional per-user licenses are required for the partner, and no Lighthouse licenses are required in any customer tenant. 

    To verify that Lighthouse was successfully added to your tenant, look for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse under **Billing > Your products** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

5. If you aren't redirected to the Lighthouse portal, go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">https://lighthouse.microsoft.com</a>.

6. Select **Agree & Continue** to complete the partner agreement amendment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you complete sign-up, it can take up to 48 hours for customer data to appear in Lighthouse.
