# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, follow the instructions in this article to sign up.

## Before you begin

- Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is deployed in the partner tenant only&mdash;not in the customer tenants, but make sure you and your customer tenants meet the requirements listed in [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

- You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant you're signing into.

## Steps to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a> and log in using your partner tenant credentials. 

1. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services** > **Other Services**.

    If Microsoft 365 Lighthouse isn't in the services list, select **See all other services products**.

    If you encounter the Purchase services error page, select **View products** at the bottom of the page.

1. Under **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for Partners Public Preview**, select **Details**. 

1. Select **Buy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Lighthouse requires one license for the partner tenant only. No additional per-user licenses are required for the partner, and no Lighthouse licenses are required in any customer tenant. 

    To verify that Lighthouse was successfully added to your tenant, look for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse under **Billing > Your Products** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. If you aren't redirected to the Lighthouse portal, go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">https://lighthouse.microsoft.com</a>.

1. Select **Agree & Continue** to complete the partner agreement amendment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you complete sign-up, it can take up to 48 hours for customer data to appear in Lighthouse.
