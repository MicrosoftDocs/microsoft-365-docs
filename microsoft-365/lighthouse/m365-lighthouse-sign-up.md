# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

This article provides instructions for how to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) grow their business and deliver managed services at scale for small-and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Lighthouse provides multi-tenant views across customer devices, data, users, and sales opportunities to help customers get the most value from Microsoft 365.

## Before you begin

- Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is deployed in the partner tenant only&mdash;not in the customer tenants, but make sure you and your tenants meet the requirements listed in [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

- You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant that you're signing in to.

## Steps to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a> and sign in using your partner tenant credentials. 

2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Microsoft 365**.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > Instead of **Billing**, some partners may need to go to **Marketplace** > **All products**, and then search for **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse**.
   
3. Under **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse**, select **Details**. 

4. Select **Buy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Lighthouse requires one license for the partner tenant only. No additional per-user licenses are required for the partner, and no Lighthouse licenses are required in any customer tenant. 

    To verify that Lighthouse was successfully added to your tenant, look for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse under **Billing** > **Your products** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

5. If you aren't redirected to the Lighthouse portal, go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">https://lighthouse.microsoft.com</a>.

6. Select **Agree & Continue** to complete the partner agreement amendment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you complete sign-up, it can take up to 48 hours for customer data to appear in Lighthouse.

## Next steps

Lighthouse comes with both required and optional capabilities to help you configure Lighthouse portal security. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal security](m365-lighthouse-configure-portal-security.md).

To access the Sales Advisor feature in Lighthouse, you must set up additional roles in Partner Center. For more information, see [Get access to Sales Advisor](m365-lighthouse-get-access-to-sales-advisor.md).
