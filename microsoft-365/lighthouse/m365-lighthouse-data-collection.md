# Data collection for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Data collection is how Microsoft 365 Lighthouse gathers and analyzes information from managed service providers (MSPs) and customers. The Lighthouse service collects data through MSP usage and service-to-service operations for the customers with whom an MSP has a delegated admin relationship. With this data, Lighthouse can provide the MSP with valuable insights and tailored recommendations and enable centralized management from a single experience.

## Data collection for MSPs

Lighthouse collects data from MSPs when a user from the partner tenant uses Lighthouse. This data helps Lighthouse provide and improve its service for the specific MSP and customers involved. This data isn't shared with other parties and is protected by strict privacy and security measures. The MSP has complete control and ownership over their data, and they can view, manage, or delete it at any time.
The data collected from partner tenants is divided into two categories: diagnostic data and usage data.

- **Diagnostic data:** This data captures the performance and reliability of Lighthouse, such as errors, crashes, or failures. Diagnostic data helps identify and resolve issues that affect the service quality or user experience.
- **Usage data:** This data reflects the actions and preferences of the partner when using Lighthouse, such as specifying contacts or websites for customers, creating custom baselines, deploying deployment tasks, or setting up granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) relationships. Usage data helps Lighthouse customize and optimize the service for each MSP based on their input.

Some examples of the diagnostic data that are collected are:

- **Errors:** This data captures errors such as service errors that occur when an MSP uses Lighthouse. Error data helps Lighthouse diagnose and fix any problems that prevent the MSP from using the service properly.
- **Failures:** This data captures failures that occur when a partner uses Lighthouse, such as baseline failures or deployment failures. Failure data helps Lighthouse understand and improve the success rate and quality of the service features and functions.
- **Performance metrics:** This data captures the performance of Lighthouse, such as load time, response time, or throughput. Performance metrics help Lighthouse measure and optimize the speed and efficiency of the service.

Some examples of the usage data that Lighthouse collects when an authorized user from a partner tenant uses the experience are:

- **Creating custom baselines:** When a partner creates a custom baseline in Lighthouse, Lighthouse stores the information and uses it to associate the baseline with one or more customer tenants.
- **Deployment of deployment tasks:** When a partner deploys a deployment task that is part of a baseline in Lighthouse, Lighthouse stores this information and uses it to track the progress and status of the deployment task. This information is also used to report any errors or failures that occur during the deployment process.
- **Specifying contacts or websites for customers:** When a partner specifies a contact or a website for a customer in Lighthouse, Lighthouse stores this information and uses it to display the customer details in the dashboard.
- **GDAP relationships setup:** When a partner sets up a GDAP relationship with a customer tenant in Lighthouse, Lighthouse stores the information and uses it to configure and manage the GDAP relationship. This information is also used to verify the consent and authorization of the customer when accessing their data.
This information isn't shared with other parties, and is protected by strict privacy and security measures.

## Data collection for MSP customers

Lighthouse collects data from customer tenants through a service plan that enables it to access the customer's data with their consent. The MSP must also have delegated access to the customer's tenant delegate admin relationship.

The data collected from customer tenants helps Lighthouse provide better security and performance for those tenants. For example, by collecting device information, Lighthouse can help the MSP identify and resolve issues affecting the customer's devices, such as malware infections, hardware failures, or software updates. Microsoft respects the privacy and security of the data collected from customer tenants. Lighthouse uses encryption, access control, auditing, and retention policies to protect the data from unauthorized or inappropriate use or disclosure.

The following table summarizes the types of data that Lighthouse collects from customer tenants, where it collects it from, what scope it covers, and what purpose it serves.

## Data not collected

Lighthouse empowers MSPs to grow, manage, and secure their Microsoft 365 customers more effectively and efficiently. To do this, Lighthouse collects data only for specific purposes, such as enhancing the service reliability, maintainability, and scalability of Microsoft 365 applications and services. Microsoft also complies with strict standards for handling the data securely and responsibly.

Lighthouse will never collect data that isn't necessary or relevant to its service. Lighthouse won't do anything to compromise the security or integrity of its MSPs and customers. Following are examples of data that Lighthouse will never collect:

- **Biometric data:** Data that identifies or verifies the identity of MSPs and customers based on their physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris scans.
- **Content of emails, messages, and documents:** Data that MSPs and customers create, send, receive, or store in their email, chat, or document applications.
- **Credentials, passwords, or keys:** Data that MSPs and customers use to access their accounts, devices, or applications.
- **Data from inactive customer tenants:** Management data from customer tenants that have been inactivated in Lighthouse by the MSP.
- **Data from inactive delegated admin relationships:** Data from customer tenants where the MSP doesn't have an active delegated admin relationship.
- **Location data:** Data that reveals the physical or geographical location of MSPs and customers, such as GPS coordinates, IP addresses, or Wi-Fi networks.
- **Personal or financial information:** Data that partners and customers may have in their profiles, preferences, transactions, or records.
Lighthouse ensures that it collects only necessary and relevant data for its service and protects the privacy and confidentiality of its MSPs and customers.
