# Get help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse 

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md).

Several options are available if you need help. Start by checking the current health of customer tenant services:

1. In the left navigation pane of Lighthouse, select **Service health**.
2. View detailed information about current and past issues.

To check the current health of the Lighthouse tenant services:

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Health** > **Service health**.
3. In the list of services, find **Microsoft 365 suite**, and then expand it to show all the services in the suite.
4. Find **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse** and check the health.

If you're experiencing an issue that isn't listed in either of the Service health dashboards, follow the instructions in this article to view self-help options or to create a service request.

> [!NOTE]
> Support is limited to English while Lighthouse is in Preview.

## Before you begin

- To create and manage service requests, you must have at least one Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role assigned to you with the following property set: **microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks**. For a list of Azure AD roles, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). For information on how to assign roles, see [Assign Azure AD roles to users](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

- If you need to create a service request, gather as many details as possible about your issue, such as diagnostic logs, tenant ID, and user IDs (if specific users are affected).

## Access help and support

1.  In Lighthouse, select the **?** icon at the top of the portal to open the **Help** pane, and then do one of the following:
    
    -  If you're on the page of the portal where the issue occurred, select **Show diagnostics**.

        This will create a JSON file with information to help Support agents troubleshoot your issue. Save the file so you can attach it to your service request.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The JSON file will contain personally identifiable information.

    -  If your issue isn't isolated to the current page of the portal, go to the next step.

2.  In the **Help** pane, select the **Help + support** button. This opens the **How can we help?** pane.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **How can we help?** pane doesn't open, you'll need to reach out to someone in your partner tenant who has Global Administrator permissions and ask them to help.

3.  In the **How can we help?** pane, enter a description of your issue, and then press **Enter**. We recommend including the full product name *Microsoft 365 Lighthouse* in your description to ensure the search results include relevant help articles.

4.  Check out the list of recommended articles to see if any of them help resolve your issue.

    If you enter a description of your issue and it doesn't return a list of help articles, rephrase your description and try another search.

5.  If the recommended articles don't help, select **Contact Support**.

6.  Fill out the information in the form, attach any screenshots and the JSON file that you saved in step&nbsp;1 if applicable, and then select **Contact me**. The expected wait time is indicated in the pane.
