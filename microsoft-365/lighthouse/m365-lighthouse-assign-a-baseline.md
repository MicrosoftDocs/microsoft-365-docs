# Assign a baseline in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

By default, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse assigns the default baseline to all tenants. You can create and assign a baseline to accommodate varying customer requirements.

## Before you begin

Make sure you and your customer tenants meet the requirements listed in [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

Additionally, each partner tenant user must be a Microsoft 365 Lighthouse admin.

## Assign a baseline to a tenant

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Tenants**.
2. Select a tenant to which you want to assign a new baseline.
3. Select **Assign baseline**.
4. Select the baseline you want to assign to the selected tenants.

> [!NOTE]
> Baselines do not include tenant-specific attributes, and the assignment of a new baseline will overwrite any pre-existing customization to the configuration of a tenant’s deployment plan, such as deployment task dismissals, user and user group exclusions, and deployment statuses of manual deployment tasks. These values will need to be re-entered for each tenant, as needed.

## Next steps

Once the baseline is assigned, Lighthouse queries the assigned tenants to detect and report their deployment status. [Review the deployment plan](m365-lighthouse-review-deployment-plan.md) to determine the next steps in the deployment process.
