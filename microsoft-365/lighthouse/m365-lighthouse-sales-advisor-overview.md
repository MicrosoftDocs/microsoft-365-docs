# Overview of Sales Advisor in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Sales Advisor is a customer lifecycle management (CLM) experience that provides AI-driven customer insights, actionable recommendations, and prescriptive guidance across the customer lifecycle. Sales Advisor is based on a set of business rules, customer usage, and licensing positions. It enables a technique called "propensity modeling" to present dynamic opportunities for partners to better acquire, retain, and grow their customers.

To view Sales Advisor, select **Sales Advisor \> Opportunities** in the left navigation pane in Lighthouse.

**IMPORTANT:** To use Sales Advisor, users must have the appropriate roles listed in [Get access to Sales Advisor](m365-lighthouse-get-access-to-sales-advisor.md).
