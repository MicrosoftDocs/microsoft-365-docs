# View an enterprise Cloud PC failed network connection in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides the connection status between your customer tenants and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When a Cloud PC has a failed network connection, you can view detailed information in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant.
- You must have Cloud PC Administrator or Cloud PC Reader access to view connection issues.

## View a failed network connection

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Devices** > **Windows 365**.

2. Select the **Azure network connections** tab.

3. From the colored count-annotation bar, select **Failed connections**.

4. From the filtered list, select **View connection details in Microsoft Endpoint Manager** next to the connection you want to investigate.

5. From the Microsoft Intune admin center, select **View details** to learn more about the error.

## Next steps
