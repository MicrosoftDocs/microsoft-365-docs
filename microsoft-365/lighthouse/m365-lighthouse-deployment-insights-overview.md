# Understanding deployment insights in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides deployment insights within and across the tenants you manage. Deployment insights are derived from a combination of signals that are either detected by Lighthouse or entered into Lighthouse by a user in the partner tenant. Deployment insights help you:

- Understand the deployment status across all customer tenants, users, and tasks.

- Review deployment exceptions such as **Dismissed** tasks and **Excluded** users.

- Review regressions such as tasks that change from a **Compliant** or **Dismissed** status to a status of **Not compliant** or **Not licensed**.

- Quantify threats based on user- and task-level deployment progress.

- Prioritize deployment activities based on risk.

To access deployment insights, in the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Deployment \> Deployment insights**.

## Deployment insights page
The **Deployment insights** page includes the following:

- Tenant progress
- User progress
- Deployment insights based on customer tenants and tasks

> [!NOTE]
> The **Deployment insights** page measures deployment progress across all customer tenants that have an onboarding status of **Active**. By default, the deployment insights are filtered to display insights for all tenants but can be filtered by tenant tag.

### Tenant progress

The tenant progress graph measures deployment progress by customer tenant, reporting the status of each tenants' deployment plan as one of the following:

- **Complete** – The status of all deployment tasks is **Compliant** or **Dismissed**.

- **Not complete** – The status of one or more of the deployment tasks is **Not compliant** or **Not licensed**.

### User progress

The user progress graph measures deployment progress by user, reporting deployment progress status as one of the following:

- **Complete** – The status of all deployment tasks is **Compliant**, **Excluded**, or **Not targeted**.

- **Not complete** – The status of one or more of the deployment tasks is either **Not compliant** or **Not licensed**.

### Deployment insights table

The deployment insights table organizes information by customer tenant and task.

The data on the **Tenants** tab can be filtered by deployment plan status and baseline. It provides the following information for each customer tenant:

| **Column**  | **Description**                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Tenant                 | The name of the customer tenant.                      |
| Baseline               | The baseline that's assigned to the customer tenant.    |
| Deployment plan status | The status of the deployment plan&mdash;either **Complete** or **Not complete**.   |
| Task progress          | The number of total tasks that are in a state of completion&mdash;either **Compliant** or **Dismissed**.    |
| Dismissed tasks        | The number of tasks that have been **Dismissed**.   |
| Not licensed tasks     | The number of tasks for which the customer tenant is **Not licensed**.      |
| Regressed tasks        | The number of tasks that have regressed from a state of completion (either **Compliant** or **Dismissed**) to a state of either **Not compliant** or **Not licensed**. |
| User progress          | The number of users for which all deployment tasks are **Compliant**, **Excluded**, or **Not targeted**. |
| Excluded users         | The number of users that have a status of **Excluded** for one or more deployment tasks.   |
| Exclusions             | The number of instances of a user having a status of **Excluded** across all deployment tasks.   |

To better understand deployment insights, here are a few examples of how different tenant configurations and deployment activities are reflected in the deployment insights table.

In this example, all customer tenants have 100 users and have been assigned a baseline that includes 10 tasks:

- A – Complete, with no tasks that have been **Dismissed** and no users that have been **Excluded**
- B – Complete, with one task that has been **Dismissed**
- C – Complete, with 1 user **Excluded** from 1 task
- D – Complete, with 1 user **Excluded** from 5 tasks
- E – Complete, with 5 users **Excluded** from 1 task
- F – Complete, with 50 users **Excluded** from 5 tasks
- G – Complete, with 100 users **Excluded** from 10 tasks
- H – Not complete, with 1 user that is **Not compliant** for 1 task
- I – Not complete, with 1 task for which 100 users are **Not compliant**
- J – Not complete, with 1 task that has regressed to a state of **Not licensed**
- K – Not complete, with 1 newly detected user with a status of **Not Licensed** for all tasks
- L – Not complete, with 1 user with from which all licenses have been unassigned
