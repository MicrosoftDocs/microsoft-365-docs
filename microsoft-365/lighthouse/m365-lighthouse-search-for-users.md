# Search for users in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you search for a specific user across all active tenants. This allows you to find a user quickly without needing to navigate different tenants.

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users** > **Account management** > **Search users**.

2. In the search box, enter a display name or user principal name (UPN).

3. From the search results list, select the user you want to research.

## Next steps

Once the user is found, you can reset their password or block their account. For more information, see [Reset user password](m365-lighthouse-reset-user-password.md) or [Block user sign-in in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-block-user-signin.md).
