# Block user sign-in

You can block a user account if you think it's compromised. When you block a user account, it immediately blocks anyone from signing in to that account. If a user tries to sign in, they're automatically signed out of all Microsoft 365 services within 60 minutes. Blocking a user account won't delete any data, and it won't stop the account from receiving mail.

## Block sign-in for a user

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Search users** tab.

3. In the search box, enter a user's name.

4. From the search results list, select the user.

5. In the user details pane, select **Block sign-in**.

6. In the Manage sign-in status pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

7. Select **Save**.

## Block sign-in for risky users

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Risky users** tab.

3. Select a risky user from the list.

4. In the user details pane, select **Block sign-in**.

5. In the Manage sign-in status pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

6. Select **Save**.
