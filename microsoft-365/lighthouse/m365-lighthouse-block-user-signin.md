# Block user sign-in

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md).

You can block a user account if you think it is compromised. When you block someone, it immediately blocks anyone from signing into that account. If they’re signed in, they will be automatically signed out from all Microsoft services within 60 minutes. This won’t stop the account from receiving mail and doesn’t delete any data.

## Block sign-in for a user

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Search users** tab.

3. In the search box, enter a user’s name.

4. From the search results list, select the user.

5. In the user details pane, select **Block sign-in**.

6. In the Manage sign-in status pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

7. Select **Save**.

## Block risky users

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Risky users** tab.

3. Select risky user from the list.

4. In the user details pane, select **Block sign-in**.

5. In the Manage sign-in status pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

6. Select **Save**.
