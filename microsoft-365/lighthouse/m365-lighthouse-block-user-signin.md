# Block user sign-in in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

You can block a user account if you think it's compromised. When you block a user account, it immediately blocks anyone from signing in to that account. If a user tries to sign in, they're automatically signed out of all Microsoft 365 services within 60 minutes. Blocking a user account won't delete any data, and it won't stop the account from receiving mail.

## Block sign-in for a user

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Users** > **Account management** > **Search users**.

2. On the **Search users** tab, enter a user's name in the search box.

3. From the search results list, select the user.

4. In the user details pane, select **Block sign-in**.

5. In the **Block sign-in** pane, select **Block this user from signing in**.

6. Select **Save changes**.

## Block sign-in for risky users

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Users** > **Risky users**.

2. On the **Risky Users** page, select the set of users you want to take action on.

3. Select **Block sign-in**.

4. In the **Manage sign-in status** pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

5. Select **Save**.
