# Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) grow their business and deliver services to customers at scale from a single portal. With Lighthouse, you can standardize configurations, manage risk, identify artificial intelligence (AI)-driven sales opportunities, and engage with customers in an unprecedented manner, allowing you to anticipate customer needs and maximize their investment in Microsoft 365.

For MSPs with delegated access, Lighthouse simplifies onboarding of customer tenants by recommending security configuration baselines tailored to SMB customers and providing multi-tenant views across all customer environments. With Lighthouse, Service Engineers can scale the management of their customers, focus on what's most important, quickly find and investigate risks, and take action to get their customers to a healthy and secure state.

Lighthouse also provides capabilities for account managers. With AI-driven insights, Lighthouse delivers proactive, actionable, and personalized recommendations to help acquire new customers, improve customer retention, and expand business with premium offers. 

No additional costs are associated with using Lighthouse to manage Microsoft 365 services and connected devices. Lighthouse is available to partners enrolled in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program,  including both Direct-Bill and Indirect Resellers.  

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> To use Lighthouse, MSPs and their customer tenants must meet the requirements listed in [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

For more information about the CSP program, see the [Cloud Solution Provider program overview](/partner-center/csp-overview).

> A similar offering, Azure Lighthouse, helps service providers deliver managed services for Azure services by using comprehensive and robust management tooling built into the Azure platform. To learn more, see [What is Azure Lighthouse?](/azure/lighthouse/overview)
