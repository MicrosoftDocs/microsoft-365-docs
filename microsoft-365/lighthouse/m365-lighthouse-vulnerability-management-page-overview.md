# Overview of the Vulnerability management page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides a multi-tenant view of exposure score and recommendations from Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management in Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The exposure score from Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management reflects how vulnerable tenants are to cybersecurity threats. Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management helps proactively identify and build a secure foundation for devices through the remediation of software vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in customer environments.

To learn more about vulnerability management, see [What is Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management).

You can access the Vulnerability management page in Lighthouse from the **Microsoft Defender for Business exposure score** card on the **Home** page or from the left navigation pane by selecting **Devices** > **Vulnerability management**. You'll see a multi-tenant view of the exposure and vulnerabilities detected for all tenants that have devices onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Business or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Overview tab

The overview tab provides multi-tenant insights into the exposure score, the number of exposed devices, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for tenants to lower their exposure. You can filter the list by exposure score, tenant name, or tenant tag. Select a tenant from the list to be taken to the Vulnerability Management dashboard page for that tenant in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. To export exposure score data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file, select **Export**.
