# Block sign-in for shared mailbox accounts using Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Every shared mailbox has a corresponding user account. A shared mailbox isn't intended for direct sign-in by its associated user account. You should always block sign-in for the shared mailbox account and keep it blocked.

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides visibility into all the shared mailboxes across your managed tenants that are enabled for direct sign-in. You can track and block sign-in for all shared mailbox accounts from the **Shared mailboxes** page.

## Block sign-in for shared mailbox accounts

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Users** > **Account management** > **Shared mailboxes**.

2. On the **Shared mailboxes** tab, select the Shared mailbox account you want to block and then select **Block sign-in**.

3. In the **Manage sign-in status** pane, select **Block users from signing in**.

4. Select **Save**.

## Notify users that access is blocked (optional)

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Users** > **Account management** > **Shared mailboxes**.

2. On the **Shared mailboxes** tab, select the check box next to the accounts you want to notify.

3. From the command bar, select **Create email**.

Lighthouse opens your default email client and prepopulates the email message to notify them login access has been blocked.
