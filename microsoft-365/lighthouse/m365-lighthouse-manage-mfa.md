# Manage multifactor authentication in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) helps safeguard access to data and applications, providing another layer of security by using a second form of authentication. The Multifactor Authentication tab provides detailed information on the status of MFA enablement across your tenants. Select any tenant in the list to see more details for that tenant, including which Conditional Access policies requiring MFA are already configured and which users have not yet registered for MFA.

For small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers, Microsoft recommends enabling [security defaults](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) at a minimum. For more complex scenarios, you can use [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) to configure specific policies.

## Before you begin

The following conditions must be met before a tenant will appear in the list:

- The customer tenant must have an Azure AD Premium license for each user. For more information on which licenses support MFA, see [Features and licenses for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-licensing).

- The customer tenant must be active within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. To learn how to determine if a tenant is active, see [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse tenant list overview](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-tenant-list-overview).

## Enable MFA for a tenant

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Multifactor Authentication** tab.

3. From the tenant list, select a tenant to open the details pane.

4. On the **MFA enablement** tab, under **MFA with Security defaults**, select **Enable Security Defaults**.

5. Select **Save changes**.

To enable MFA through Conditional Access, see [Tutorial: Secure user sign-in events with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa).

## Notify users who aren't registered for MFA

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Users**.

2. Select the **Multifactor Authentication** tab.

3. From the tenant list, select a tenant to open the details pane.

4. On the **User not registered for MFA** tab, select the users that you want to notify.

5. Select **Create email**.

Lighthouse opens your default email client and prepopulates the email message with instructions to register for MFA. All the selected users will be included on the BCC line. If you prefer to individually email users, you can select the email icon next to the username.

If you want to use a different email account, you can export the list of users to a file. You can also download sample email templates that you can customize with your company branding.

## Next steps

Once MFA is enabled, you can enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset. This feature gives users the ability to change or reset their password with no administrator or help desk involvement. For more information, see [Manage self-service password reset in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-manage-sspr.md).
