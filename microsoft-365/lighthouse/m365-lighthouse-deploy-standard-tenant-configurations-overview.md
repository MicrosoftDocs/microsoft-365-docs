# Overview of using Microsoft 365 Lighthouse baselines to deploy standard tenant configurations

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse baselines provide a repeatable and scalable way for you to manage Microsoft 365 security settings across multiple customer tenants. Baselines provide standard tenant configurations that deploy core security policies and compliance standards that keep your tenants' users, devices, and data secure and healthy.

To view the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse default baseline that applies to all tenants, select **Deployment > Baselines** in the left navigation pane in Lighthouse.
