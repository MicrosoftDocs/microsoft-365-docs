# Set up GDAP for your customers

You can now set up all your customers with granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) through Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, regardless of their licenses or size. Lighthouse lets you quickly transition your organization to GDAP and begin the journey to least-privilege for your delegated access to customers. By setting up your organization with GDAP for the customer tenants you manage, users in your organization have the permissions necessary to do their work while keeping customer tenants secure.

Delegated access via DAP or GDAP is a prerequisite for customer tenants to be fully onboarded to Lighthouse. Therefore, creating GDAP relationships with your customers may be the first step in managing your customer tenants in Lighthouse.

During the GDAP setup process, you'll assign roles to tiers of job functions for employees in your organization and then create GDAP templates that will assign those tiered roles to specific security groups with users for groups of customers. GDAP roles are scoped to [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference), and when you set up GDAP, you'll see recommendations for a set of roles needed for each tier.

## Before you begin

- You'll need to have specific permissions in the partner tenant:

  - To establish GDAP security groups, add users, and create GDAP templates, you need to be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant. This role can be assigned in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
  - To create and complete GDAP relationships, you must be a member of the Admin Agents group in Partner Center.

- The customers you manage in Lighthouse need to be set up in Partner Center with either a reseller relationship or an existing delegated relationship (DAP or GDAP).

- To enable the JIT Only tier permissions, you'll need an Azure AD P2 license for your partner tenant.

## Set up GDAP for the first time

When you set up GDAP for the first time, you must complete the following sections in order. Once completed, you can come back and edit any section as needed.

To get started:

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Home**.

2. On the **Set up GDAP for your organization** card, select **Begin setup**.

3. Complete the following sections in order.

    [Step 1: Define tiers of permissions](#step-1-define-tiers-of-permissions)

    [Step 2: Create GDAP templates](#step-2-create-gdap-templates)

    [Step 3: Create security groups](#step-3-create-security-groups)

    [Step 4: Assign customer tenants](#step-4-assign-customer-tenants)

    [Step 5: Review settings](#step-5-review-settings)

### Step 1: Define tiers of permissions

Choose the roles needed for each tier based on your employees' job functions.

1. From the **Define tiers of permissions** page, select the roles needed for each tier based on your employees' job functions. Do one of the following:

    - Adopt recommended configurations

    - Manually assign a role to each tier

2. Select **Next** to go to the next section or select **Save and close** to save your settings and exit GDAP Setup.

You can rename tiers to match your organizational needs. You can also remove roles from each tier within the recommendations. Certain roles can't be added to different tiers&mdash;for example, the roles in the JIT Only tier can't be added to any other tier.

### Step 2: Create GDAP templates

A GDAP template is a collection of:

- Tiers with roles

- Security groups per tier

- Users in each security group
 
To create a GDAP template:

1. From the **Create GDAP templates** page, select **Create template**.

2. In the template pane, enter template name and description into the appropriate fields.

3. Select one or more tiers from the list.

4. Select **Save**.

5. Select **Next** to go to the next section or select **Save and close** to save your settings and exit GDAP Setup.

### Step 3: Create security groups

You'll need at least one security group per tier for each template. For the first template, you'll create a new security group, but for subsequent templates, you may reuse groups if desired.

1. From the **Create security groups** page, select **Create security group**.

2. In the security group pane, enter a name and description.

3. Select **Add users**.

4. From the Add users list, select the users you want to include in this security group.

5. Select **Save**.

6. Select **Save** again.

7. Select **Next** to go to the next section or select **Save and close** to save your settings and exit GDAP Setup.

### Step 4: Assign customer tenants

Assign groups of customers to each template. Each customer can only be assigned to one template, so once selected, that customer tenant won't be displayed as an option on subsequent templates.

If you want to reassign a customer tenant, rerun GDAP Setup and remove that customer from the existing assignment. Then you can reassign it to a different template. You can filter the list using the search box in the upper right corner.

1. From the **Assign customer tenants** page, select the tenants you want to associate with the security group you created.

2. Select **Next** to go to the next section or select **Save and close** to save your settings and exit GDAP Setup.

### Step 5: Review settings

1. From the **Review settings** page, review the settings you created, and then select **Finish**.

2. Select **Done**.

If any customer tenants already had a DAP relationship, during the no-consent window, these settings will be automatically applied. For customers without DAP, or if the no consent window has closed, choosing **Finish** will take you to the last page where a consent link is generated for each customer, as needed. Once the customer consents to the GDAP relationship, the rest of the settings will be automatically applied.

Once you've completed GDAP setup, you can navigate to different steps to make any updates or changes to tiers, roles, security groups, or templates. The GDAP relationships will also be visible in Partner Center, and the security groups will be visible in Azure AD as well.
