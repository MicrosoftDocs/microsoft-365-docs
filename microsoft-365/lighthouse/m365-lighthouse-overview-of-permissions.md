# Overview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse permissions are primarily managed by the following:

- Lighthouse role-based access control (RBAC) in the partner tenant
- Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP) in the customer tenant

To use Lighthouse, you need a combination of roles assigned via RBAC and GDAP.

## Managing Lighthouse RBAC permissions in the partner tenant

Lighthouse permissions in the partner tenant are managed by assigning RBAC roles. Each role has a set of permissions that determines which data users can access and change within the partner tenant.  

RBAC roles are managed from the Lighthouse permissions page in Lighthouse. To access the Lighthouse permissions page and manage permissions, you must be a Global Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID. To learn more, see [Manage Lighthouse RBAC permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-manage-lighthouse-rbac-permissions.md).

There's currently only one Lighthouse RBAC role: Lighthouse Account Manager. The following table describes the Lighthouse Account Manager role.

| Lighthouse&nbsp;RBAC&nbsp;role | Description |
|---|---|
| Lighthouse Account Manager | Provides full access to Sales Advisor pages and data across the entire partner tenant. Lighthouse Account Managers can export Sales Advisor data. |

## Lighthouse RBAC roles and capabilities

The following table describes the actions that Lighthouse Account Managers can perform in Lighthouse.

## Managing GDAP in the customer tenant

GDAP gives you a high level of control and flexibility by providing access to customer tenants through [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). Assigning the least-privileged roles by task through GDAP to MSP technicians reduces security risk for both MSPs and customers.  

For more information about setting up a GDAP relationship with a customer tenant in Lighthouse, see [Obtain granular admin permissions to manage a customer's service - Partner Center](/partner-center/gdap-obtain-admin-permissions-to-manage-customer).   

For more information about least-privileged roles by task, see [Least-privileged roles - Partner Center](/partner-center/gdap-least-privileged-roles-by-task) and [Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-by-task).  

For more information about GDAP or Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP) deprecation, see [GDAP frequently asked questions - Partner Center](/partner-center/gdap-faq), [Delegated administration privileges (DAP) FAQ - Partner Center](/partner-center/dap-faq), or search the [Partner Center announcements](/partner-center/announcements/) for dates and timelines.
