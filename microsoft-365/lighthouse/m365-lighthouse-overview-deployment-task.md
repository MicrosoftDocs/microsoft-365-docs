# Overview of deployment tasks in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

A tenant's deployment plan is complete when all tasks are compliant or explicitly dismissed. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse assesses each task based on the following factors:

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|Is the tenant licensed for the required services associated with the task?|<ul><li>Tasks that aren't licensed won't be eligible for deployment.</li><li>Tasks that aren't licensed may be **Dismissed**.</li><li>Once Lighthouse detects that the tenant is licensed for the required services associated with the task, the status will be updated automatically.</li></ul>|
|Is the task related to other tasks?|<ul><li>Tasks related to other tasks must be completed in sequential order.</li><li>Subsequent tasks will be eligible for deployment once the pre-requisite tasks are **Compliant**.</li></ul>|
|Can the configuration associated with the task be deployed through Lighthouse?|<ul><li>Tasks that require configurations that can't be deployed through Lighthouse will require manual implementation.</li><li>Lighthouse can't deploy tasks when it can't detect any existing configuration.</li></ul>|
|Was the task dismissed?|<ul><li>Dismissed tasks aren't eligible for deployment.</li><li>Dismissed tasks can be **Reinstated**.</li><li>Once a task is **Reinstated**, the status will be updated automatically.</li></ul>|
|Is the task compliant?|<ul><li>Compliant tasks require no further action, but users may review task details and existing configurations.</li></ul>|
