    questions:
      - question: What is Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers who are using Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3.  Lighthouse simplifies onboarding of tenants by recommending security configuration baselines tailored to SMBs and providing multi-tenant views across all customer environments. For more information, see [Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview.md).
          
      - question: What's the difference between Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and Azure Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is focused on Microsoft 365 services rather than Azure services. While Azure Lighthouse is built into the Azure portal and allows IT partners to manage multiple tenants for Azure, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is a standalone portal that helps MSPs manage multiple Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3 customer tenants. For more information about Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview.md). For more information about Azure Lighthouse, see [What is Azure Lighthouse?](/azure/lighthouse/overview)
          
      - question: How much does Microsoft 365 Lighthouse cost?
        answer: |
          No additional costs are associated with using the Preview version of Lighthouse to manage Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Microsoft 365 E3 services and connected devices. Lighthouse is currently in Preview and available to MSPs servicing small- to medium-sized businesses and who have a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) relationship with their customers. Note that indirect providers are not currently supported by Lighthouse. For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

      - question: What are the requirements to use Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          For a list of current requirements, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

      - question: In which countries and regions is Microsoft 365 Lighthouse available?
        answer: |
          Lighthouse is available in all countries where Microsoft 365 is available, except China and Palestinian Authority. However, features in Lighthouse such as device management and threat management rely on Microsoft Intune, and user management relies on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Intune and Azure AD may not be available in certain countries and regions. For a complete list of Microsoft 365, Azure AD, and Intune availability, see [International availability](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/international-availability).

          Lighthouse is not available in national clouds.

      - question: How do I sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          To sign up for Lighthouse, you'll need to be registered with the CSP program. We're currently unable to support indirect providers. For instructions on how to sign up, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md). To learn more about the CSP program, see the [Cloud Solution Provider program overview](/partner-center/csp-overview).
          
      - question: I finished signing up, so why don't I see any customer tenant data?
        answer: |
          It can take up to 48 hours for customer tenant data to load within Lighthouse. If it's been more than 48 hours since you completed onboarding, please reach out to our Support team for help. You'll need to let them know when you completed onboarding and provide any relevant screenshots and logs. For more information, see [Get help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-get-help-and-support.md).
          
      - question: Why do I see data for some customer tenants but not others?
        answer: |
          For customer tenant data to show up in Lighthouse, partners must establish Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP) with customers through Partner Center. For more information, see [Request a reseller relationship with a customer in Partner Center](/partner-center/request-a-relationship-with-a-customer). Tenants also must have at least one Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3 subscription and fewer than 500 licensed users in their tenant. For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md) and [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Tenants page overview](m365-lighthouse-tenants-page-overview.md).
          
      - question: What if I don't want to see certain tenants in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          If you don't want to see certain tenants and their data in Lighthouse, you can inactivate those tenants. To inactivate a tenant, follow these steps:
          
          1. Select **Tenants** from the left navigation pane to open the **Tenants** page.
          1. Find the tenant that you want to inactivate, select the three dots next to the tenant name, and then select **Inactivate tenant**.
          1. In the confirmation message that appears, select **Confirm** to inactivate the tenant.
              > [!NOTE]
              > Once you inactivate a tenant, you can't take action on the tenant until inactivation is complete. It may take up to 48 hours for inactivation to complete.
          
          To learn more about tenants, see [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse tenants page overview](m365-lighthouse-tenants-page-overview.md).

      - question: Will Microsoft 365 Lighthouse work if my customer tenants have other subscriptions besides Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3?
        answer: |
          Lighthouse helps you manage customer tenants that have Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 E3 licenses in place for their users. For users in customer tenants who don't have Business Premium or E3 licenses, Lighthouse functionality will be limited. For example, if a user is missing a license that includes Intune, that user's devices, device compliance status, and threats status will be unavailable; and if a user is missing a license that includes Azure AD P1, that user's password and sign-in management will be unavailable. For more information, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

      - question: How do I qualify to manage customer Cloud PCs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          If you meet the requirements to use Lighthouse, then you're qualified to manage customer Cloud PCs in Lighthouse. For a list of current requirements, see [Requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md).

      - question: Where can I purchase Windows 365 (Cloud PC) licenses for my customers?
        answer: |
          You can purchase Windows 365 licenses through all available Microsoft commercial sales channels. One license purchased is equivalent to the purchase of one Cloud PC. Currently, each user can be assigned only one Cloud PC of the same SKU type, but they can be assigned multiple Cloud PCs if they are of different SKU types. To compare Windows 365 plans and pricing, see [Get the Windows 365 Cloud PC thatâ€™s right for you](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365/business/compare-plans-pricing).
          
      - question: How do I get help and support?
        answer: |
          In Lighthouse, select the **?** icon at the top of the portal to open the **Help** pane. From here you can access self-help articles or contact support. For more information about help and support options, see [Get help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-get-help-and-support.md).
          
      - question: Where can I submit feedback and ideas?
        answer: |
          Your feedback matters and is important to us! There are a few different ways for you to submit feedback:

          - Go to the [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Feedback page](https://aka.ms/m365lighthouseuservoice). You can start conversations about Lighthouse and Windows 365 features, post questions for other partners or Microsoft employees, provide feedback and feature ideas, and more.
          - Select the Feedback icon in the upper-right corner of Lighthouse.
          - Respond to the occasional (not more than once a month) pop-up window in Lighthouse that asks you to provide feedback.
