You can easily apply a [retention label](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/retention?view=o365-worldwide#retention-labels) to a document understanding model in Project Cortex.

Retention labels let you apply retention settings to the documents that your document understanding model identify.  For example, you may want your model to not only identify any contract renewal documents that are uploaded to your document library, but to also apply a retention tag to them so that these documents can never be deleted.

You an apply a retention label to your document understanding model through your model settings. 

> [!Note]
> For retention labels to be available for your model, they need to be [created and published in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/create-apply-retention-labels?view=o365-worldwide#how-to-create-and-publish-retention-labels).
