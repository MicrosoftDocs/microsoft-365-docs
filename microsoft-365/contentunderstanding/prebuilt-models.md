# Create and configure a prebuilt model in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

> [!NOTE]
> The content for this feature is currently in development.

Prebuilt models are pretrained to recognize documents and the components in documents. They also work on image files and PDF files. You can immediately apply prebuilt models to libraries as they are. They don't need additional training or labeling, and no training file is needed.

You can also customize a prebuilt model, review it to see how it works on your documents and customize the names to match your documents or naming convention. You can also turn off suggested components that aren't applicable.
