# Introduction to Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

SharePoint Syntex is a Microsoft 365 service that helps organizations to:

- Use advanced AI and machine teaching to amplify human experiences
- Automate content processing
- Transform content into knowledge

The resources on this page are designed to get you started with learning about and using SharePoint Syntex in your organization.

## Get started

The resources in this section help you learn more about the methods of data classification and extraction used by SharePoint Syntex. There are two custom model types—[document understanding](document-understanding-overview.md) and [form processing](form-processing-overview.md)—and a [prebuilt](prebuilt-overview.md) model type.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get started with SharePoint Syntex without buying licenses by [creating a content center from the SharePoint admin center](create-a-content-center.md). Unlicensed users can create document understanding models but can't apply them to a document library.
