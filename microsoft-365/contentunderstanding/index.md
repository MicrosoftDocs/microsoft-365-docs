# Introduction to Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex is a Microsoft 365 service that provides an end-to-end intelligent document processing solution for your organization. With SharePoint Syntex, you can:

- Use advanced AI and machine teaching and learning to amplify human experiences
- Automate content processing
- Transform content into knowledge

The resources on this page are designed to get you started with learning about and using Syntex in your organization.

## Get started

The resources in this section help you learn more about the methods of data classification and extraction used by Syntex. There are two custom model types—[document understanding](document-understanding-overview.md) and [form processing](form-processing-overview.md)—and a [prebuilt](prebuilt-overview.md) model type.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get started with Syntex without buying licenses by [creating a content center from the SharePoint admin center](create-a-content-center.md). Unlicensed users can create document understanding models but can't apply them to a document library.
