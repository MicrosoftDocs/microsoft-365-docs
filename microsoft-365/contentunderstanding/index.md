## Get started

The resources in this section help you learn more about the three methods of data classification and extraction used by SharePoint Syntex: document understanding, form processing, and prebuilt.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get started with SharePoint Syntex without buying licenses by [creating a content center from the SharePoint admin center](create-a-content-center.md). Unlicensed users can create document understanding models but can't apply them to a document library.
