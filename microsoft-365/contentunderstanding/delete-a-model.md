# Delete a model in Microsoft Syntex

<sup>**Applies to:**  &ensp; &#10003; All custom models &ensp; | &ensp; &#10003; All prebuilt models</sup>

At some point, you might want to delete a model. Before you delete the model, you must first remove the model from all of the SharePoint document libraries where it has been applied.
