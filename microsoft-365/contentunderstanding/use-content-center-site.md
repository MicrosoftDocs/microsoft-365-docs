# Use the content center site template for Microsoft Syntex

The Microsoft Syntex content center site is a ready-to-deploy instructional SharePoint site template designed to help you better understand Syntex capabilities.

You'll be introduced to the tools and information you’ll need to create and train your own models. You'll then be able to use this site as a central content repository or as the control center for managing your own Syntex models.

In this site, models can be trained and evaluated using your own content. However, to apply the models to libraries, a license for Syntex is required.  

## Provision the site

The content center site can be provisioned from the [SharePoint look book service](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/).
