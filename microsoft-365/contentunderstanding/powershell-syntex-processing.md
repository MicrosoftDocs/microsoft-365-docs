# Use PowerShell to request processing by a document understanding model

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SharePoint Syntex PowerShell cmdlets and all other PnP components are open-source tools backed by an active community providing support for them. There is no SLA for open-source tool support from official Microsoft support channels.

Document understanding models will process newly uploaded files to a library. It is also possible to manually request processing in the UI. However there might be scenarios where it is more efficient to trigger processing through PowerShell.

## Request processing of all items that have not been previously classified

You can request processing for all items in the library that have not previously been classified by using this command:

```PowerShell
#Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"

Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -List "Documents"
```

For lower priority processing, you might also consider using the -OffPeak parameter, which will queue files for processing outside of business hours where your tenant is located. See [Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract.html) for more details.

## Request processing of all items in a library

You can request processing of all files in the library, even if they have previously been classified. This might be useful if you have updated a model or added another model to the library.

```PowerShell
#Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"

Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -List "Documents" -Force
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using the -Force option with more than 5000 items will automatically enable off peak processing.

## Request processing of all items based on a property

If you want to limit processing to a specific subset of items in a library, you can use a script to select a specific group of files. In the following example, the script allows a field to be selected, and a field value to filter by. More complex queries can be completed using [Get-PnPListItem](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Get-PnPListItem.html).

```PowerShell
#Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"
$list = Get-PnPList -Identity "Documents"
# Set the field name to filter items by
$fieldName = "Vendor"
# Set the field value to filter by
$fieldFilter = "Fabrikam"

$listItems = (Get-PnPListItem -List $list -fields $fieldName).fieldValues
$targetItems = $listItems | Where-Object -Property Provider -EQ -Value $fieldFilter

# Create a new batch
$batch = New-PnPBatch

# Add files to classify to the batch
foreach ($listItem in $targetItems) {
    Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl $listItem.FileRef -Batch $classifyBatch
}

# Execute batch
Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch
```

## Request processing of specific files

Processing can also be requested for specific files.

```PowerShell
#Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"

Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl "/sites/finance/documents/contoso contract.docx"
```

The file by file model also supports batching:

```PowerShell
#Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"

# Create a new batch
$batch = New-PnPBatch

# Add files to classify to the batch
Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl "/sites/finance/documents/contoso contract.docx" -Batch $batch
Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl "/sites/finance/documents/relecloud contract.docx" -Batch $batch

# Execute batch
Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch
```
