# Import a term set using a SKOS-based format

You can import a term set using a SKOS-based format. For details about the format, see [SharePoint taxonomy SKOS format reference](skos-format-reference.md). This feature requires a [SharePoint Syntex](index.md) license.

We recommend keeping your import files to less than 20,000 terms. Larger files can increase the time taken for validation and import.

1. In the SharePoint admin center, expand **Content services**, and then click **Term store**.

2. Select the term group where you want to import the term set.

3. In the command bar, click **Import term set**.

4. If you want to download a sample file to use as a template, click **sample-metadata.ttl** to get a sample file that uses the SKOS-based format.

5. Create the import file that contains the term sets & terms you wish to import.

6. Under **File format**, select **SKOS (*.ttl)**.

7. Click **Browse** and navigate to and add your import file.

8. Click **Import**. Do not close the panel until the import completes.

On successful import of the file, a success message will be displayed, and the term store will refresh and you can navigate to the newly created term sets.
