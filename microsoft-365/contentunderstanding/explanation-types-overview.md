# Introduction to explanation types

Explanations are used to help to define the information you want to label and extract in your document understanding models in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex. When creating an explanation, you need to select an explanation type. This article helps you understand the different explanation types and how they are used. 

   ![Explanation types](../media/content-understanding/explanation-types.png) 
   
These explanation types are available:

- **Phrase list**: List of words, phrases, numbers, or other characters you can use in the document or information that you are extracting. For example, the text string **Referring Doctor** is in all Medical Referral documents you are identifying.</br>

- **Pattern list**: List patterns of numbers, letters, or other characters that you can use to identify the information that you are extracting. For example, you can extract the **Phone number** of the referring doctor from all Medical Referral document that you are identifying.</br>

- **Proximity**: Describes how close explanations are to each other. For example, a *street number* pattern list goes right before the *street name* phrase list, with no tokens in between (you'll learn about tokens later in this article). Using the proximity type requires you to have at least two explanations in your model or the option will be disabled. 
 
## Phrase list

A phrase list explanation type is typically used to identify and classify a document through your model. As described in the *Referring Doctor* label example, it is a string of words, phrases, numbers, or characters that is consistently in the documents that you are identifying.

While not a requirement, you can achieve better success with your explanation if the phrase you are capturing is located in a consistent location in your document. For example, the *Referring Doctor* label may be consistently located in the first paragraph of the document.

If case sensitivity is a requirement in identifying your label, using the phrase list type allows you to specify it in your explanation by selecting the **Only exact capitalization** checkbox.

## Pattern lists

A pattern list type is especially useful when you create an explanation that identifies and extracts information from a document. It is typically presented in different formats, such as dates, phone numbers, and credit card numbers. For example, a date can be displayed in a number of different formats (1/1/2020, 1-1-2020, 01/01/20, 01/01/2020, Jan 1,2020, etc.). Defining a pattern list makes your explanation more efficient by capturing any possible variations in the data that you are trying to identify and extract. 

For the **Phone number** example, you extract the phone number for each referring doctor from all Medical Referral documents that the model identifies. When you create the explanation, select the Pattern list type to allow the different formats that you may expect to be returned.

   ![Phone number pattern list](../media/content-understanding/pattern-list.png)

For this example, select the **Any digit from 0-9** checkbox to recognize each "0" value used in your pattern list to be any digit from 0 through 9.

   ![Any digit from 0-9](../media/content-understanding/digit-identity.png)

Similarly, if you create a pattern list that includes text characters, select the **Any letter from a-z** checkbox to recognize each "a" character used in the pattern list to be any character from "a" to "z".

For example, if you create a **Date** pattern list and you want to make sure that a date format such as *Jan 1, 2020* is recognized, you need to:
- Add *aaa 0, 0000* and *aaa 00, 0000* to your pattern list.
- Make sure that **Any letter from a-z** is also selected.

   ![Any letter from a-z](../media/content-understanding/any-letter.png)

Additionally, if you have capitalization requirements in your pattern list, you have the option to select the **Only exact capitalization** checkbox. For the Date example, if you require the first letter of the month to be capitalized, you need to:

- Add *Aaa 0, 0000* and *Aaa 00, 0000* to your pattern list.
- Make sure that **Only exact capitalization** is also selected.

   ![Only exact capitalization](../media/content-understanding/exact-caps.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of manually creating a pattern list explanation, use the [explanation library](#use-explanation-templates) to use pattern list templates for a common pattern list, such as *date*, *phone number*, *credit card number*, etc.

## Proximity 

The proximity explanation type helps your model identify data by defining how close another piece of data is to it. For example, in your model say you have defined two explanations that label both the customer *Street address number* and *Phone number*. 

Notice that customer phone numbers always appear before the street address number. 

Alex Wilburn<br>
555-555-5555<br>
One Microsoft Way<br>
Redmond, WA 98034<br>

Use the proximity explanation to define how far away the phone number explanation is to better identify the street address number in your documents.

   ![Proximity explanation](../media/content-understanding/proximity.png)</br>

#### What are tokens?

In order to use the proximity explanation type, you need to understand what a token is, as the number of tokens is how the proximity explanation measures distance from one explanation to another. A token is a continuous span (not including spaces or punctuation) of letters and numbers. 

The following table shows examples for how to determine the number of tokens in a phrase.

|Phrase|Number of tokens|Explanation|
|--|--|--|
|`Dog`|1|A single word with no punctuation or spaces.|
|`RMT33W`|1|A record locator number. It may include numbers and letters, but does not have punctuation.|
|`425-555-5555`|5|A phone number. Each punctuation mark is a single token, so `425-555-5555` is 5 tokens:<br>`425`<br>`-`<br>`555`<br>`-`<br>`5555` |
|`https://luis.ai`|7|`https`<br>`:`<br>`/`<br>`/`<br>`luis`<br>`.`<br>`ai`<br>|

#### Configure the proximity explanation type

For the example, configure the proximity setting to define the range of the number of tokens in the *Phone number* explanation from the *Street address number* explanation. Notice that the minimum range is "0", because there are no tokens between the phone number and street address number.

But some phone numbers in the sample documents are appended with *(mobile)*.

Nestor Wilke<br>
111-111-1111 (mobile)<br>
One Microsoft Way<br>
Redmond, WA 98034<br>

There are three tokens in *(mobile)*:

|Phrase|Token count|
|--|--|
|(|1|
|mobile|2|
|)|3|

Configure the proximity setting to have a range of 0 through 3.

## Configure where phrases occur in the document

When you create an explanation, by default the entire document is searched for the phrase you are trying to extract. However, you can use the <b>Where these phrases occur</b> advanced setting to help in isolating a specific location in the document that a phrase occurs. This is useful in situations where similar instances of a phrase might appear somewhere else in the document, and you want to make sure that the correct one is selected. Referring to our Medical Referral document example, the **Referring Doctor** is always mentioned in the first paragraph of the document. With the <b>Where these phrases occur</b> setting, in this example you can configure your explanation to search for this label only in the beginning section of the document, or any other location in which it might occur.

   ![Where these phrases occur setting](../media/content-understanding/phrase-location.png)</br>

You can choose the following options for this setting:

- Anywhere in the file: The entire document is searched for the phrase.
- Beginning of the file:  The document is searched from the beginning to the phrase location.</br> 
   ![Beginning of file](../media/content-understanding/beginning-of-file.png)</br>
In the viewer, you can manually adjust the select box to include the location where the phase occurs. The <b>End position</b> value will update to show the number of tokens your selected area includes. Note that you can update the End position value as well to adjust the selected area.</br>
   ![Beginning of file position box](../media/content-understanding/beginning-box.png)</br>

- End of the file:  The document is searched from the end to the phrase location.</br> 
   ![End of file](../media/content-understanding/end-of-file.png)</br>
In the viewer, you can manually adjust the select box to include the location where the phase occurs. The <b>Starting position</b> value will update to show the number of tokens your selected area includes. Note that you can update the Starting position value as well to adjust the selected area.</br> 
   ![End of file end box](../media/content-understanding/end-box.png)</br>
- Custom range:  The document is searched in a specified range within the it for the phrase location.</br> 
   ![Custom range](../media/content-understanding/custom-file.png)</br>
In the viewer, you can manually adjust the select box to include the location where the phase occurs. For this setting, you need to select a <b>Start</b> and an <b>End</b> position. These values represent the number of tokens from the begging of the document. While you can manually enter in these values, it is easier to manually adjust the select box in the viewer.</br> 
   
## Use explanation templates

While you can manually add various phrase list values for your explanation, it can be easier to use the templates provided to you in the explanation library.

For example, instead of manually adding all the variations for *Date*, you can use the phrase list template for *Date* as it already includes a number of phrase lists values:</br>

   ![Explanation library](../media/content-understanding/explanation-template.png)</br>
 
The explanation library includes commonly used phrase list explanations, including:</br>

- Date</br>
- Date (numeric)</br>
- Time</br>
- Number</br>
- Percentage</br>
- Phone number</br>
- Zip code</br>
- First word of sentence</br>
- End of sentence</br>
- Credit card</br>
- Social security number</br>
- Checkbox</br>
- Currency</br>
- Email CC</br>
- Email date</br>
- Email greeting</br>
- Email recipient</br>
- Email sender</br>
- Email subject</br>

The explanation library also includes three automatic template types that work with the data you've labeled in your example files:

- After label: The words or characters that occur after the labels in the example files.</br>
- Before label: The words or characters that occur before the labels in the example files.</br>
- Labels: Up to the first 10 labels from the example files.</br>

To give you an example of how automatic templates work, in the following example file, we will use the Before Label explanation template to help give the model more information to get a more accurate match.

   ![Example file](../media/content-understanding/before-label.png)</br>

When you select the Before Label explanation template, it will look for the first set of words that appear before the label in your example files. In the example, the words that are identified in the first example file is "As of".

   ![Before label template](../media/content-understanding/before-label-explanation.png)</br>

You can select <b>Add</b> to create an explanation from the template.  As you add more example files, additional words will be identified and added to the phrase list.

   ![Add the label](../media/content-understanding/before-label-add.png)</br>
 
#### To use a template from the explanation library

1. From the **Explanations** section of your model's **Train** page, select **New**, then select **From a template**.</br>

   ![Add Before Label](../media/content-understanding/from-template.png)</br>

2.  On the **Explanation templates** page, select the explanation you want to use, then select **Add**.</br>

       ![Select a template](../media/content-understanding/phone-template.png)</br>

3. The information for the template you selected displays on the **Create an explanation** page. If needed, edit the explanation name and add or remove items from the phrase list. </br> 

   ![Edit template](../media/content-understanding/phone-template-live.png)</br>

4. When finished, select **Save**.
