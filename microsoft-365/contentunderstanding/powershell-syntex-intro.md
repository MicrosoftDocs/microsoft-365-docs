# Manage Microsoft Syntex by using PowerShell

> The Microsoft Syntex PowerShell cmdlets and all other PnP components are open-source tools backed by an active community providing support for them. There is no SLA for open-source tool support from official Microsoft support channels.

For these scenarios, the Syntex cmdlets in the PnP PowerShell module can be used to interact with models and explanations. To learn more about how to install this module, see [PnP PowerShell overview](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets).
