# Create an enterprise model in Microsoft Syntex

<sup>**Applies to:**  &ensp; &#10003; All custom models &ensp; | &ensp; &#10003; All prebuilt models</sup>

An enterprise model is created and trained in the [content center](create-a-content-center.md), and can be discovered by others to use. Whether you want to create a custom model or use a prebuilt model, you can do so from any of these places in Microsoft Syntex:

- From the **Models** library
- From the [content center](create-a-content-center.md) home page
- From any document library in a site where Syntex has been activated

For this article, we start in the **Models** library. For information about the different model types, see [Overview of model types in Syntex](model-types-overview.md).

If you want to create a local model, see [Create a model on a local SharePoint site](create-local-model.md).

## Create a model

From the **Models** library, select **Create a model**.

![Screenshot of the Models library showing the Create a model button.](../media/content-understanding/create-a-model-from-the-models-page.png) 

On the **Options for model creation** page, there are two sections:

- [**Train a custom model**](#train-a-custom-model)
    
- [**Set up a prebuilt model**](#set-up-a-prebuilt-model)

![Screenshot of the Options for model creation page showing the custom models and prebuilt models.](../media/content-understanding/options-for-model-creation.png) 

> [!NOTE]
> All model options might not be available. These options are configured by your Microsoft 365 admin.

## Train a custom model

The **Train a custom model** section shows the types of custom models you can create.

![Screenshot of the Build a custom model section on the Options for model creation page.](../media/content-understanding/build-a-custom-model-section.png) 

- **Teaching method** – Creates an [unstructured document processing model](document-understanding-overview.md).

- **Freeform selection method** – Creates a [freeform document processing model](freeform-document-processing-overview.md).

- **Layout method** – Creates a [structured document processing model](form-processing-overview.md).

Select one of the following tabs to continue with the custom model you want to use.
