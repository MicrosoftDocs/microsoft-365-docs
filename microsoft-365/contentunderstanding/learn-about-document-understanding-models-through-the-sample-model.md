# Learn about document understanding models through a sample model

Microsoft SharePoint Syntex provides you a with a sample model you can use to examine, giving you a better understanding of how to create your own models. The sample model also allows you to examine model components, such as its classifier, extractors, and explanations. You can also use the sample files to train the model.

## Import the sample model

To access the sample model, you need to first import the model to your content center.

1. From the content center, select **Models** to see your models list.</br>
2. On the **Models** page, select **Import sample model**.</br>

    ![Import sample model](../media/content-understanding/import-sample-model.png) </br>

3. When the import completes, the **BenefitsChangeNotice** model home page will open. If you need to open the sample model in the future, you can do this from the models list in the content center. </br>

     ![Sample home page](../media/content-understanding/sample-home-page.png)</br>

You can not only look through analyze the sample model to get a better understanding of how the model is constructed, but as a working model can go further and do things such as:

- Add a another extractor. For example, add one that extracts the *discount fee*.
- Apply the model to a document library, and upload some of the training files to it to see how the model classifies files and extracts data from them.
