# Windows Breach Notification Under the GDPR

Microsoft Windows takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seriously. The information in this topic is designed to answer customer questions about how Windows protects against a personal data breach and how we respond and notify you if a breach occurs.

## Windows privacy protection measures

Microsoft is committed to protecting Windows and takes considerable measures to prevent personal data breaches from occurring as a means of maintaining customer trust. All Windows products receive privacy reviews before they are released to market to make certain that personal data is protected and privacy requirements of the GDPR are met. Microsoft conducts privacy reviews for all Windows product updates that relate to personal data.

### Data access controls

Windows also implements robust program requirements around access to data. Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to keep Windows up-to-date, secure, and operating properly.

To use data, Windows engineering teams must demonstrate a business need consistent with legitimate use. Microsoft privacy professionals review requests to access data by authorized employees, vendors, and third parties on a regular documented schedule. Access is granted only to individuals who demonstrate a clear business need, and only for as long as required for that need.

### Incident response training

Employees are required to take training that covers Windows privacy fundamentals, GDPR regulations, and best practices on how to prevent privacy breaches. We track training completion, and revoke data access for individuals who do not keep current with training requirements.

In addition to ongoing training, each year Windows executes privacy event table-top exercises in partnership with appropriate internal departments to be prepared for real-world incidents — whether security, physical, or privacy incidents. After the exercises, we document the outcome and remediation methods we have decided to use.

## How Windows detects and responds to privacy events

Windows continuously monitors for emerging privacy events across all data stores containing personal data — both online and offline. We use different methods to detect privacy events, including automated alerts, customer reports, reports from external parties, observation of anomalies, and indications of malicious or hacker activity. A privacy event is a compromised or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data.

When Windows identifies a privacy event, a dedicated Windows security team assesses the event, coordinates with appropriate departments within Microsoft to immediately classify its severity level, and alerts internal stakeholders within 48 hours of the event discovery. The team also records event details in the Enterprise Governance, Risk, And Compliance (EGRC) system for tracking purposes and works with engineering teams on a recovery plan that mitigates, eradicates, or contains the event issues. 

A privacy event is considered a *personal data breach* if it is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. If the Windows security team classifies the event as a personal data breach, it involves the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) Software Security Incident Response Plan (SSIRP) team, which assumes overall management of the breach. Microsoft follows GDPR regulations to provide appropriate data breach notification.

## How Windows notifies customers of a breach

When Microsoft declares a personal data breach for Windows products, apps, or services that process personal data where we are the controller and determine the purpose and means of data processing, we notify the appropriate Data Protection Authority (DPA) within 72 hours. If required by the GDPR, we send notification to data subjects (the persons identified by the data) of the data breach without undue delay.

### Breach notification when Microsoft operates as the data processor

When Microsoft declares a personal data breach for a product that processes your data—such as Windows Defender Advanced Threat Controller or Windows Analytics—we notify you via email within 72 hours. This 72-hour notice requirement is a corporate commitment of Microsoft—not an explicit statutory requirement under the GDPR. We will use the email contact or distribution list you have provided for this purpose (see [Call to action for customers](#call-to-action-for-customers)). Microsoft recognizes that when we operate as your processor, you are responsible for notifying the DPA and your own data subjects of the breach. We provide you with the information you will need to proceed with notice in these circumstances. This includes the following information, if applicable and known:

* Nature of the breach
* Mitigation measures Microsoft has taken
* Product, service, application involved
* Length of time personal data was exposed, if known
* Volume of affected/exposed personal data records, if known
* Sub-processor/supplier details, if one is involved in the breach

### Call to action for customers

To receive personal data breach notification, an enterprise must provide Microsoft with the email address of a designated privacy contact. A privacy contact can be one or more persons—either internal or external to your organization—who can contact your internal stakeholders (for example, your Data Protection Officer (DPO) if you have one) to make certain that DPAs are notified, as required under the GDPR. You can also specify a distribution list as your privacy contact.

If you do not specify a privacy contact, Microsoft will default to notifying your organization’s Global Tenant Administrator.
