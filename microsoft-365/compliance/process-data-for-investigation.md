# Process data for an investigation

Processing is the process of file identification, expansion of embedded documents and attachments, text extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of image files and indexing of that content.  

When a person is added in **People of interest** tab, all partially indexed items from Microsoft 365 are processed to make them fully searchable.  Likewise, when data is added to the **Evidence** tab from Microsoft 365 or non-Microsoft 365 data sources, the content is also processed.

The **Processing** tab in Data Investigations (Preview) provides transparency into the status of *Advanced Indexing* for all of these scenarios.

See the following articles for more details.

- [Advanced indexing of data for an investigation](index-data-people-of-interest.md)

- [Error remediation when processing data](error-remediation.md)
