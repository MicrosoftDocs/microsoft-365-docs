description: "Mailbox audit logging is turned on by default in Microsoft 365 (also called 'default mailbox auditing' or 'mailbox auditing on by default'). This configuration means that certain actions performed by mailbox owners, delegates, and admins are automatically logged in a mailbox audit log, where you can search for activities performed on the mailbox."

# Manage mailbox auditing

Starting in January 2019, Microsoft is turning on mailbox audit logging by default for all organizations. This means that certain actions performed by mailbox owners, delegates, and admins are automatically logged, and the corresponding mailbox audit records will be available when you search for them in the mailbox audit log. Before mailbox auditing was turned on by default, you had to manually enable it for every user mailbox in your organization.

Here are some benefits of mailbox auditing on by default:

- Auditing is automatically enabled when you create a new mailbox. You don't need to manually enable it for new users.
- You don't need to manage the mailbox actions that are audited. A predefined set of mailbox actions are audited by default for each logon type (Admin, Delegate, and Owner).
- When Microsoft releases a new mailbox action, the action might be added automatically to the list of mailbox actions that are audited by default (subject to the user having the appropriate license). This means you don't need to monitor add new actions on mailboxes.
- You have a consistent mailbox auditing policy across your organization (because you're auditing the same actions for all mailboxes).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The important thing to remember about the release of mailbox auditing on by default is: you don't need to do anything to manage mailbox auditing. However, to learn more, customize mailbox auditing from the default settings, or turn it off altogether, this article can help you.
> - By default, only mailbox audit events for users with licenses that include [Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium)](advanced-audit.md) are available in audit log searches in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal or via the Office 365 Management Activity API. These licenses are described [here](auditing-solutions-overview.md#audit-premium-1). For brevity, this article will collectively refer to licenses that include Audit (Premium) as *E5/A5/G5 licenses*.

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

## Verify mailbox auditing on by default is turned on

To verify that mailbox auditing on by default is turned on for your organization, run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):

```PowerShell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-List AuditDisabled
```

The value **False** indicates that mailbox auditing on by default is enabled for the organization. This on by default organizational value overrides the mailbox auditing setting on specific mailboxes. For example, if mailbox auditing is disabled for a mailbox (the *AuditEnabled* property is **False** on the mailbox), the default mailbox actions will still be audited for the mailbox, because mailbox auditing on by default is enabled for the organization.

To keep mailbox auditing disabled for specific mailboxes, you configure mailbox auditing bypass for the mailbox owner and other users who have been delegated access to the mailbox. For more information, see the [Bypass mailbox audit logging](#bypass-mailbox-audit-logging) section later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> When mailbox auditing on by default is turned on for the organization, the *AuditEnabled* property for affected mailboxes won't be changed from **False** to **True**. In other words, mailbox auditing on by default ignores the *AuditEnabled* property on mailboxes.

## Supported mailbox types

The following table shows the mailbox types that are currently supported by mailbox auditing on by default:

|Mailbox type|Supported|
|---|:---:|
|User mailboxes|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)|
|Shared mailboxes|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)|
|Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)|
|Resource mailboxes||
|Public folder mailboxes||

## Logon types and mailbox actions

Logon types classify the user that did the audited actions on the mailbox. The following list describes the logon types that are used in mailbox audit logging:

- **Owner**: The mailbox owner (the account that's associated with the mailbox).
- **Delegate**:
  - A user who's been assigned the SendAs, SendOnBehalf, or FullAccess permission to another mailbox.
  - An admin who's been assigned the FullAccess permission to a user's mailbox.
- **Admin**:
  - The mailbox is searched with one of the following Microsoft eDiscovery tools:
    - Content Search in the Compliance center.
    - eDiscovery or eDiscovery (Premium) in the Compliance center.
    - In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Online.
  - The mailbox is accessed by using the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Editor.

### Mailbox actions for user mailboxes and shared mailboxes

The following table describes the mailbox actions that are available in mailbox audit logging for user mailboxes and shared mailboxes.

- A check mark (![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)) indicates the mailbox action can be logged for the logon type (not all actions are available for all logon types).
- An asterisk ( <sup>\*</sup> ) after the check mark indicates the mailbox action is logged by default for the logon type.
- Remember, an admin with Full Access permission to a mailbox is considered a delegate.

|Mailbox action|Description|Admin|Delegate|Owner|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you customized the mailbox actions to audit for any logon type *before* mailbox auditing on by default was enabled in your organization, the customized settings are preserved on the mailbox and aren't overwritten by the default mailbox actions as described in this section. To revert the audit mailbox actions to their default values (which you can do at any time), see the [Restore the default mailbox actions](#restore-the-default-mailbox-actions) section later in this article.

### Mailbox actions for Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes

Mailbox auditing on by default brings mailbox audit logging to Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes, but you can't customize what's being logged (you can't add or remove mailbox actions that are logged for any logon type).

The following table describes the mailbox actions that are logged by default on Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes for each logon type.

Remember, an admin with Full Access permission to a Microsoft 365 Group mailbox is considered a delegate.

|Mailbox action|Description|Admin|Delegate|Owner|
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Create**|Creation of a calendar Item. Creating, sending, or receiving a message isn't audited.|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>||
|**HardDelete**|A message was purged from the Recoverable Items folder.|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|
|**MoveToDeletedItems**|A message was deleted and moved to the Deleted Items folder.|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|

|**SoftDelete**|A message was permanently deleted or deleted from the Deleted Items folder. Soft-deleted items are moved to the Recoverable Items folder.|![Check mark.](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|![Check mark](../media/checkmark.png)<sup>\*</sup>|

### Verify that default mailbox actions are being logged for each logon type

Mailbox auditing on by default adds a new *DefaultAuditSet* property to all mailboxes. The value of this property indicates whether the default mailbox actions (managed by Microsoft) are being audited on the mailbox.

To display the value on user mailboxes or shared mailboxes, replace \<MailboxIdentity\> with the name, alias, email address, or user principal name (username) of the mailbox and run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Format-List DefaultAuditSet
```

To display the value on Microsoft 365 group mailboxes, replace \<MailboxIdentity\> with the name, alias, or email address of the shared mailbox and run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -GroupMailbox | Format-List DefaultAuditSet
```

The value `Admin, Delegate, Owner` indicates:

- The default mailbox actions for all three logon types are being audited. This is the only value you'll see on Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes.
- An admin *has not* changed the audited mailbox actions for any logon type on a user mailbox or a shared mailbox. Note this is the default state after mailbox auditing on by default is initially turned on in your organization.

If an admin has ever changed the mailbox actions that are audited for a logon type (by using the *AuditAdmin*, *AuditDelegate*, or *AuditOwner* parameters on the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet), the property value will be different.

For example, the value `Owner` for the *DefaultAuditSet* property on a user mailbox or shared mailbox indicates:

- The default mailbox actions for the mailbox owner are being audited.
- The audited mailbox actions for the `Delegate` and `Admin` logon types have been changed from the default actions.

A blank value for the *DefaultAuditSet* property indicates the mailbox actions for all three logon types have been changed on the user mailbox or a shared mailbox.

For more information, see the [Change or restore mailbox actions logged by default](#change-or-restore-mailbox-actions-logged-by-default) section in this article

### Display the mailbox actions that are being logged on mailboxes

To see the mailbox actions that are currently being logged on user mailboxes or shared mailboxes, replace \<MailboxIdentity\> with the name, alias, email address, or user principal name (username) of the mailbox, and run one or more of the following commands in Exchange Online PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> Although you can add the `-GroupMailbox` switch to the following **Get-Mailbox** commands for Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes, don't believe the values that are returned. The default and static mailbox actions that are audited for Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes are described in the [Mailbox actions for Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes](#mailbox-actions-for-microsoft-365-group-mailboxes) section earlier in this article.

#### Owner actions

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty AuditOwner
```

#### Delegate actions

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty AuditDelegate
```

#### Admin actions

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty AuditAdmin
```

## Change or restore mailbox actions logged by default

As previously explained, one of the key benefits of having mailbox auditing on by default is: you don't need to manage the mailboxes actions that are audited. Microsoft does this for you and we'll automatically add new mailbox actions to be audited by default as they're released.

However, your organization might be required to audit a different set of mailbox actions for user mailboxes and shared mailboxes. The procedures in this section show you how to change the mailbox actions that are audited for each logon type, and how to revert back to the Microsoft-managed default actions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the following procedures to customize the mailbox actions that are logged on user mailboxes or shared mailboxes, any new default mailbox actions released by Microsoft will not be automatically audited on those mailboxes. You'll need to manually add any new mailbox actions to your customized list of actions.

### Change the mailbox actions to audit

You can use the *AuditAdmin*, *AuditDelegate*, or *AuditOwner* parameters on the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet to change the mailbox actions that are audited for user mailboxes and shared mailboxes (audited actions for Microsoft 365 group mailboxes can't be customized).

You can use two different methods to specify the mailbox actions:

- *Replace* (overwrite) the existing mailbox actions by using this syntax: `action1,action2,...actionN`.
- *Add or remove* mailbox actions without affecting other existing values by using this syntax: `@{Add="action1","action2",..."actionN"}` or `@{Remove="action1","action2",..."actionN"}`.

This example changes the admin mailbox actions for the mailbox named "Gabriela Laureano" by overwriting the default actions with SoftDelete and HardDelete.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity "Gabriela Laureano" -AuditAdmin HardDelete,SoftDelete
```

This example adds the MailboxLogin owner action to the mailbox laura@contoso.onmicrosoft.com.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity laura@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -AuditOwner @{Add="MailboxLogin"}
```

This example removes the MoveToDeletedItems delegate action for the Team Discussion mailbox.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity "Team Discussion" -AuditDelegate @{Remove="MoveToDeletedItems"}
```

Regardless of the method you use, customizing the audited mailbox actions on user mailboxes or shared mailboxes has the following results:

- For the logon type that you customized, the audited mailbox actions are no longer managed by Microsoft.
- The logon type that you customized is no longer displayed in the *DefaultAuditSet* property value for the mailbox as [previously described](#verify-that-default-mailbox-actions-are-being-logged-for-each-logon-type).

### Restore the default mailbox actions

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedures don't apply to Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes (they're limited to the default actions as described [here](#mailbox-actions-for-microsoft-365-group-mailboxes)).

If you customized the mailbox actions that are audited on a user mailbox or a shared mailbox, you can restore the default mailbox actions for one or all logon types by using this syntax:

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -DefaultAuditSet <Admin | Delegate | Owner>
```

You can specify multiple *DefaultAuditSet* values separated by commas

This example restores the default audited mailbox actions for all logon types on the mailbox mark@contoso.onmicrosoft.com.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity mark@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -DefaultAuditSet Admin,Delegate,Owner
```

This example restores the default audited mailbox actions for the Admin logon type on the mailbox chris@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, but leaves the customized audited mailbox actions for the Delegate and Owner logon types.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -Identity chris@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -DefaultAuditSet Admin
```

Restoring he default audited mailbox actions for a logon type has the following results:

- The current list of mailbox actions is replaced with the default mailbox actions for the logon type.
- Any new mailbox actions that are released by Microsoft are automatically added to the list of audited actions for the logon type.
- The *DefaultAuditSet* property value for the mailbox is updated to include the restored logon type.

## Turn off mailbox auditing on by default for your organization

You can turn off mailbox auditing on by default for your entire organization by running the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Set-OrganizationConfig -AuditDisabled $true
```

Turning off mailbox auditing on by default has the following results:

- Mailbox auditing is disabled for your organization.
- From the time you disabled mailbox auditing on by default, no mailbox actions are audited, even if auditing is enabled on a mailbox (the *AuditEnabled* property on the mailbox is **True**).
- Mailbox auditing is not enabled for new mailboxes and setting the *AuditEnabled* property on a new or existing mailbox to **True** will be ignored.
- Any mailbox audit bypass association settings (configured by using the **Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation** cmdlet) are ignored.
- Existing mailbox audit records are retained until the audit log age limit for the record expires.

### Turn on mailbox auditing on by default

To turn mailbox auditing back on for your organization, run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Set-OrganizationConfig -AuditDisabled $false
```

## Bypass mailbox audit logging

Currently, you can't disable mailbox auditing for specific mailboxes when mailbox auditing on by default is turned on in your organization. For example, setting the *AuditEnabled* mailbox property to **False** is ignored.

However, you can still use the **Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to prevent *any and all* mailbox actions by the specified users from being logged, regardless where the actions occur. For example:

- Mailbox owner actions performed by the bypassed users aren't logged.
- Delegate actions performed by the bypassed users on other users' mailboxes (including shared mailboxes) aren't logged.
- Admin actions performed by the bypassed users aren't logged.

To bypass mailbox audit logging for a specific user, replace \<MailboxIdentity\> with the name, email address, alias, or user principal name (username) of the user and run the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -AuditByPassEnabled $true
```

To verify that auditing is bypassed for the specified user, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Format-List AuditByPassEnabled
```

The value **True** indicates that mailbox audit logging is bypassed for the user.

## More information

- As previously mentioned, although mailbox audit logging on by default is enabled for all organizations, only users with [licenses that include Audit (Premium)](auditing-solutions-overview.md#audit-premium-1) (collectively referred to in this article as *E5/A5/G5 licenses*) will return mailbox audit log events in [audit log searches in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md) or via the [Office 365 Management Activity API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference) **by default**.

  To retrieve mailbox audit log entries for users without E5/A5/G5 licenses, you can use any of the following workarounds:

  - Manually enable mailbox auditing on individual mailboxes (run the command, `Set-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -AuditEnabled $true`). After you do this, you can use audit log searches in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal or via the Office 365 Management Activity API.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If mailbox auditing already appears to be enabled on the mailbox, but your searches return no results, change the value of the *AuditEnabled* parameter to `$false` and then back to `$true`.

  - Use the following cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell:
    - [Search-MailboxAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailboxauditlog) to search the mailbox audit log for specific users.
    - [New-MailboxAuditLogSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxauditlogsearch) to search the mailbox audit log for specific users and to have the results sent via email to specified recipients.

  - Use the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online to do the following actions:
    - [Export mailbox audit logs](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/exchange-auditing-reports/export-mailbox-audit-logs)
    - [Run a non-owner mailbox access report](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/exchange-auditing-reports/non-owner-mailbox-access-report)

- By default, mailbox audit log records are retained for 90 days before they're deleted. You can change the age limit for audit log records by using the *AuditLogAgeLimit* parameter on the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell. However, increasing this value doesn't allow you to search for events that are older than 90 days in the audit log.

  If you increase the age limit, you need to use the [Search-MailboxAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailboxauditlog) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to search the user's mailbox audit log for records that are older than 90 days.

- If you've changed the *AuditLogAgeLimit* property for a mailbox prior to mailbox auditing on by default being turned on for organization, the mailbox's existing audit log age limit isn't changed. In other words, mailbox auditing on by default doesn't affect the current age limit for mailbox audit records.

- To change the *AuditLogAgeLimit* value on a Microsoft 365 Group mailbox, you need to include the `-GroupMailbox` switch in the **Set-Mailbox** command.

- Mailbox audit log records are stored in a subfolder (named *Audits*) in the Recoverable Items folder in each user's mailbox. Keep the following things in mind about mailbox audit records and the Recoverable Items folder:

  - Mailbox audit records count against the storage quota of the Recoverable Items folder, which is 30 GB by default (the warning quota is 20 GB). The storage quota is automatically increased to 100 GB (with a 90 GB warning quota) when:
    - A hold is placed on a mailbox.
    - The mailbox is assigned to a retention policy in the Compliance Center.

  - Mailbox audit records also count against the [folder limit for the Recoverable Items folder](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#mailbox-folder-limits). A maximum of 3 million items (audit records) can be stored in the Audits subfolder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's unlikely that mailbox auditing on by default will impact the storage quota or the folder limit for the Recoverable Items folder.

    - You can run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell to display the size and number of items in the Audits subfolder in the Recoverable Items folder:

      ```PowerShell
      Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -FolderScope RecoverableItems | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'Audits'} | Format-List FolderPath,FolderSize,ItemsInFolder
      ```

    - You can't directly access an audit log record in the Recoverable Items folder; instead, you use the **Search-MailboxAuditLog** cmdlet or search the audit log to find and view mailbox audit records.

- If a mailbox is placed on hold or assigned to a retention policy in the Compliance Center, audit log records are still retained for the duration that's defined by the mailbox's *AuditLogAgeLimit* property (90 days by default). To retain audit log records longer for mailboxes on hold, you need to increase mailbox's *AuditLogAgeLimit* value.

- In a multi-geo environment, cross-geo mailbox auditing is not supported. For example, if a user is assigned permissions to access a shared mailbox in a different geo location, mailbox actions performed by that user are not logged in the mailbox audit log of the shared mailbox. Exchange admin audit events are currently only available for the default location.
