# Set up a connector to archive Workplace from Facebook data

Use a Veritas connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive data from Workplace from Facebook to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Veritas provides a [Workplace from Facebook](https://globanet.com/workplace/) connector that is configured to capture items from the third-party data source (on a regular basis) and import those items to Microsoft 365. The connector converts the content such as chats, attachments, posts, and videos from Workplace to an email message format and then imports those items to user mailboxes in Microsoft 365.

After Workplace data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels, and communication compliance. Using Workplace from Facebook connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving Workplace from Facebook data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive Workplace data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for Workplace from Facebook data.](../media/WorkplaceConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with Workplace from Facebook to set up and configure a Workplace site.

2. Once every 24 hours, items from Workplace are copied to the Veritas Merge1 site. The connector also converts the content of these items to an email message format.

3. The Workplace from Facebook connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, connects to the Veritas Merge1 every day, and transfers the Workplace items to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in Step 3. A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **Workplace from Facebook** is created, and the Workplace items are imported to that folder. The connector does this by using the value of the *Email* property. Every Workplace item contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every chat or post participant.

## Before you begin

- Create a Veritas Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create this account, contact [Veritas Customer Support](https://globanet.com/ms-connectors-contact). You will sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- Create a custom integration at https://my.workplace.com/work/admin/apps/ to retrieve data from Workplace via APIs for compliance and eDiscovery purposes.

   When creating the integration, the Workplace platform generates a set of unique credentials used to generate tokens that are used for authentication. These tokens are used in the Workplace from Facebook connector configuration wizard in Step 2. For step-by step instructions about how to create the applications, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Workplace%20from%20Facebook%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

- The user who creates the Workplace from Facebook connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to a role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the Workplace from Facebook connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and create a connector for Workplace data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** > **Workplace from Facebook**.

2. On the **Workplace from Facebook** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the Workplace from Facebook connector on the Veritas Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the Workplace from Facebook connector on the Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the Workplace from Facebook connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Workplace%20from%20Facebook%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map external users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The Workplace items include a property called *Email* that contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. Click **Next**, review your settings, and then go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the Workplace from Facebook connector

After you create the Workplace from Facebook connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **Workplace from Facebook** connector to display the flyout page. This page contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
