# Use sensitivity labels to protect content in Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

In addition to using [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) to classify and protect documents and emails, you can also use sensitivity labels to protect content in the following containers: Microsoft Teams sites, Microsoft 365 groups ([formerly Office 365 groups](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/office-365-groups-will-become-microsoft-365-groups/ba-p/1303601)), and SharePoint sites. For this container-level classification and protection, use the following label settings:

- Privacy (public or private) of Microsoft 365 group-connected teams sites
- External users access
- Access from unmanaged devices

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Access from unmanaged devices** setting works in conjunction with the SharePoint feature to [control access from unmanaged devices](/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices). You must configure this dependent SharePoint feature for your tenant to use a sensitivity label that has this setting configured. Additional information is included in the instructions that follow.

When you apply this sensitivity label to a supported container, the label automatically applies the classification and protection settings to the connected site or group.

Content in these containers however, do not inherit the labels for the classification and settings such as visual markings, or encryption. So that users can label their documents in SharePoint sites or team sites, make sure you've [enabled sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Sensitivity labels for containers aren't supported with Office 365 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

## Using sensitivity labels for Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites

Before you enable sensitivity labels for containers and configure sensitivity labels for the new settings, users can see and apply sensitivity labels in their apps. For example, from Word:

![A sensitivity label displayed in the Word desktop app](../media/sensitivity-label-word.png)

After you enable and configure sensitivity labels for containers, users can additionally see and apply sensitivity labels to Microsoft team sites, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites. For example, when you create a new team site from SharePoint:

![A sensitivity label when creating a team site from SharePoint](../media/sensitivity-labels-new-team-site.png)

## How to enable sensitivity labels for containers and synchronize labels

1. Because this feature uses Azure AD functionality, follow the instructions from the Azure AD documentation to enable sensitivity label support: [Assign sensitivity labels to Microsoft 365 groups in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels).

2. You now need to synchronize your sensitivity labels to Azure AD. First, [connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell).

   For example, in a PowerShell session that you run as administrator, sign in with a global administrator account.

3. Then run the following command to ensure your sensitivity labels can be used with Microsoft 365 groups:

    ```powershell
    Execute-AzureAdLabelSync
    ```

## How to configure site and group settings

You're now ready to create or edit sensitivity labels that you want to be available for sites and groups. Enabling sensitivity labels for containers makes a new page visible in the sensitivity labeling wizards: **Site and group settings**

If you need help with creating or editing a sensitivity label, see the instructions from [Create and configure sensitivity labels](create-sensitivity-labels.md#create-and-configure-sensitivity-labels).

On this new **Site and group settings** page, configure the settings:

- **Privacy of Office 365 group-connected teams sites**: Keep the default of **Public - anyone in the organization can access the site** if you want anyone in your organization to access the team site or group where this label is applied.

  Select **Private** if you want access to be restricted to only approved members in your organization.

  Select **None - let user chose who can access the site** when you want to protect content in the container by using the sensitivity label, but still let users configure the privacy setting themselves.

  The settings of **Public** or **Private** set and lock the privacy setting when you apply this label to the container. Your chosen setting replaces any previous privacy setting that might be configured for the team or group, and locks the privacy value so it can be changed only by first removing the sensitivity label from the container. After you remove the sensitivity label, the privacy setting from the label remains and users can now change it again.

- **External users access**: Control whether the group owner can [add guests to the group](/office365/admin/create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups).

- **Unmanaged devices**: For this option, you must also configure the SharePoint feature that uses Azure AD conditional access to block or limit access to SharePoint and OneDrive content from unmanaged devices. For instructions, see [Control access from unmanaged devices](/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices). The option you specify for this label setting is the equivalent of [blocking or limiting access to a specific SharePoint site or OneDrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices#block-or-limit-access-to-a-specific-sharepoint-site-or-onedrive).
    
    If you don't configure the dependent SharePoint feature, the option you specify here will have no effect. Additionally, it will have no effect if it's less restrictive than the configured setting at the tenant level. Choose a label setting that's either the same as the tenant-level setting or more restrictive.
    
    For example, if your tenant is configured for **Allow limited, web-only access**, the label setting that allows full access will have no effect because it's less restrictive. For this tenant-level setting, choose the label setting to block access (more restrictive) or the label setting for limited access (the same as the tenant setting).
    
    Because you can configure the SharePoint feature independently from the label configuration, there's no check in the sensitivity label wizard that the dependencies are in place.

![The site and group settings tab](../media/edit-sensitivity-label-site-group2.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only these site and group settings take effect when you apply the label to a team, group, or site. Other label settings, such as encryption and content marking, aren't applied to the content within the team, group, or site.
>
> Gradually rolling out to tenants: Only labels with the site and group settings will be available to select when users create teams, groups, and sites. If you can currently apply a label to a container when the label doesn't have the site and group settings enabled, only the label name is applied to the container.

If your sensitivity label isn't already published, now publish it by [adding it to a sensitivity label policy](create-sensitivity-labels.md#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy). The users who are assigned a sensitivity label policy that includes this label will be able to select it for sites and groups.

From the label policy, only the policy setting **Apply this label by default to documents and email** is applicable when you apply this label to containers. Other policy settings are not applied, which include mandatory labeling, requiring user justification, and a link to the custom help page.

## Sensitivity label management

Use the following guidance for when you create, modify, or delete sensitivity labels that are configured for sites and groups.

### Creating and publishing labels that are configured for sites and groups

When a new sensitivity label is created and published, it's visible for users in teams, groups, and sites within one hour. However, if you modify an existing label, allow up to 24 hours. Use the following guidance to publish a label for your users when that label is configured for site and group settings:

1. After you create and configure the sensitivity label, add this label to a label policy that applies to just a few test users.

2. Wait for the change to replicate:

   - New label: Wait for one hour.
   - Existing label: Wait for 24 hours.

3. After this wait period, use one of the test user accounts to create a team, Microsoft 365 group, or SharePoint site with the label that you created in step 1.

4. If there are no errors during this creation operation, you know it's safe to publish the label to all users in your tenant.

### Modifying published labels that are configured for sites and groups

As a best practice, don't change the site and group settings for a sensitivity label after the label has been applied to teams, groups, or sites. If you do, remember to wait for 24 hours for the changes to replicate to all containers that have the label applied.

In addition, if your changes include the **External users access** setting:

- The new setting applies to new users but not to existing users. For example, if this setting was previously selected and as a result, guest users accessed the site, these guest users can still access the site after this setting is cleared in the label configuration.

- The privacy settings for the group properties hiddenMembership and roleEnabled aren't updated.

### Deleting published labels that are configured for sites and groups

If you delete a sensitivity label that has the site and group settings enabled, and that label is included in one or more label policies, this action can result in creation failures for new teams, groups, and sites. To avoid this situation, use the following guidance:

1. Remove the sensitivity label from all label policies that include the label.

2. Wait for one hour.

3. After this wait period, try creating a team, group, or site and confirm that the label is no longer visible.

4. If the sensitivity label isn't visible, you can now safely delete the label.

## How to apply sensitivity labels to containers

You're now ready to apply the sensitivity label or labels to the following containers:

- [Microsoft 365 group in Azure AD](#apply-sensitivity-labels-to-microsoft-365-groups)
- [Microsoft Teams team site](#apply-a-sensitivity-label-to-a-new-team)
- [Microsoft 365 group in Outlook on the web](#apply-a-sensitivity-label-to-a-new-group-in-outlook-on-the-web)
- [SharePoint site](#apply-a-sensitivity-label-to-a-new-site)

You can use PowerShell if you need to [apply a sensitivity label to multiple sites](#use-powershell-to-apply-a-sensitivity-label-to-multiple-sites).

### Apply sensitivity labels to Microsoft 365 groups

You're now ready to apply the sensitivity label or labels to Microsoft 365 groups. Return to the Azure AD documentation for instructions:

- [Assign a label to a new group in Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels#assign-a-label-to-a-new-group-in-azure-portal)

- [Assign a label to an existing group in Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels#assign-a-label-to-an-existing-group-in-azure-portal)

- [Remove a label from an existing group in Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels#remove-a-label-from-an-existing-group-in-azure-portal).

### Apply a sensitivity label to a new team

Users can select sensitivity labels when they create new teams in Microsoft Teams. When they select the label from the **Sensitivity** dropdown, the privacy setting might change to reflect the label configuration. Depending on the external users access setting you selected for the label, users can or can't add people outside the organization to the team.

[Learn more about sensitivity labels for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/sensitivity-labels)

![The privacy setting when creating a new team](../media/privacy-setting-new-team.png)

After you create the team, the sensitivity label appears in the upper-right corner of all channels.

![The sensitivity label appears on the team](../media/privacy-setting-teams.png)

The service automatically applies the same sensitivity label to the Microsoft 365 group and the connected SharePoint team site.

### Apply a sensitivity label to a new group in Outlook on the web

In Outlook on the web, when you create a new group, you can select or change the **Sensitivity** option for published labels:

![Creating a group and selecting an option under Sensitivity](../media/sensitivity-label-new-group.png)

### Apply a sensitivity label to a new site

Admins and end users can select sensitivity labels when they [create modern team sites and communication sites](/sharepoint/create-site-collection), and expand **Advanced settings**:

![Creating a site and selecting an option under Sensitivity](../media/sensitivity-label-new-communication-site.png)

The dropdown box displays the label names for the selection, and the help icon displays all the label names with their tooltip, which can help users determine the correct label to apply.

When the label is applied, and users browse to the site, they see the name of the label and applied policies. For example, this site has been labeled as **Confidential**, and the privacy setting is set to **Private**:

![A site that has a sensitivity label applied](../media/sensitivity-label-site.png)

### Use PowerShell to apply a sensitivity label to multiple sites

You can use the [Set-SPOSite](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps) and [Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps) cmdlet with the *SensitivityLabel* parameter from the current [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online) to apply a sensitivity label to many sites. The sites can be any SharePoint site collection, or a OneDrive site.

Make sure you have version 16.0.19418.12000 or later of the SharePoint Online Management Shell.

1. Open a PowerShell session with the **Run as Administrator** option.

2. If you don't know your label GUID: [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps) and get the list of sensitivity labels and their GUIDs.

   ```powershell
   Get-Label |ft Name, Guid
   ```

3. Now [connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online) and store your label GUID as a variable. For example:

   ```powershell
   $Id = [GUID]("e48058ea-98e8-4940-8db0-ba1310fd955e")
   ```

4. Create a new variable that identifies multiple sites that have an identifying string in common in their URL. For example:

   ```powershell
   $sites = Get-SPOSite -IncludePersonalSite $true -Limit all -Filter "Url -like 'documents"
   ```

5. Run the following command to apply the label to these sites. Using our examples:

   ```powershell
   $sites | ForEach-Object {Set-SPOTenant $_.url -SensitivityLabel $Id}
   ```

To apply different labels to different sites, repeat the following command for each site: `Set-SPOSite -Identity <URL> -SensitivityLabel "<labelguid>"`

## View and manage sensitivity labels in the SharePoint admin center

To view, sort, and search the applied sensitivity labels, use the **Active sites** page in the new SharePoint admin center. You might need to first add the **Sensitivity** column:

![The Sensitivity column on the Active sites page](../media/manage-site-sensitivity-labels.png)

For more information about managing sites from the Active sites page, including how to add a column, see [Manage sites in the new SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/manage-sites-in-new-admin-center).

You can also change and apply a label from this page:

1. Select the site name to open the details pane.

2. Select the **Policies** tab, and then select **Edit** for the **Sensitivity** setting.

3. From the **Edit sensitivity setting** pane, select the sensitivity label you want to apply to the site, and then select **Save**.

## Classic Azure AD group classification

Microsoft 365 no longer supports the old classifications for new Microsoft 365 groups and SharePoint sites after you enable sensitivity labels for containers. However, existing groups and sites that support sensitivity labels still display the old classification values until you convert them to use sensitivity labels.

As an example of how you might have used the old group classification for SharePoint, see [SharePoint "modern" sites classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/modern-experience-site-classification).

These classifications were configured by using Azure AD PowerShell or the PnP Core library and defining values for the `ClassificationList` setting. If your tenant has classification values defined, they are shown when you run the following command from the [AzureADPreview PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview):

```powershell
($setting["ClassificationList"])
```

To convert your old classifications to sensitivity labels, do one of the following:

- Use existing labels: Specify the label settings you want for sites and groups by editing existing sensitivity labels that are already published.

- Create new labels: Specify the label settings you want for sites and groups by creating and publishing new sensitivity labels that have the same names as your existing classifications.

Then:

1. Use PowerShell to apply the sensitivity labels to existing Microsoft 365 groups and SharePoint sites by using name mapping. See the next section for instructions.

2. Remove the old classifications from the existing groups and sites.

Although you can't prevent users from creating new groups in apps and services that don't yet support sensitivity labels, you can run a recurring PowerShell script to look for new groups that users have created with the old classifications, and convert these to use sensitivity labels.

To help you manage the coexistence of sensitivity labels and Azure AD classifications for sites and groups, see [Azure Active Directory classification and sensitivity labels for Microsoft 365 groups](migrate-aad-classification-sensitivity-labels.md).

### Use PowerShell to convert classifications for Microsoft 365 groups to sensitivity labels

1. First, [connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell).

   For example, in a PowerShell session that you run as administrator, sign in with a global administrator account:

2. Get the list of sensitivity labels and their GUIDs by using the [Get-Label](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-label?view=exchange-ps) cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Get-Label |ft Name, Guid
   ```

3. Make a note of the GUIDs for the sensitivity labels you want to apply to your Microsoft 365 groups.

4. Now [connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps) in a separate Windows PowerShell window.

5. Use the following command as an example to get the list of groups that currently have the classification of "General":

   ```PowerShell
   $Groups= Get-UnifiedGroup | Where {$_.classification -eq "General"}
   ```

6. For each group, add the new sensitivity label GUID. For example:

    ```PowerShell
    foreach ($g in $groups)
    {Set-UnifiedGroup -Identity $g.Identity -SensitivityLabelId "457fa763-7c59-461c-b402-ad1ac6b703cc"}
    ```

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for your remaining group classifications.

## Auditing sensitivity label activities

If somebody uploads a document to a site that's protected with a sensitivity label and their document has a [higher priority](sensitivity-labels.md#label-priority-order-matters) sensitivity label than the sensitivity label applied to the site, this action isn't blocked. For example, you've applied the **General** label to a SharePoint site, and somebody uploads to this site a document labeled **Confidential**. Because a sensitivity label with a higher priority identifies content that is more sensitivity than content that has a lower priority order, this situation could be a security concern.

Although the action isn't blocked, it is audited and automatically generates an email to the person who uploaded the document and the site administrator. As a result, both the user and administrators can identify documents that have this misalignment of label priority and take action if needed. For example, delete or move the uploaded document from the site.

It wouldn't be a security concern if the document has a lower priority sensitivity label than the sensitivity label applied to the site. For example, a document labeled **General** is uploaded to a site labeled **Confidential**. In this scenario, an auditing event and email aren't generated.

To search the audit log for this event, look for **Detected document sensitivity mismatch** from the **File and page activities** category.

The automatically generated email has the subject **Incompatible sensitivity label detected** and the email message explains the labeling mismatch with a link to the uploaded document and site. It also contains a documentation link that explains how users can change the sensitivity label. Currently, these automated emails cannot be disabled or customized.

When somebody adds or removes a sensitivity label to or from a site or group, these activities are also audited but without automatically generating an email.

All these auditing events can be found in the [Sensitivity label activities](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#sensitivity-label-activities) category. For instructions to search the audit log, see [Search the audit log in the Security & Compliance Center](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md).

## How to disable sensitivity labels for containers

You can turn off sensitivity labels for Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites by using the same instructions from [Enable sensitivity label support in PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels#enable-sensitivity-label-support-in-powershell). However, to disable the feature, in step 5, specify `$setting["EnableMIPLabels"] = "False"`.

In addition to hiding the **Sites and group settings** page when you create or edit sensitivity labels, this action reverts which property the containers use for their configuration. Enabling sensitivity labels for Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites switches the property used from **Classification** (used for [Azure AD group classification](#classic-azure-ad-group-classification)) to **Sensitivity**. When you disable sensitivity labels for containers, the containers ignore the Sensitivity property and use the Classification property again.

This means that any label settings from sites and groups previously applied to containers won't be enforced, and containers no longer display the labels.

If these containers have Azure AD classification values applied to them, the containers revert to using the classifications again. Be aware that any new sites or groups that were created after enabling the feature won't display a label or have a classification. For these containers, and any new containers, you can now apply classification values. For more information, see [SharePoint "modern" sites classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/modern-experience-site-classification) and [Create classifications for Office groups in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/manage-microsoft-365-groups-with-powershell).
