# Learn about the data loss prevention Alerts dashboard

When the criteria in a Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is matched by the actions a user is taking on a sensitive item, the policy can generate an alert. This situation can result in a high volume of alerts. DLP alerts are collected in the alerts dashboard. The alerts dashboard gives you a single place to go to do a deep investigation of all the details about the policy match.  

<!-- [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/)-->

## Workloads

The [DLP alert management dashboard](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=dlpalerts), in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>, shows alerts for DLP policies on these workloads:

- Exchange
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Teams
- Windows 10 devices 

> [!TIP]
> Customers who use [Endpoint DLP](endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md) who are eligible for [Teams DLP](dlp-microsoft-teams.md) will see their endpoint DLP policy alerts and Teams DLP policy alerts in the DLP alert management dashboard.

## Single alert and aggregate alert

There are two types of alerts that can be configured in DLP policies.

**Single-event alerts** are typically used in policies that monitor for highly sensitive events that occur in a low volume, like a single email with 10 or more customer credit card numbers being sent outside your organization.

**Aggregate-event alerts** are typically used in policies that monitor for events that occur in a higher volume over a period of time. For example, an aggregate alert can be triggered when 10 individual emails each with one customer credit card number is sent outside your org over 48 hours.

## Types of events

Here are some of the events associated with an alert. In the UI, you can choose a particular event to view its details.
