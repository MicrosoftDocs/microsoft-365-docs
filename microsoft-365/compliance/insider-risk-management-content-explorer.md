# Insider risk management Content explorer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider risk management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

The insider risk management **Content explorer** allows users assigned the *Insider Risk Management Investigators* role to examine the context and details of content associated with activity in alerts. The case data in Content explorer is refreshed daily to include new risk activity. For all alerts that are confirmed to a case, copies of data and message files are archived as a snapshot in time of the items, while maintaining the original files and messages in the storage sources. If needed, case data files may be exported as a portable document file (PDF) or in the original file format.

## Use the Content explorer to view details for a specific case

To examine the emails and files captured by the policies included in a specific case, navigate to the Insider risk management **Cases** page and select the row of the *Case name* in the list for the case you want to view details for. Then in the case details page, select the **Content explorer** tab to open the Content explorer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After an alert is confirmed to a case, Content explorer won't display any details for that case if the organization has not assigned a user to either the *Insider Risk Management Investigator* or *Insider Risk Management* role group.

For new cases, it usually takes about an hour for content to populate in Content explorer. For cases with large amounts of content, it may take longer to create a snapshot. If content is still loading in Content explorer, you will see a progress indicator that displays the completion percentage.

In some cases, data associated with a case may not be available as a snapshot for review in Content explorer. This situation may occur when case data has been deleted or moved, or when a temporary error occurs when processing case data. If this situation occurs, select **View files** in the warning bar to view the file names, file path, and reason for the failure for each file. If needed, this information can be exported to a .csv (comma-separated values) file.

If the content includes Information Rights Management permissions, these permissions are maintained for the copied content and users assigned the *Insider Risk Management Investigators* role will need these permissions and rights if they need to open and view the files. Each file and message are automatically assigned a unique file ID in the insider risk management case for management purposes. Documents associated with device indicator activities are not included in Content explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> Content explorer includes user activities related to Microsoft 365 service files, such as user activity on SharePoint, Exchange, Microsoft Teams, and OneDrive for Business.

## Column options

To make it easier for risk analysts and investigators to review captured data and messages and review the context to the case, several filtering and sorting tools are included in the Content explorer. For basic sorting, the **Date** and **File class** columns support sorting using the column titles in the content queue pane. Other queue columns are available to add to the view to provide different pivots on the files and messages.

To add or remove column headings for the content queue, use the **Edit columns** control and select from the following column options. These columns map to the common, email, and document property conditions supported in the Content explorer and listed later in this article.
