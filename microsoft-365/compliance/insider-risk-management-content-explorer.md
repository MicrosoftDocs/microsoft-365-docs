# Insider risk management Content explorer

The insider risk management **Content explorer** allows users assigned the *Insider Risk Management Investigators* role to examine the context and details of content associated with activity in alerts. The case data in Content explorer is refreshed daily to include new activity. For all alerts that are confirmed to a case, copies of data and message files are archived as a snapshot in time of the items, while maintaining the original files and messages in the storage sources. The copying of data and messages is transparent to the user associated with the alert and to the owner of the content. For new cases, it usually takes about an hour for content to populate in Content explorer. For cases with large amounts of content, it may take longer to create a snapshot. If content is still loading in Content explorer, you will see a progress indicator that displays the completion percentage.

In some cases, data associated with a case may not be available as a snapshot for review in Content explorer. This situation may occur when case data has been deleted or moved, or when a temporary error occurs when processing case data. If this situation occurs, select **View files** in the warning bar to view the file names, file path, and reason for the failure for each file. If needed, this information can be exported to a .csv (comma-separated values) file.

If the content includes Information Rights Management permissions, these permissions are maintained for the copied content and users assigned the *Insider Risk Management Investigators* role will need these permissions and rights if they need to open and view the files. Each file and message are automatically assigned a unique file ID in the insider risk management case for management purposes. Documents associated with device indicator activities are not included in Content explorer.

>[!Note]
>Content explorer includes activities related to Microsoft Office files. Site-level activities, such as when a SharePoint site is deleted or if site permissions are changed, aren't included in Content explorer.

## Column options

To make it easier for risk analysts and investigators to review captured data and messages and review the context to the case, several filtering and sorting tools are included in the Content explorer. For basic sorting, the **Date** and **File class** columns support sorting using the column titles in the content queue pane. Other queue columns are available to add to the view to provide different pivots on the files and messages.

To add or remove column headings for the content queue, use the **Edit columns** control and select from the following column options. These columns map to the common, email, and document property conditions supported in the Content explorer and listed later in this article.

| **Column option** | **Description** |
|:------------------|:----------------|

| **Cc** | Available for email messages, the users in the Cc message field. |

As previously explained, the Title property is metadata specified in Microsoft Office documents. You can type the name of more than one subject/title, separated by commas. Two or more values are logically connected by the OR operator. |
| **Themes list** | Themes list as calculated for analytics. |
| **Title** | The title of the document. The Title property is metadata that's specified in Office documents. It's different than the file name of the document. |

## Advanced search conditions

You can add search conditions to narrow the scope of a search and return a more refined set of results. Each condition adds a clause to the search query that is created and run when you start the search. A condition is logically connected to the keyword query (specified in the keyword box) by a logical operator (which is represented as c:c) that is similar in functionality to the AND operator. That means that items have to satisfy both the keyword query and one or more conditions to be included in the search results. This functionality is how conditions help to narrow your results.

For advanced filter and search tools, expand the **Filter** pane on the left side of the content queue. Select the **Add a condition** button to open the condition list:
