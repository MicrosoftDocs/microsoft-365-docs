# Work with custodians in Advanced eDiscovery

When an organization responds to a legal investigation, the workflow around identifying, preserving, and collecting potentially relevant content is based on the people in the organization who are the custodians of relevant data. In eDiscovery, these individuals are called *data custodians* (or just *custodians*) and are defined as "persons having administrative control of a document or electronic file". For example, the custodian of an email message could be the owner of the mailbox that contains the relevant message.  

When an investigation begins, the eDiscovery team must quickly identify all the relevant custodians and data sources related to the case. Over time, the list of custodians and their data sources may increase or decreasse. As a result, organizations must maintain a controlled process around identifying, preserving, and collecting custodial content throughout the life cycle of a case.

In an Advanced eDiscovery case, legal teams can add individuals in their organization as custodians, and automatically identify and preserve custodial data sources such as Exchange mailboxes, OneDrive accounts, and SharePoint and Teams sites. By using the built-in custodian management tool in Advanced eDiscovery, organizations can secure electronically stored information from inadvertent (or intentional) deletion. This lets you eliminate the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually having to perform the legal hold processes. 

For more information about working with custodians, see the following:

## Advanced eDiscovery permissions

In Advanced eDiscovery, you can use the built-in eDiscovery Manager role group to assign the necessary permissions to legal investigators so they can manage the end-to-end workflow in Advanced eDiscovery. Alternatively, you can create custom role groups with a subset of the roles necessary to perform certain actions in a case in Advanced eDiscovery. For more information about eDiscovery-related roles, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).
