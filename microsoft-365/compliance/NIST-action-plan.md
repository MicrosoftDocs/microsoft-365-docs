# Microsoft 365 NIST 800-53 action plan — Top priorities for your first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond

Microsoft 365 allows you to operate your enterprise with a cloud control framework, which aligns controls with multiple regulatory standards. Microsoft 365 includes Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. Microsoft's internal control system is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 800-53, and Office 365 has been accredited to latest NIST 800-53 standard.

Microsoft is recognized as an industry leader in cloud security. Using years of experience building enterprise software and running online services, our team is constantly learning and continuously updating our services and applications to deliver a secure cloud productivity service that meets rigorous industry standards for compliance. Microsoft's government cloud services, including Office 365 U.S. Government, meet the demanding requirements of the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), enabling U.S. federal agencies to benefit from the cost savings and rigorous security of the Microsoft Cloud.

## 30 days — Powerful Quick Wins

These tasks can be accomplished quickly and have low impact to users.

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Area**|**Tasks**|
|Understand your NIST 800-53 requirements and consider engaging with a Microsoft Advisory Partner.|•	Work with your Microsoft Partner to perform a gap analysis of your NIST 800-53 compliance for the organization and to develop a roadmap that charts your journey to compliance. <br>•   Use guidance in [Microsoft Compliance Score](compliance-score.md) to define and document policies and procedures for both access control and information sharing which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.|
|Learn and understand the Microsoft 365 built-in defense-in-depth strategy.|•	Assess and manage your compliance risks by using [Compliance Score](compliance-score.md) to conduct an NIST 800-53 assessment of your organization.  Align Microsoft 365 security controls for managing and mitigating risks to the assessment’s outcomes. <br>•	Utilize [Microsoft Secure Score](/security/office-365-security/office-365-secure-score.md) to track the organization’s usage of Microsoft 365 security capabilities over time within both Office 365 and on Windows 10 desktops. <br>•	Learn about Microsoft’s technologies and strategies used to provide [Office 365 data encryption](encryption.md), as well as strategies for [protection against denial-of-service attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/office-365-defending-against-denial-of-service-attacks-overview) in the Microsoft Cloud.|
|Protect user and administrator access to Office 365.|•	Establish [strong credential management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-ad-secure-steps#step-1---strengthen-your-credentials) to protect user account credentials. <br> •	Learn about [recommended identity and device access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-policies-configurations) for Office 365 services.<br> •	Utilize the [Office 365 administrative roles](https://support.office.com/article/understanding-administrative-roles-52f29955-6a60-435f-aba9-eb69c898606a) to implement role-based access to administration capabilities and to enable separation of administration duties. Note: many administrator roles in Office 365 have a corresponding role in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online. Segment permissions to ensure that a single administrator does not have greater access than necessary.|
|Ensure all access to the system is audited according to your organization’s audit and accountability policies.|Enable [audit logging](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md) and [mailbox auditing](enable-mailbox-auditing.md) (for all Exchange mailboxes) to monitor Office 365 for potentially malicious activity and to enable forensic analysis of data breaches.|
