# ISO 22301:2012 Business Continuity Management Standard

## ISO 22301 overview

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent nongovernmental organization and the world’s largest developer of voluntary international standards. The ISO formed the TC 223 Societal Security technical committee to develop standards for protecting society, including organizations, if catastrophes such as a natural disaster, major terrorist attack, or the shutdown of power grids occur.

Published in 2012 by the technical committee, ISO 22301:2012 is the first international standard for management systems that help ensure business continuity. ISO 22301 is the premium standard for business continuity, and certification demonstrates conformance to rigorous practices to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from disruptive incidents.

## Microsoft and ISO 22301

Microsoft is the first hyperscale cloud service provider to receive the ISO 22301 certification for business continuity management. An independent certification body awarded this certification to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Azure Government, Microsoft Office 365 (including Commercial, Government, and Education offerings), Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Power BI after a stringent audit covering all aspects of their business continuity processes. The audit covered the in-scope services listed below and Azure management features, the Azure Portal, and the systems used to monitor, operate, and update the in-scope services.
