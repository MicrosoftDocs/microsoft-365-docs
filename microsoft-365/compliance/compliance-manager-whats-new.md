[!include[Purview banner](../includes/purview-rebrand-banner.md)]

**In this article:** Learn about recent updates in Compliance Manager.

## March 2022

### New templates available

**Global**
- ISO 37301
- NIST 800-207 - Zero Trust Architecture
- SIG 2022

### Continuous compliance assessment of improvement actions

We're adding automated testing and evidence generation for over 35 improvement actions in Compliance Manager that were not previously covered by Secure Score. With continuous compliance assessment, you can receive updates about which of these improvement actions you've completed if they're relevant for your compliance assessments and you're licensed to access the relevant solutions. Continuous compliance assessment also gives users visibility into the scoring logic of your improvement actions and provides insight and evidence about why you received a certain score. This feature works alongside existing integrations with Microsoft 365 Secure Score, and any automated actions you've previously configured will continue to work as-is. Learn more about [automated testing settings](compliance-manager-setup.md#set-up-automated-testing).

## February 2022

### Alerts and alert policies

Users can now set alerts for changes in Compliance Manager that an organization wants to track. Using an easy setup wizard, you can build alert policies to create notifications when the following types of events happen: an improvement action score change, an improvement action assignment change, a testing or implementation status change in an improvement action, and a file upload or deletion in an improvement action's Documents tab. Learn more by visiting [Compliance Manager alerts and alert policies](compliance-manager-alert-policies.md).

### Try recommended assessment templates for your organization

Your organization can now get recommendations from Compliance Manager about which assessments may be most relevant to you, with a quick setup process to get up and running. To learn more about recommendations and how to try premium assessment templates before buying a license, see [Start a premium assessments trial](compliance-manager-setup.md#start-a-premium-assessments-trial).

When you take steps in Priva to protect the personal data you store, this can contribute to your privacy assessments in Compliance Manager and can help you improve your compliance score. To see how Priva and other solutions are contributing to your score, and learn about potential opportunities for further improvements, see the **Solutions** tab in Compliance Manager. You can also find more details about Priva at [Learn about Microsoft Priva](/privacy/priva).
