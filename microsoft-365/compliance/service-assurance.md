# Service assurance in the Security & Compliance Center

Use Service assurance in the Security & Compliance Center to access documents that describe a variety of topics, including: 
  
- Microsoft security practices for customer data that is stored in Office 365. 
    
- Independent third-party audit reports of Office 365. 
    
- Implementation and testing details for security, privacy, and compliance controls that Office 365 uses to protect your data. 
    
You can also find out how Office 365 can help customers comply with standards, laws, and regulations across industries, such as the:
  
-  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and 27018 
    
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
    
- Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
    
## Who can access Office 365 Service assurance, and how?

 **New customers, and customers evaluating Microsoft online services** can access Service assurance which is included with Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 plans (both trial and paid subscriptions). If you don't have one of these plans and want to try Service assurance, you can [sign-up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
 **Existing customers of Office 365 for business** can access Service assurance. If you're the Office 365 global admin (sometimes called company administrator) for your organization, you'll already have access to Service assurance, and you can onboard others. If you're not the Office 365 global admin for your organization, and you need access to Service assurance, ask your admin to add you to the Service Assurance User role group. 
  
 **O365 Subscription Members** can access the Service assurance section in the Office365 Protection Center by default if Service assurance roles-based access has not been implemented in your subscription. Service assurance provides reports and documents that describe Microsoft's security practices for customer data that's stored in Office 365. It also provides independent third-party audit reports on Office 365. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Note: If your company has implemented Service Assurance Roles-Based Access in your Office 365 Subscription (which could be if your organization has been provided access to custom reports), and you need access to Service assurance but it is not included in the left pane of the Security & Compliance Center, ask your Office 365 administrator to add you to the Service Assurance User role group on the **Permissions** page. For more information, see Onboard other Service assurance users or groups. 
  
 **Service assurance roles-based access-provisioned users** If your company has implemented Service assurance roles-based access, you can provide Service assurance access to all security and compliance personnel including information security, risk management, compliance, and audit teams and personnel within your organization. For details, see [Onboard other Service assurance users or groups](service-assurance.md#addother).

For accessing default reports that are generally available across all Microsoft Cloud subscriptions, you don't need to implement the Service Assurance roles-based access model and you can skip this step.

1. In the Security & Compliance Center, select **Permissions** in the left pane as shown in the following screenshot. 
    
    ![Security &amp; Compliance Permissions menu](media/8b479ad4-5c91-4e4c-a1db-372d50526db6.png)
  
2. In the right pane, select **Service Assurance User**, and then select **Edit Role Group**, and under the **Members** section, select **Edit** to add members to the Service Assurance User role as shown in the following screenshot. 
    
    ![Service Assurance User - Add](media/c8b1978e-9b6e-4200-860a-a1704f8e2355.png)
  
3. In the next dialog box, search for and choose individuals or groups that need to view Service assurance compliance reports and trust resources, then select **Add** for each selection you make and click the **X** in the upper right corner of the pane when you're finished. 
    
    ![Service Assurance User - Choose user](media/33f13ef6-1e10-4d49-af06-8e1ad5ffbfba.png)
  
4. Every user or group that you added to the Service Assurance User role can now find Service assurance and download reports and other documents in the Security & Compliance Center.
