description: "Admins can set up a connector to import and archive XIP source data from Globanet to Microsoft 365. This connector lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Microsoft 365. After your archive this data, you can use compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage third-party data."

# Set up a connector to archive XIP source data

Use a Globanet connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive data from the XIP source platform to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Globanet provides a [XIP](https://globanet.com/xip/) connector that allows using an XIP file to import items to Microsoft 365. An XIP file is similar to a ZIP file, but allows for a digital signature to be used. The digital signature is verified by the Globanet Merge 1 before the XIP source file is extracted. The connector converts the content from the XIP source file to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After XIP source data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels, and communication compliance. Using an XIP connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving the XIP source data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive the XIP source data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for XIP source data](../media/XIPConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with the XIP source to set up and configure an XIP site.

2. Once every 24 hours, XIP source items are copied to the Globanet Merge1 site. The connector also converts the content to an email message format.

3. The XIP connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, connects to the Globanet Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted message items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **XIP** is created in the user mailboxes, and the items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every source item contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant.

## Before you begin

- Create a Globanet Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create an account, contact [Globanet Customer Support](https://globanet.com/contact-us/). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the XIP connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the Data connectors page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to any role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the XIP connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft365 compliance center and create a connector for the XIP source data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** \> **XIP**.

2. On the **XIP** product description page, click **Add new connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the XIP connector on the Globanet Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the XIP connector on the Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the XIP connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20XIP%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map XIP users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The XIP source items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. On the **Admin Consent** page, click the **Provide Consent** button. You will be redirected to the Microsoft site. Click **Accept** to provide the consent.

   Your organization must consent to allow the Office 365 Import service to access mailbox data in your organization. To provide admin consent, you must be signed in with the credentials of a Microsoft 365 global admin, and then accept the consent request. If you aren't signed in as a global admin, you can go to [this page](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=570d0bec-d001-4c4e-985e-3ab17fdc3073&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com/&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent) and sign in using global admin credentials to accept the request.

3. Click **Next**, review your settings, and go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the XIP connector

After you create the XIP connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **XIP** connector to display the flyout page, which contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
