# Microsoft 365 GDPR action plan — Top priorities for your first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond

This article includes a prioritized action plan you can follow as you work to meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This action plan was developed in partnership with Protiviti, a Microsoft partner specializing in regulatory compliance. 

The GDPR introduces new rules for companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you or your enterprise are located.

## Action plan outcomes

These recommendations are provided across three phases in a logical order with the following outcomes:
