# Enable archive mailboxes in the compliance center

Archiving in Microsoft 365 (also called *In-Place Archiving*) provides users with additional mailbox storage space. For more information, see [Learn about archive mailboxes](archive-mailboxes.md).

Use the information in this article to enable or disable an archive mailbox in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, or by using PowerShell. Also learn how to run an automated diagnostic check on a user's archive mailbox to identify any problems and suggested resolutions.

## Get the necessary permissions

You must be assigned the Mail Recipients role in Exchange Online to enable or disable archive mailboxes. By default, this role is assigned to the Recipient Management and Organization Management role groups on the **Permissions** page in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104" target="_blank">Exchange admin center</a>. 

If you don't see the **Archive** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, ask your administrator to assign you the necessary permissions.

## Enable an archive mailbox

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 compliance center</a> and sign in.

2. In the left pane of the Microsoft 365 compliance center, click **Information governance**, and then click the **Archive** tab.

   The **Archive** page is displayed. The **Archive mailbox** column indicates whether an archive mailbox is enabled or disabled for each user.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Archive** page shows a maximum of 500 users.

3. In the list of mailboxes, select the user that you want to enable the archive mailbox for.

   ![Click Enable in the details pane of the selected user to enable the archive mailbox.](../media/8b53cdec-d5c9-4c28-af11-611f95c37b34.png)

4. In the details pane for the selected user, click **Enable**.

   A warning is displayed saying that if you enable the archive mailbox, items in the user's mailbox that are older than the archiving policy assigned to the mailbox will be moved to the new archive mailbox. The default archive policy that is part of the retention policy assigned to Exchange Online mailboxes moves items to the archive mailbox two years after the date the item was delivered to the mailbox or created by the user. For more information, see the **More info** section in this article.

5. Click **Yes** to enable the archive mailbox.

   It might take a few moments to create the archive mailbox. When it's created, **Archive mailbox: enabled** is displayed in the details pane for the selected user. You might have to click **Refresh** ![Refresh icon.](../media/O365-MDM-Policy-RefreshIcon.gif) to update the information in the details pane.

> [!TIP]
> You can also bulk-enable archive mailboxes by selecting multiple users with disabled archive mailboxes (use the Shift or Ctrl keys). After selecting multiple mailboxes, click **Enable** in the details pane.

## Disable an archive mailbox

You can also use the **Archive** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to disable a user's archive mailbox. After you disable an archive mailbox, you can reconnect it to the user's primary mailbox within 30 days of disabling it. In this case, the original contents of the archive mailbox are restored. After 30 days, the contents of the original archive mailbox are permanently deleted and can't be recovered. So if you re-enable the archive more than 30 days after disabling it, a new archive mailbox is created.

The default archive policy assigned to users' mailboxes moves items to the archive mailbox two years after the date the item is delivered. If you disable a user's archive mailbox, no action will be taken on mailbox items and they will remain in the user's primary mailbox.

To disable an archive mailbox:

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 compliance center</a> and sign in.

2. In the left pane of the Microsoft 365 compliance center, click **Information governance**, and then click the **Archive** tab.

   The **Archive** page is displayed. The **Archive mailbox** column indicates whether an archive mailbox is enabled or disabled for each user.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Archive** page shows a maximum of 500 users.

3. In the list of mailboxes, select the user that you want to disable the archive mailbox for.

4. In the details pane, click **Disable**.

   A warning message is displayed saying that you'll have 30 days to re-enable the archive mailbox, and that after 30 days, all information in the archive will be permanently deleted.

5. Click **Yes** to disable the archive mailbox.

   It might take a few moments to disable the archive mailbox. When it's disabled, **Archive mailbox: disabled** is displayed in the details pane for the selected user. You might have to click **Refresh** ![Refresh icon.](../media/O365-MDM-Policy-RefreshIcon.gif) to update the information in the details pane.

> [!TIP]
> You can also bulk-disable archive mailboxes by selecting multiple users with enabled archive mailboxes (use the Shift or Ctrl keys). After selecting multiple mailboxes, click **Disable** in the details pane.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable archive mailboxes

You can also use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable archive mailboxes. The primary reason to use PowerShell is that you can quickly enable the archive mailbox for all users in your organization.

The first step is to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

After you're connected to Exchange Online, you can run the commands in the following sections to enable or disable archive mailboxes.

### Enable archive mailboxes

Run the following command to enable the archive mailbox for a single user.

```powershell
Enable-Mailbox -Identity <username> -Archive
```

Run the following command to enable the archive mailbox for all users in your organization (whose archive mailbox is currently not enabled).

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Filter {ArchiveGuid -Eq "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -AND RecipientTypeDetails -Eq "UserMailbox"} | Enable-Mailbox -Archive
```

### Disable archive mailboxes

Run the following command to disable the archive mailbox for a single user.

```powershell
Disable-Mailbox -Identity <username> -Archive
```

Run the following command to disable the archive mailbox for all users in your organization (whose archive mailbox is currently enabled).

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Filter {ArchiveGuid -Ne "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -AND RecipientTypeDetails -Eq "UserMailbox"} | Disable-Mailbox -Archive
```

## Run diagnostics on archive mailboxes

You can run an automated diagnostic check on a user's archive mailbox to identify any problems and suggested resolutions.

To run the diagnostic check, click the button below. 

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run Tests: Archive Mailbox](https://aka.ms/PillarArchiveMailbox)

![Run diagnostics on an archive mailbox.](../media/ArchiveMailboxDiagnostics.png)

A flyout page opens in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Enter the email address of the mailbox you want to check and click **Run Tests**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a Microsoft 365 global admin to use the archive mailbox diagnostic check. Also, this feature isn't available in Microsoft 365 Government clouds, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.

## Next steps

Consider enabling [auto-expanding archiving](autoexpanding-archiving.md) for additional storage space. For instructions, see [Enable auto-expanding archiving](enable-autoexpanding-archiving.md).
