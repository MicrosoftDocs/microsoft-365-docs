description: "Admins can set up a connector to import and archive data from Globanet's Webex Teams connector in Microsoft 365. This connector lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Microsoft 365 so you can use compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage your organization's third-party data."

# Set up a connector to archive Webex Teams data (preview)

Use a Globanet connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive data from Webex Teams to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Globanet provides a [Webex Teams](https://globanet.com/webex-teams/) connector that is configured to capture Webex Teams communication items and import them to Microsoft 365. The connector converts content from Webex Teams, such as 1:1 chats, group conversations, channel conversations, and attachments from your organization's Webex Teams account, to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After Webex Teams data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels, and communication compliance. Using a Webex Teams connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving Webex Teams data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive Webex Teams data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for Webex Teams data](../media/WebexTeamsConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with Webex Teams to set up and configure a Webex Teams site.

2. Once every 24 hours, Webex Teams items are copied to the Globanet Merge1 site. The connector also converts the Webex Teams items to an email message format.

3. The Webex Teams connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, connects to the Globanet Merge1 every day, and transfers the Webex Teams items to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports items to the mailboxes of specific users by using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **Webex Teams** is created in the user mailboxes, and the items are imported to that folder. The connector does this by using the value of the *Email* property. Every Webex Teams item contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant of the item.

## Before you begin

- Create a Globanet Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To do this, contact [Globanet Customer Support](https://globanet.com/ms-connectors-contact). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- Create an application at [https://developer.webex.com/](https://developer.webex.com) to fetch data from your Webex Teams account. For step-by step instructions about creating the application, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Webex%20Teams%20User%20Guide%20.pdf)

   When you create this application, the Webex platform generates a set of unique credentials. These credentials are used in Step 2 when you configure the Webex Teams connector on the Global Merge1 site.

- The user who creates the Webex Teams connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to any role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the Webex Teams connector

The first step is to gain access to the **Data Connectors** and set up the [Webex Teams](https://globanet.com/webex-teams/) connector.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** > **Webex Teams**.

2. On the **Webex Teams** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the Webex Teams connector on the Globanet Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the Webex Teams connector on the Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the Webex Teams connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Webex%20Teams%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, you are directed back to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, to the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map Webex Teams users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The Webex Teams items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. On the **Admin Consent** page, click the **Provide Consent** button. You will be redirected to the Microsoft site. Click **Accept** to provide the consent.
  
   Your organization must consent to allow the Office 365 Import service to access mailbox data in your organization. To provide admin consent, you must be signed in with the credentials of a Microsoft 365 global admin, and then accept the consent request. If you aren't signed in as a global admin, you can go to [this page](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=570d0bec-d001-4c4e-985e-3ab17fdc3073&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com/&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent) and sign in using global admin credentials to accept the request.

3. Click **Next**, review your settings, and then go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the Webex Teams connector

After you create the Webex Teams connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **Webex Teams** connector to display the flyout page, which contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments larger than 10 MB but support for larger items will be available at a later date.
