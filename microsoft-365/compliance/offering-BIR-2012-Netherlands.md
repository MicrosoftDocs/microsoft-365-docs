# Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Rijksdienst standard (BIR 2012)

## BIR 2012 overview

Organizations operating in the Netherlands government sector must demonstrate compliance with the Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Rijksdienst standard (BIR 2012). The BIR 2012 provides a standard framework based on ISO 27001 and ISO 27002. When using Microsoft Azure or Office 365, part of the BIR 2012 controls for these cloud services are managed by Microsoft in line with the shared responsibility model in cloud computing. Organizations that need to comply with BIR 2012 are therefore required to determine if the underlying Microsoft services they are using are compliant with BIR 2012.

The BIR coverage report provides guidance where the BIR standards are covered by existing ISO 27001 certifications that are available for the Microsoft Online Services. Where there are additional BIR controls that are not covered by ISO 27001, references are made to other independent attestations, audit documentation, or contractual statements.

## Microsoft and BIR 2012

While Microsoft is not subject to BIR 2012 compliance, customers from the government sector seeking to use cloud services can use Microsoft’s existing certifications to determine their compliance with this standard. Azure and Office 365 undergo various periodic independent certifications and attestations, some of which are closely related to BIR 2012.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is Microsoft BIR 2012 certified?**

The responsibility for BIR compliance is applicable to the government sector. It requires the organization to implement an information security management system and to address risk with appropriate technical and organizational measures. For Microsoft in its role as cloud service provider, BIR compliance is not the objective, nor is it technically feasible. When a customer implements or uses Microsoft Online Services, those services may be in scope of a BIR evaluation. However, the organization must add its own (additional) controls, choices, and processes, which are part of the overall BIR evaluation. The objective of the report is to demonstrate that a government agency can adopt the Microsoft Online Services in a manner that is compliant with BIR 2012.

**Is a customer that uses Microsoft Online Services compliant with BIR 2012?**

Demonstrating BIR compliance is the responsibility of the customer. When using a cloud services vendor, customers typically demand assurances from the vendor, and add their own (additional) technology and organizational decisions, choices, and processes. This results in an overall assessment by the customer on its BIR compliance, which can be submitted for review or certification to a third-party auditor. The BIR coverage report provides insight into what BIR controls are covered by Microsoft Online Services, but as such does not cover end-to-end compliance.

**The report does not show 100% coverage. Is BIR 2012 compliance not feasible?**

Microsoft Online Services provides many controls that help organizations within the Netherlands with their BIR compliance needs. However, an organization needs to complement those vendor assurances with their own implementation choices, additional technology controls, and administrative processes. The report shows already over 91% direct coverage of the full list of applicable controls. For the remaining controls, Microsoft provides guidance in the report on how compliance with those controls can be demonstrated.

**Is the BIR coverage report a legal binding document?**

No. It is a supporting tool for the customer’s internal BIR assurance process and helps to establish confidence and trust that BIR compliance is feasible. The report has a descriptive status and includes a legal disclaimer.

**Can we share this report?**

The report is provided to customers under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), on the basis that it is for customer information only and that it will not be copied or disclosed via other channels than the Microsoft [Service Trust Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/STP/default.aspx). Customers can share the report with their own internal or external auditor as part of their compliance or assurance processes.
