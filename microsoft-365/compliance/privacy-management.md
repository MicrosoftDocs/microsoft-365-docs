# Microsoft privacy management (preview)

## What is privacy management?

As your company’s cloud data grows in size and complexity, so does your need to understand and safeguard the personal data held in your environment. Privacy management in Microsoft 365 empowers your employees to make smart data handling decisions and address critical privacy risks by providing efficient ways to find and manage personal data, automate privacy operations, and fulfill subject rights requests. These solutions will enable you to build a privacy resilient workplace and handle issues at scale.

## Privacy management solutions

In today's data landscape, organizations must invest in managing and protecting the personal data they store. Privacy regulations around the world have established standards to follow and the rights of individuals to control their own personal information, and best practices for businesses are continually evolving to keep information about their employees and customers safe.

Microsoft 365 privacy management provides solutions that enable you to:

- **Find and visualize personal data**: Protecting data starts with having a thorough understanding of what your organization is storing, where it lives across the services you use, and the conditions under which it's managed in the long term.
- **Manage privacy risks**: Use privacy management to evaluate your data for key risk scenarios, and use built-in tools to set alerts and remediate issues like unintended oversharing, exposure, or unnecessary storage of personal information.
- **Efficiently fulfill personal data requests**: When individuals request to manage the personal data that you store about them, use the privacy management solution to collect data, review the findings, and produce reports.

Privacy management gives you tools to help you navigate these situations, automate key tasks, and easily manage your data handling workflows.

### Understand your data

With privacy management, you can gain insights into your organization's entire Microsoft 365 privacy landscape. The solution will evaluate your data for personal information, give you a clear view into what you store, and offer opportunities to investigate areas of key interest.

These insights are presented across your **Overview** dashboard, which provides dynamic updates about your data and important trends, and the **data profile**, which allows you to explore ongoing analytics. The findings and alerts here can inform your next actions for managing data.

To learn more, see [Find and visualize your personal data](privacy-management-data-profile.md).

### Manage risk scenarios

Complex data environments can present potentially risky scenarios for personal data. Privacy management provides easy ways to detect risks in the following areas and establish ongoing processes for handling these scenarios.

- **Overexposed personal data**: Companies may collect various types of information that can be used to identify individual customers or employees. Access rights to this data must be properly managed to protect privacy and prevent inappropriate use.
- **Data transfers**: Transferring personal data between departments in your organization or across country or regional borders may increase the risk of exposure of data, or of stepping out of accordance with privacy regulations and laws.
- **Data minimization**: Companies may collect excess information or keep it longer than necessary, resulting in storage of unused personal data. This data should be minimized to help prevent privacy risks.

Privacy management provides built-in templates for setting up data-handling policies in these areas. These policies can evaluate your Microsoft 365 data on an ongoing basis, alert you to potential issues, and help you remediate these issues. As a result, your employees can better follow best privacy practices and stay aware of recommended actions to take. The templates can either be used as provided or customized to meet your company’s specific needs.

To learn more, see [Create and manage policies](privacy-management-policies.md).

### Manage subject rights requests

In accordance with certain privacy regulations, for example General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, individuals may make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. For companies that store large amounts of information, finding the relevant data may seem like a formidable task.

Privacy management in Microsoft 365 can help you handle these inquiries through the subject rights request solution. It provides automation and workflow capabilities for helping you search for subject data that you’ve stored in Microsoft 365, review the findings, select the appropriate files, and produce reports. Along the way, you can securely collaborate with other experts in your organization to bring the request to completion.

To learn more, see [Manage subject rights requests](privacy-management-subject-rights-requests.md).

## How we evaluate your data

To show personal information in your Microsoft 365 environment and provide capabilities for managing that data and remediating issues, privacy management evaluates data within the following scope.

### What privacy management evaluates

- Sensitive information, which we call personal data and is the data supported by Microsoft data classification, for example, name, address, or Social Security number
- Personal data of people connected to your organization, such as customers and employees
- Data handling activities of employees who work with personal data, such as file owners and business operations staff

For more information about how Microsoft 365 defines sensitive information, see [Learn about sensitive information types](sensitive-information-type-learn-about.md).

### Where privacy management identifies personal data

The privacy management solution for Microsoft 365 evaluates data and files stored by your organization in Microsoft 365’s cloud service to help you identify and manage privacy risks in that space. This includes:

- Microsoft Exchange
- Microsoft SharePoint
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Microsoft Teams

Since privacy management focuses on data specific to your organization, any personal accounts your employees or customers may have on these services will not be in scope.
