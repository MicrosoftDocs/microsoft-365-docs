# About the free trial for Microsoft Compliance Manager premium assessments

Compliance Manager helps you manage your organization’s compliance requirements and assess and improve your compliance score. The assessments you build are based on templates that correspond to governmental regulations and industry standards around the world.  

Your licensing agreement to use Compliance Manager may include one or more built-in templates. An extensive library of premium assessment templates is also available for you to choose from so you can build assessments specific to your organization’s needs. To try out these templates before purchasing licenses, sign up for the free premium assessments trial.

## Terms and conditions

See the [terms and conditions](terms-conditions.md) for Microsoft 365 compliance trials.

## Set up a compliance trial

You can sign up for a trial in the Microsoft 365 compliance center using the **Trials** link in the left navigation pane. Select the **Compliance Manager premium assessment trial** to start a trial for premium assessment templates.

Full access to Compliance Manager features may depend on your licensing agreement for Compliance Manager. To learn more about the free compliance trial that includes Compliance Manager, see [About the free trial for Microsoft 365 compliance](compliance-easy-trials.md).

## Licensing

Starting your one-time trial for premium assessments gives you the right to use 25 premium templates of your choice for free for 90 days. You can create as many assessments as you wish using these 25 templates.

After you start your trial, go to your **Assessments** tab in Compliance Manager and view the **Activated/Licensed templates** counter to see how many templates are available and are in use. This counter will show your 25 licensed templates. As you create assessments using these templates, your activated number will update. Template use is counted based on the underlying certification, meaning that multiple assessments based on the same template will count as one template use.

For more details about how to use and manage Compliance Manager templates, see [Working with assessment templates](compliance-manager-templates.md).

## Permissions

Anyone in your organization with access to Compliance Manager can sign up for the assessment template trial.

## During your trial

Throughout your trial, you can review the **Trial summary** section of the **Overview** page in Compliance Manager to see how many assessments you’ve created, how many improvement actions you’ve taken, how that has contributed to your compliance score, and how much time remains in your trial. From here, you can also review the list of available templates and learn more about purchasing them for ongoing use.

## After the trial

After your trial ends, the assessment templates you selected will stop receiving automatic updates and may fall out of date with any regulatory changes. We recommend that you delete assessments built on templates that you don’t intend to purchase.
