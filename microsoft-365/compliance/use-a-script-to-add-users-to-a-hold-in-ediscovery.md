# Use a script to add users to a hold in a Core eDiscovery case

The Security & Compliance Center provides PowerShell cmdlets that let you automate time-consuming tasks related to creating and managing eDiscovery cases. Currently, using the eDiscovery case tool in the Security & Compliance Center to place a large number of custodian content locations on hold takes time and preparation. For example, before you create a hold, you have to collect the URL for each OneDrive for Business site that you want to place on hold. Then for each user you want to place on hold, you have to add their mailbox and their OneDrive for Business site to the hold. In future releases of the Security & Compliance Center, this will get easier to do. Until then, you can use the script in this article to automate this process.
  
The script prompts you for the name of your organization's My Site domain (for example, **contoso** in the URL https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com), the name of an existing eDiscovery case, the name of the new hold that associated with the case, a list of email addresses of the users you want to put on hold, and a search query to use if you want to create a query-based hold. The script then gets the URL for the OneDrive for Business site for each user in the list, creates the new hold, and then adds the mailbox and OneDrive for Business site for each user in the list to the hold. The script also generates log files that contain information about the new hold.
  
Here are the steps to make this happen:
  
[Step 1: Install the SharePoint Online Management Shell](#step-1-install-the-sharepoint-online-management-shell)
  
[Step 2: Generate a list of users](#step-2-generate-a-list-of-users)
  
[Step 3: Run the script to create a hold and add users](#step-3-run-the-script-to-create-a-hold-and-add-users)
  
## Before you add users to a hold

- You have to be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group in the Security & Compliance Center and a SharePoint Online administrator to run the script in Step 3. For more information, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Office‍ 365 Security & Compliance Center](assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).

- A maximum of 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites can be added to a hold that's associated with an eDiscovery case in the Security & Compliance Center. Assuming that every user that you want to place on hold has a OneDrive for Business site, you can add a maximum of 100 users to a hold using the script in this article.

- Be sure to save the list of users that you create in Step 2 and the script in Step 3 to the same folder. That will make it easier to run the script.

- The script adds the list of users to a new hold that is associated with an existing case. Be sure the case that you want to associate the hold with is created before you run the script.

- Each time you run the script, new Security & Compliance PowerShell and SharePoint Online PowerShell sessions are created. So you could use up all the PowerShell sessions available to you. To prevent this from happening, you can run the following commands to disconnect your active PowerShell sessions.

  ```powershell
  Get-PSSession | Remove-PSSession
  ```

   ```powershell
   Disconnect-SPOService
   ```

- The script includes minimal error handling. Its primary purpose is to quickly and easily place the mailbox and OneDrive for Business site of each user on hold.

- The sample scripts provided in this topic aren't supported under any Microsoft standard support program or service. The sample scripts are provided AS IS without warranty of any kind. Microsoft further disclaims all implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk arising out of the use or performance of the sample scripts and documentation remains with you. In no event shall Microsoft, its authors, or anyone else involved in the creation, production, or delivery of the scripts be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the sample scripts or documentation, even if Microsoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## Step 1: Install the SharePoint Online Management Shell

The first step is to install the SharePoint Online Management Shell if it's not already installed on your local computer. You don't have to use the shell in this procedure, but you have to install it because it contains pre-requisites required by the script that you run in Step 3. These prerequisites allow the script to communicate with SharePoint Online to get the URLs for the OneDrive for Business sites.
  
Go to [Set up the SharePoint Online Management Shell Windows PowerShell environment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=286318) and perform Step 1 and Step 2 to install the SharePoint Online Management Shell on your local computer. 

## Step 2: Generate a list of users

The script in Step 3 will create a hold that's associated with an eDiscovery case, and the add the mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites of a list of users to the hold. You can just type the email addresses in a text file, or you can run a command in Windows PowerShell to get a list of email addresses and save them to a file (located in same folder that you'll save the script to in Step 3).
  
Here's a PowerShell command (that you run by using remote PowerShell connected to your Exchange Online organization) to get a list of email addresses for all users in your organization and save it to a text file named HoldUsers.txt.
  
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter { RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox'} | Select-Object PrimarySmtpAddress > HoldUsers.txt
```

After you run this command, open the text file and remove the header that contains the property name,  `PrimarySmtpAddress`. Then remove all email addresses except the ones for the users that you want to add to the hold that you'll create in Step 3. Make sure there are no blank rows before or after the list of email addresses.
  
## Step 3: Run the script to create a hold and add users

When you run the script in this step, it will prompt you for the following information. Be sure to have this information ready before you run the script.
  
- **Your user credentials:** The script will use your credentials to connect to the Security & Compliance Center with remote PowerShell. It will also use these credentials to access SharePoint Online to get the OneDrive for Business URLs for the list of users.

- **Name of your My Site domain:** The My Site domain is the domain that contains all the OneDrive for Business sites in your organization. For example, if the URL for your My Site domain is **https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com**, then you would enter  `contoso` when the script prompts you for the name of your My Site domain.

- **Name of the case:** The name of an existing case. The script will create a new hold that is associated with this case.

- **Name of the hold:** The name of the hold the script will create and associate with the specified case.

- **Search query for a query-based hold:** You can create a query-based hold so that only the content that meets the specified search criteria is placed on hold. To place all content on hold, just press **Enter** when you're prompted for a search query.

- **Turning on the hold or not:** You can have the script turn on the hold after it's created or you can have the script create the hold without enabling it. If you don't have the script turn on the hold, you can turn it on later in the Security & Compliance Center or by running the following PowerShell commands:

  ```powershell
  Set-CaseHoldPolicy -Identity <name of the hold> -Enabled $true
  ```

  ```powershell
  Set-CaseHoldRule -Identity <name of the hold> -Disabled $false
  ```

- **Name of the text file with the list of users** - The name of the text file from Step 2 that contains the list of users to add to the hold. If this file is located in the same folder as the script, just type the name of the file (for example, HoldUsers.txt). If the text file is in another folder, type the full pathname of the file.

After you've collected the information that the script will prompt you for, the final step is to run the script to create the new hold and add users to it.
  
1. Save the following text to a Windows PowerShell script file by using a filename suffix of `.ps1`. For example, `AddUsersToHold.ps1`.

   ```

2. On your local computer, open Windows PowerShell and go to the folder where you saved the script.

3. Run the script; for example:

   ```powershell
   .\AddUsersToHold.ps1
   ```

4. Enter the information that the script prompts you for.

   The script connects to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell, and then creates the new hold in the eDiscovery case and adds the mailboxes and OneDrive for Business for the users in the list. You can go to the case on the **eDiscovery** page in the Security & Compliance Center to view the new hold. 

After the script is finished running, it creates the following log files, and saves them to the folder where the script is located.
  
- **LocationsOnHold.txt:** Contains a list of mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites that the script successfully placed on hold.

- **LocationsNotOnHold.txt:** Contains a list of mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites that the script did not place on hold. If a user has a mailbox, but not a OneDrive for Business site, the user would be included in the list of OneDrive for Business sites that weren't placed on hold.

- **GetCaseHoldPolicy.txt:** Contains the output of the **Get-CaseHoldPolicy** cmdlet for the new hold, which the script ran after creating the new hold. The information returned by this cmdlet includes a list of users whose mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites were placed on hold and whether the hold is enabled or disabled. 

- **GetCaseHoldRule.txt:** Contains the output of the **Get-CaseHoldRule** cmdlet for the new hold, which the script ran after creating the new hold. The information returned by this cmdlet includes the search query if you used the script to create a query-based hold.
