# Refresh your exact data match sensitive information source table file 

You can refresh your sensitive information database up to 5 times in every 24 hour period. You'll have to rehash and upload your sensitive information source table.

1. Re-export the sensitive data to an app, such as Microsoft Excel, and save the file in .csv, .tsv format or pipe (|) delimited format. Keep the same file name and location you used when you previously hashed and uploaded the file. See, [Export source data for exact data match based sensitive information type](sit-get-started-exact-data-match-export-data.md#export-source-data-for-exact-data-match-based-sensitive-information-type) for details on exporting your sensitive data and getting it into the correct format.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If there are no changes to the structure (field names) of the sensitive information source table file, you won't need to make any changes to your database schema file when you refresh the data. But if you must make changes, make sure to edit the database schema and your rule package accordingly. See, [Manage your exact data match schema](sit-use-exact-data-manage-schema.md#manage-your-exact-data-match-schema) for the steps to edit or remove a schema. See, [Create exact data match sensitive information type/rule package](sit-get-started-exact-data-match-create-rule-package.md#create-exact-data-match-sensitive-information-typerule-package) for the steps to edit or remove your EDM SIT/rule package.

2. Use the procedures in [Hash and upload the sensitive information source table for exact data match sensitive information types](sit-get-started-exact-data-match-hash-upload.md#hash-and-upload-the-sensitive-information-source-table-for-exact-data-match-sensitive-information-types) to upload your sensitive information table source file.

3. You can use [Task Scheduler](/windows/desktop/TaskSchd/task-scheduler-start-page) to automate the [Hash and upload the sensitive information source table for exact data match sensitive information types](sit-get-started-exact-data-match-hash-upload.md#hash-and-upload-the-sensitive-information-source-table-for-exact-data-match-sensitive-information-types) procedure. You can schedule tasks using several methods:

   |Method|What to do|
   |---|---|
   |PowerShell|See the [ScheduledTasks](/powershell/module/scheduledtasks/) documentation and the [example PowerShell script](#example-powershell-script-for-task-scheduler) in this article|
   |Task Scheduler API|See the [Task Scheduler](/windows/desktop/TaskSchd/using-the-task-scheduler) documentation|
   |Windows user interface|In Windows, click **Start**, and type Task Scheduler. Then, in the list of results, right-click **Task Scheduler**, and choose **Run as administrator**.|

## Example PowerShell script for Task Scheduler

This section includes an example PowerShell script you can use to schedule your tasks for hashing data and uploading the hashed data:

### Schedule hashing and upload in a combined step

```powershell
param(\[string\]$dataStoreName,\[string\]$fileLocation)
\# Assuming current user is also the user context to run the task
$user = "$env:USERDOMAIN\\$env:USERNAME"
$edminstallpath = 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\EdmUploadAgent\\'
$edmuploader = $edminstallpath + 'EdmUploadAgent.exe'
$csvext = '.csv'
$schemaext = '.xml'
\# Assuming file name is same as data store name and file is in .csv format
$dataFile = "$fileLocation\\$dataStoreName$csvext"
\# Assuming location to store hash file is same as the location of csv file
$hashLocation = $fileLocation
\# Assuming Schema file name is same as data store name
$schemaFile = "$fileLocation\\$dataStoreName$schemaext"
$uploadDataArgs = '/UploadData /DataStoreName ' + $dataStoreName + ' /DataFile ' + $dataFile + ' /HashLocation' + $hashLocation + ' /Schema ' + $schemaFile
\# Set up actions associated with the task
$actions = @()
$actions += New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $edmuploader -Argument $uploadDataArgs -WorkingDirectory $edminstallpath
\# Set up trigger for the task
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Sunday -At 2am
\# Set up task settings
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId $user -LogonType S4U -RunLevel Highest
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable -StartWhenAvailable -WakeToRun
\# Create the scheduled task
$scheduledTask = New-ScheduledTask -Action $actions -Principal $principal -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings
\# Get credentials to run the task
$creds = Get-Credential -UserName $user -Message "Enter credentials to run the task"
$password=\[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal\]::PtrToStringAuto(\[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal\]::SecureStringToBSTR($creds.Password))
\# Register the scheduled task
$taskName = 'EDMUpload\_' + $dataStoreName
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName -InputObject $scheduledTask -User $user -Password $password
```

### Schedule hashing and upload as separate steps

```powershell
param(\[string\]$dataStoreName,\[string\]$fileLocation)
\# Assuming current user is also the user context to run the task
$user = "$env:USERDOMAIN\\$env:USERNAME"
$edminstallpath = 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\EdmUploadAgent\\'
$edmuploader = $edminstallpath + 'EdmUploadAgent.exe'
$csvext = '.csv'
$edmext = '.EdmHash'
$schemaext = '.xml'
\# Assuming file name is same as data store name and file is in .csv format
$dataFile = "$fileLocation\\$dataStoreName$csvext"
$hashFile = "$fileLocation\\$dataStoreName$edmext"
\# Assuming Schema file name is same as data store name
$schemaFile = "$fileLocation\\$dataStoreName$schemaext "

\# Assuming location to store hash file is same as the location of csv file
$hashLocation = $fileLocation
$createHashArgs = '/CreateHash' + ' /DataFile ' + $dataFile + ' /HashLocation ' + $hashLocation + ' /Schema ' + $schemaFile
$uploadHashArgs = '/UploadHash /DataStoreName ' + $dataStoreName + ' /HashFile ' + $hashFile
\# Set up actions associated with the task
$actions = @()
$actions += New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $edmuploader -Argument $createHashArgs -WorkingDirectory $edminstallpath
$actions += New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $edmuploader -Argument $uploadHashArgs -WorkingDirectory $edminstallpath
\# Set up trigger for the task
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Sunday -At 2am
\# Set up task settings
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId $user -LogonType S4U -RunLevel Highest
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable -StartWhenAvailable -WakeToRun
\# Create the scheduled task
$scheduledTask = New-ScheduledTask -Action $actions -Principal $principal -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings
\# Get credentials to run the task
$creds = Get-Credential -UserName $user -Message "Enter credentials to run the task"
$password=\[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal\]::PtrToStringAuto(\[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal\]::SecureStringToBSTR($creds.Password))
\# Register the scheduled task
$taskName = 'EDMUpload\_' + $dataStoreName
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName -InputObject $scheduledTask -User $user -Password $password
```
