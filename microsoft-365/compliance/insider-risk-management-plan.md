# Plan for insider risk management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider risk management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

Before getting started with [insider risk management](insider-risk-management.md) in your organization, there are important planning activities and considerations that should be reviewed by your information technology and compliance management teams. Thoroughly understanding and planning for deployment in the following areas will help ensure that your implementation and use of insider risk management features goes smoothly and is aligned with best practices. 

For more information and an overview of the planning process to address risky activities in your organization, see [Starting an insider risk management program](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/2/0/b208282a-2482-4986-ba07-15a9b9286df0/pwc-starting-an-insider-risk-management-program-with-pwc-and-microsoft.pdf).

Watch the video below to learn how the insider risk management workflow can help your organization prevent, detect, and contain risks while prioritizing your organization values, culture, and user experience:

## Work with stakeholders in your organization

Identify the appropriate stakeholders in your organization to collaborate for taking actions on insider risk management alerts and cases. Some recommended stakeholders to consider including in initial planning and the end-to-end [insider risk management workflow](insider-risk-management.md#workflow) are people from the following areas of your organization:

- Information technology
- Compliance
- Privacy
- Security
- Human resources
- Legal

## Determine any regional compliance requirements

Different geographic and organizational areas may have compliance and privacy requirements that are different from other areas of your organization. Work with the stakeholders in these areas to ensure they understand the compliance and privacy controls in insider risk management and how they should be used across different areas of your organization. In some scenarios, compliance and privacy requirements might require policies that designate or restrict some stakeholders from investigations and cases based on the case for a user or regulatory or policy requirements for the area.

If you have requirements for specific stakeholders to be involved in case investigations that involve users in certain regions, roles, or divisions, you may want to implement separate (even if identical) [insider risk management policies](insider-risk-management-policies.md) targeting the different regions and populations. This configuration makes it easier for the right stakeholders to triage and manage cases that are relevant to their roles and regions. You may want to consider creating processes and policies for regions where investigators and reviewers speak the same language as the users, which can help streamline the escalation process for insider risk management alerts and cases.

## Plan for permissions to support the review and investigation workflow

Depending on how you want to manage insider risk management policies and alerts, you'll need to assign users to specific role groups to manage different sets of insider risk management features. You have the option to assign users with different compliance responsibilities to specific role groups to manage different areas of insider risk management features. Or you may decide to assign all user accounts for designated administrators, analysts, investigators, and viewers to the *Insider Risk Management* role group. For more information, see [Get started with insider risk management](insider-risk-management-configure.md#step-1-required-enable-permissions-for-insider-risk-management).

## Understand requirements and dependencies

Depending on how you plan to implement insider risk management policies, you need to have the proper Microsoft 365 licensing subscriptions and understand and plan for some solution prerequisites.

**Licensing:** Insider risk management is available as part of wide selection of Microsoft 365 licensing subscriptions. For details, see the [Getting started with insider risk management](insider-risk-management-configure.md#subscriptions-and-licensing) article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Insider risk management is currently available in tenants hosted in geographical regions and countries supported by Azure service dependencies. To verify that insider risk management is supported for your organization, see [Azure dependency availability by country/region](/troubleshoot/azure/general/dependency-availability-by-country).

If you don't have an existing Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 plan and want to try insider risk management, you can [add Microsoft 365](/office365/admin/try-or-buy-microsoft-365) to your existing subscription or [sign up for a trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise) of Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5.

**Policy template requirements:** Depending on the policy template you choose, you need to be sure you understand the following requirements and plan accordingly prior to configuring insider risk management in your organization:

- When using the **Data theft by departing users** template, you must configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector to periodically import resignation and termination date information for users in your organization. See the [Import data with the HR connector](import-hr-data.md) article for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector.
- When using the **Data leaks** template, you must configure at least one Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy to define sensitive information in your organization and to receive insider risk alerts for High Severity DLP policy alerts. See the [Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md) article for step-by-step guidance to configure DLP policies.
- When using the **Security policy violation** template, you must enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration in the Defender Security Center to import security violation alerts. For step-by-step guidance to enable Defender for Endpoint integration with insider risk management, see [Configure advanced features in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features).
- When using the **Risky user** template, you must configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector to periodically import performance or demotion status information for users in your organization. See the [Import data with the HR connector](import-hr-data.md) article for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector.

## Test with a small group of users in a production environment

Before enabling this solution broadly in your production environment, you should consider testing the policies with a small set of production users while conducting for the necessary compliance, privacy, and legal reviews in your organization. Evaluating insider risk management in a test environment requires that you generate simulated user actions and other signals to create alerts for triage and cases for processing. This approach may not be practical for many organizations, so we recommended that you test insider risk management with a small group of users in a production environment.

Keep the anonymization feature in policy settings enabled to anonymize user display names in the insider risk management console during this testing to maintain privacy within the tool. This setting helps protect the privacy of users that have policy matches and can help promote objectivity in data investigation and analysis reviews for insider risk alerts.

If you don't see any alerts immediately after configuring an insider risk management policy, it may mean the minimum risk threshold hasn't been met yet. Check the **Users** page to verify that the policy is triggered and working as expected and to see if users are in-scope for the policy.

## Resources for stakeholders

Share insider risk management documentation with the stakeholders in your organization that are included in your management and remediation workflow:

- [Create and manage insider risk policies](insider-risk-management-policies.md)
- [Investigate insider risk activities](insider-risk-management-activities.md)
