# Document metadata fields in Data Investigations (Preview)

The following table lists the metadata fields for documents in a evidence set in an investigation in Data Investigations (Preview). The table indicates the name of the metadata field, whether the field can be searched when running a query in an evidence set, whether the field is present when viewing the file metadata of a selected document in an evidence set, and whether the field is included when documents are exported. 

> [!NOTE]
> The values in parentheses in the **Searchable in evidence set** column is the name of the property that you can search for. The values in parentheses in the **Viewable in file metadata** column is the name of the property that's displayed when you're viewing the file metadata.
