## Description

This named entity SIT matches personal names that a human would identify as a name with high confidence. For example, if a string is found consisting of a given name and is followed by a family name then a match is made with high confidence. It uses three primary resources:

- A dictionary of given names.
- A dictionary of family names.
- Patterns of how names are formed.

The three resources are different for each country.  The strings *Olivia Wilson* would trigger a match. Common given/family names are given a higher confidence than rarer names. However, the pattern also allows partial matches. If a given name from the dictionary is found and it's followed by a family name that isn't in the dictionary, then a partial match is triggered. For example, *Tomas Richard* would trigger a partial match. Partial matches are given lower confidence.

In addition, patterns that a human would see as indicative of names are also matched with appropriate confidence. Like *O. Wilson*, *O.P. Wilson*, *Dr. O. P. Wilson*, *Wilson, O.P.* or *T. Richard, Jr.* would be matches.
