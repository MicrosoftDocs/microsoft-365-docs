# Close or delete an investigation

## Close an investigation

 After you've completed the investigation and taken appropriate remedial actions, you may want to preserve the evidence that you collected but close the case so that you can easily refer back to it in the future. Once you close the investigation, it's still listed on the Data investigations page in the Security & Compliance Center. The details, holds, searches, and members of a closed case are retained. At a later date, you can reopen closed investigations.

To close an investigation:

1. On the **Settings** tab, select **Investigation information**.

2. Select  **Close investigation**. 


## Delete an investigation

Sometimes you may want to destroy the evidence because it contains sensitive or confidential data that you don't want to keep. To avoid further data spillage, you should consider deleting the investigation.

To delete an investigation:

1. On the **Settings** tab, select **Investigation information**.

2. Select **Delete investigation**.
