# Quick setup for Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery

This setup section shows an Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center eDiscovery manager how to get started with Advanced eDiscovery. A working knowledge of both is assumed.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
## Accessing a case in Advanced eDiscovery


You access Advanced eDiscovery from the Security &amp; Compliance Center. You have to be a member of an eDiscovery case in the Security &amp; Compliance Center to access the case in Advanced eDiscovery. For instructions about assigning eDiscovery case permissions and adding users to an eDiscovery case, see [Manage eDiscovery cases in Office 365](ediscovery-cases.md). 
  
To go to a case in Advanced eDiscovery: 
  
1. [Go to the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](go-to-the-securitycompliance-center.md) . 
    
2. In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, click **Search &amp; investigation** \> **eDiscovery** to display the list of cases in your organization. 
    
3. On the **eDiscovery** page, click **Open** next to the case that you want to go to in Advanced eDiscovery. 
    
4. On the **Home** page for the case, click **Advanced eDiscovery**.
    
    The **Connecting to Advanced eDiscovery** progress bar is displayed. When you're connected, the case is opened in Advanced eDiscovery.
