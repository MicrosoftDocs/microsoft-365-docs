## Create a review set

Review sets can be created on the **Review sets** tab by selecting **+ Add review set**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete items from a review set and you can't delete review sets from a case. To delete a review set (and delete the data in it), you have to delete the eDiscovery (Premium) case the review set is located in. For more information, see [Close or delete an eDiscovery (Premium) case](ediscovery-close-or-delete-case.md).
