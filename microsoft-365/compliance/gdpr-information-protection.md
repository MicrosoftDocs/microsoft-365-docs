# Information protection for GDPR with Microsoft 365 capabilities

Microsoft 365 provides a rich set of capabilities to help you achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This article summarizes recommended capabilities with links to more information.

For more information about how Microsoft can help you with the GDPR, see [Get Started: Support for GDPR Accountability](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRGetStarted) in the Service Trust Portal.

## Information protection

Office 365 provides a rich set of data governance capabilities. For help with finding, classifying, protecting, and monitoring personal data, see [Office 365 Information Protection for GDPR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/office-365-information-protection-for-gdpr). 

For help with on-premises servers, including file shares, SharePoint Server, Exchange Server, Skype for Business Server, Project Server, and Office Online Server, see [GDPR for on-premises Office servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/gdpr-for-office-servers). 

## Identity and access management

Azure Active Directory and other Microsoft 365 capabilities provide a rich set of capabilities to protect access to your data from identities and devices:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Conditional access
- Privileged identity management
- Mobile device management
- Mobile application management
- Hardwar protection for credentials

Microsoft provides a recommended configuration you can use as a starting point:
- [Identity and device access configurations](../enterprise/identity-device-policies.md): Recommended policy configurations to achieve three tiers of protection (baseline, sensitive, highly regulated). This guidance includes recommended policies for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online (including OneDrive for Business).
- [Security guidance for political campaigns, nonprofits, and other agile organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/microsoft-security-guidance-for-political-campaigns-nonprofits-and-other-agile-o): This includes the same set of policies but provides additional guidance for BYOD environments and for B2B accounts.
