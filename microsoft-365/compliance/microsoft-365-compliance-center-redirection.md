# Redirection of users from the Office 365 Security and Compliance center to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

[!include[Purview banner](../includes/purview-rebrand-banner.md)]

This article explains how automatic redirection works for users accessing compliance solutions from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center (protection.office.com) to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.

## What to expect

Automatic redirection is enabled by default for all users accessing compliance-related solutions in Office 365 Security and Compliance (protection.office.com):

- [Advanced eDiscovery](overview-ediscovery-20.md)
- [Communication compliance](communication-compliance.md)
- [Content search](search-for-content.md)
- [Core eDiscovery](get-started-core-ediscovery.md)
- [Data classification](data-classification-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md)
- [Data subject requests](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-manage-gdpr-data-subject-requests-with-the-dsr-case-tool)
- [Information governance](manage-information-governance.md)
- [Records management](records-management.md)

Users are automatically routed to the same compliance solutions in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.

This feature and associated controls does not enable the automatic redirection of Security features for Microsoft Defender for Office 365. To enable the redirection for security features, see [Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-mdo-redirection) for details.
