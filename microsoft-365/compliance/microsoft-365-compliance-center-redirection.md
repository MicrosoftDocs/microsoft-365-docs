# Redirection of users from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

This article explains how automatic redirection works for users accessing compliance solutions from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center (protection.office.com) to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

## What to expect

Automatic redirection is enabled by default for all users accessing compliance-related solutions in Office 365 Security and Compliance (protection.office.com):

- [eDiscovery (Premium)](overview-ediscovery-20.md)
- [Communication compliance](communication-compliance.md)
- [Content search](search-for-content.md)
- [eDiscovery (Standard)](get-started-core-ediscovery.md)
- [Data classification](data-classification-overview.md)
- [Data loss prevention (DLP)](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md)
- [Data subject requests](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-manage-gdpr-data-subject-requests-with-the-dsr-case-tool)
- [Data lifecycle management](manage-data-governance.md) (formerly **Information governance**)
- [Records management](records-management.md)

Users are automatically routed to the same compliance solutions in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">compliance portal</a>.

This feature and associated controls does not enable the automatic redirection of Security features for Microsoft Defender for Office 365. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mdo).
