# Redirection of users from the Office 365 Security and Compliance center to the Microsoft 365 compliance center

This article explains how automatic redirection works for users accessing compliance solutions from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center (protection.office.com) to the Microsoft 365 compliance center (compliance.microsoft.com).

## What to expect

Automatic redirection is enabled by default for all users accessing compliance-related solutions in Office 365 Security and Compliance (protection.office.com):

- [Advanced eDiscovery](overview-ediscovery-20.md)
- [Communication compliance](communication-compliance.md)
- [Content search](search-for-content.md)
- [Core eDiscovery](get-started-core-ediscovery.md)
- [Data classification](data-classification-overview.md)
- [Data loss prevention (DLP)](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md)
- [Data subject requests](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-manage-gdpr-data-subject-requests-with-the-dsr-case-tool)
- [Information governance](manage-information-governance.md)
- [Records management](records-management.md)

Users are automatically routed to the same compliance solutions in the Microsoft 365 compliance center (compliance.microsoft.com).

This feature and associated controls does not enable the automatic redirection of Security features for Microsoft Defender for Office 365. To enable the redirection for security features, see [Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to the Microsoft 365 security center](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-mdo-redirection) for details.
