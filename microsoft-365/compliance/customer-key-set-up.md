# Set up Customer Key

With Customer Key, you control your organization's encryption keys and then configure Microsoft 365 to use them to encrypt your data at rest in Microsoft's data centers. In other words, Customer Key allows customers to add a layer of encryption that belongs to them, with their keys. Data at rest includes data from Exchange Online and Skype for Business that is stored in mailboxes and files that are stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.

You must set up Azure before you can use Customer Key for Office 365. This topic describes the steps you need to follow to create and configure the required Azure resources and then provides the steps for setting up Customer Key in Office 365. After you have completed Azure setup, you determine which policy, and therefore, which keys, to assign to mailboxes and files in your organization. Mailboxes and files for which you don't assign a policy will use encryption policies that are controlled and managed by Microsoft. For more information about Customer Key, or for a general overview, see [Service encryption with Customer Key in Office 365](customer-key-overview.md).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend that you follow the best practices in this topic. These are called out as **TIP** and **IMPORTANT**. Customer Key gives you control over root encryption keys whose scope can be as large as your entire organization. This means that mistakes made with these keys can have a broad impact and may result in service interruptions or irrevocable loss of your data.
  
## Before you set up Customer Key

Before you get started, ensure that you have the appropriate licensing for your organization. Starting April 1, 2020, Customer Key in Office 365 is offered in Office 365 E5, M365 E5, M365 E5 Compliance, and M365 E5 Information Protection & Governance SKUs. Office 365 Advanced Compliance SKU is no longer available for procuring new licenses. Customers with existing Office 365 Advanced Compliance licenses will continue to be supported.

To understand the concepts and procedures in this topic, review the [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) documentation. Also, become familiar with the terms used in Azure, for example, [tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/azure-services/jj573650(v=azure.100)).

FastTrack is only used to collect the required tenant and service configuration information used to register for Customer Key. The Customer Key Offers are published via FastTrack so that it is convenient for you and our partners to submit the required information using the same method. FastTrack also makes it easy to archive the data that you provide in the Offer.
  
If you need additional support beyond the documentation, contact Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS), Premier Field Engineering (PFE), or a Microsoft partner for assistance. To provide feedback on Customer Key, including the documentation, send your ideas, suggestions, and perspectives to customerkeyfeedback@microsoft.com.
  
## Overview of steps to set up Customer Key

To set up Customer Key, complete these tasks in the listed order. The rest of this article provides detailed instructions for each task, or links out to more information for each step in the process.
  
**In Azure and Microsoft FastTrack:**
  
You will complete most of these tasks by remotely connecting to Azure PowerShell. For best results, use version 4.4.0 or later of Azure PowerShell.
  
- [Create two new Azure subscriptions](#create-two-new-azure-subscriptions)

- [Register Azure subscriptions to use a mandatory retention period](#register-azure-subscriptions-to-use-a-mandatory-retention-period)

  Registration can take from one to five business days.

- [Submit a request to activate Customer Key for Office 365](#submit-a-request-to-activate-customer-key-for-office-365)

Once you've created the two new Azure subscriptions, you'll need to submit the appropriate Customer Key offer request by completing a web form that is hosted in the Microsoft FastTrack portal. **The FastTrack team doesn't provide assistance with Customer Key. Office simply uses the FastTrack portal to allow you to submit the form and to help us track the relevant offers for Customer Key**.

## Complete tasks in Azure Key Vault and Microsoft FastTrack for Customer Key

Complete these tasks in Azure Key Vault. You will need to complete these steps regardless of whether you intend to set up Customer Key for Exchange Online and Skype for Business or for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files, or for all supported services in Office 365.
  
### Create two new Azure subscriptions

Customer Key requires two Azure subscriptions. As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that you create new Azure subscriptions for use with Customer Key. Azure Key Vault keys can only be authorized for applications in the same Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant, you must create the new subscriptions using the same Azure AD tenant used with your organization where the DEPs will be assigned. For example, using your work or school account that has global administrator privileges in your organization. For detailed steps, see [Sign up for Azure as an organization](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer Key requires two keys for each data encryption policy (DEP). In order to achieve this, you must create two Azure subscriptions. As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that you have separate members of your organization configure one key in each subscription. In addition, these Azure subscriptions should only be used to administer encryption keys for Office 365. This protects your organization in case one of your operators accidentally, intentionally, or maliciously deletes or otherwise mismanages the keys for which they are responsible. <br/> We recommend that you set up new Azure subscriptions that are solely used for managing Azure Key Vault resources for use with Customer Key. There is no practical limit to the number of Azure subscriptions that you can create for your organization. Following these best practices will minimize the impact of human error while helping to manage the resources used by Customer Key.
  
### Submit a request to activate Customer Key for Office 365

Once you've completed the Azure steps, you'll need to submit an offer request in the [Microsoft FastTrack portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/). Once you have submitted a request through the FastTrack web portal, Microsoft verifies the Azure Key Vault configuration data and contact information you provided. The selections that you make in the offer form regarding the authorized officers of your organization is critical and necessary for completion of Customer Key registration. The officers of your organization that you select in the form will be the used to ensure the authenticity of any request to revoke and destroy all keys used with a Customer Key data encryption policy. You'll need to do this step once to activate Customer Key for Exchange Online and Skype for Business coverage and a second time to activate Customer Key for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.
  
To submit an offer to activate Customer Key, complete these steps:
  
1. Using a work or school account that has global administrator permissions in your organization, log in to the [Microsoft FastTrack portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/).

2. Once you're logged in, browse to the **Dashboard**.

3. Choose **Deploy** from the navigation bar **OR** select **View all deployment resources** on the **Deploy** information card, and review the list of current offers.

4. Choose the information card for the offer that applies to you:

   - **Exchange Online and Skype for Business:** Choose the **Request encryption key help for Exchange online** offer.

   - **SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams files:** Choose the **Request encryption key help for Sharepoint and OneDrive** offer.

5. Once you've reviewed the offer details, choose **Continue to step 2**.

6. Fill out all applicable details and requested information on the offer form. Pay particular attention to your selections for which officers of your organization you want to authorize to approve the permanent and irreversible destruction of encryption keys and data. Once you've completed the form, choose **Submit**.

### Register Azure subscriptions to use a mandatory retention period

The temporary or permanent loss of root encryption keys can be very disruptive or even catastrophic to service operation and can result in data loss. For this reason, the resources used with Customer Key require strong protection. All the Azure resources that are used with Customer Key offer protection mechanisms beyond the default configuration. Azure subscriptions can be tagged or registered in a way that will prevent immediate and irrevocable cancellation. This is referred to as registering for a mandatory retention period. The steps required to register Azure subscriptions for a mandatory retention period require collaboration with the Microsoft 365 team. This process can take from one to five business days. Previously, this was sometimes referred to as "Do Not Cancel".
  
Before contacting the Microsoft 365 team, you must perform the following steps for each Azure subscription that you use with Customer Key. Ensure that you have the [Azure PowerShell Az](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) module installed before you start.
  
1. Sign in with Azure PowerShell. For instructions, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. Run the Register-AzProviderFeature cmdlet to register your subscriptions to use a mandatory retention period. Perform this action for each subscription.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
   Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName mandatoryRetentionPeriodEnabled -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.KeyVault
   ```

3. Contact Microsoft to have the process finalized. For the SharePoint and OneDrive for Business team, contact [spock@microsoft.com](mailto:spock@microsoft.com). For Exchange Online and Skype for Business, contact [exock@microsoft.com](mailto:exock@microsoft.com). Include the following in your email:

   **Subject**: Customer Key for \<*Your tenant's fully-qualified domain name*\>

   **Body**:
   Subscription IDs for which you want to have the mandatory retention period finalized.
   The output of Get-AzProviderFeature for each subscription.

   The Service Level Agreement (SLA) for completion of this process is five business days once Microsoft has been notified (and verified) that you have registered your subscriptions to use a mandatory retention period.

4. Once you receive notification from Microsoft that registration is complete, verify the status of your registration by running the Get-AzProviderFeature command as follows. If verified, the Get-AzProviderFeature command returns a value of **Registered** for the **Registration State** property. Perform this action for each subscription.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
   Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Resources -FeatureName mandatoryRetentionPeriodEnabled
   ```

5. To complete the process, run the Register-AzResourceProvider command. Perform this action for each subscription.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.KeyVault
   ```

### Create a premium Azure Key Vault in each subscription

The steps to create a key vault are documented in [Getting Started with Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/), which guides you through installing and launching Azure PowerShell, connecting to your Azure subscription, creating a resource group, and creating a key vault in that resource group.
  
When you create a key vault, you must choose a SKU: either Standard or Premium. The Standard SKU allows Azure Key Vault keys to be protected with software - there is no Hardware Security Module (HSM) key protection - and the Premium SKU allows the use of HSMs for protection of Key Vault keys. Customer Key accepts key vaults that use either SKU, though Microsoft strongly recommends that you use only the Premium SKU. The cost of operations with keys of either type is the same, so the only difference in cost is the cost per month for each HSM-protected key. See [Key Vault pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/) for details.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the Premium SKU key vaults and HSM-protected keys for production data, and only use Standard SKU key vaults and keys for testing and validation purposes.
  
For each Microsoft 365 service with which you will use Customer Key, create a key vault in each of the two Azure subscriptions that you created. For example, for Exchange Online and Skype for Business only or SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business only, you will create only one pair of vaults. To enable Customer Key for both Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, you will create two pairs of key vaults.
  
Use a naming convention for key vaults that reflects the intended use of the data encryption policy with which you will associate the vaults. See the Best Practices section below for naming convention recommendations.
  
Create a separate, paired set of vaults for each data encryption policy. For Exchange Online, the scope of a data encryption policy is chosen by you when you assign the policy to mailbox. A mailbox can have only one policy assigned, and you can create up to fifty policies. For SharePoint Online the scope of a policy is all of the data within an organization in a geographic location, or _geo_.

The creation of key vaults also requires the creation of Azure resource groups, since key vaults need storage capacity (though very small) and Key Vault logging, if enabled, also generates stored data. As a best practice Microsoft recommends using separate administrators to manage each resource group, with the administration aligned with the set of administrators that will manage all related Customer Key resources.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maximize availability, your key vaults should be in regions close to your Microsoft 365 service. For example, if your Exchange Online organization is in North America, place your key vaults in North America. If your Exchange Online organization is in Europe, place your key vaults in Europe.<br/>Use a common prefix for key vaults, and include an abbreviation of the use and scope of the key vault and keys (e.g., for the Contoso SharePoint service where the vaults will be located in North America, a possible pair of names is Contoso-O365SP-NA-VaultA1 and Contoso-O365SP-NA-VaultA2. Vault names are globally unique strings within Azure, so you may need to try variations of your desired names in case the desired names are already claimed by other Azure customers. As of July 2017 vault names cannot be changed, so a best practice is to have a written plan for setup and use a second person to verify the plan is executed correctly.<br/>If possible, create your vaults in non-paired regions. Paired Azure regions provide high availability across service failure domains. Therefore, regional pairs can be thought of as each other's backup region. This means that an Azure resource that is placed in one region is automatically gaining fault tolerance through the paired region. For this reason, choosing regions for two vaults used in a data encryption policy where the regions are paired means that only a total of two regions of availability are in use. Most geographies only have two regions, so it's not yet possible to select non-paired regions. If possible, choose two non-paired regions for the two vaults used with a data encryption policy. This benefits from a total of four regions of availability. For more information, see [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) for a current list of regional pairs.
  
### Assign permissions to each key vault

For each key vault, you will need to define three separate sets of permissions for Customer Key, depending on your implementation. For example, you will need to define one set of permissions for each of the following:
  
- **Key vault administrators** that will perform day-to-day management of your key vault for your organization. These tasks include backup, create, get, import, list, and restore.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The set of permissions assigned to key vault administrators does not include the permission to delete keys. This is intentional and an important practice. Deleting encryption keys is not typically done, since doing so permanently destroys data. As a best practice, do not grant this permission to key vault administrators by default. Instead, reserve this for key vault contributors and only assign it to an administrator on a short term basis once a clear understanding of the consequences is understood.
  
  To assign these permissions to a user in your organization, log in to your Azure subscription with Azure PowerShell. For instructions, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

- Run the Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy cmdlet to assign the necessary permissions.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName <vault name> -UserPrincipalName <UPN of user> -PermissionsToKeys create,import,list,get,backup,restore
   ```

   For example:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 -UserPrincipalName alice@contoso.com -PermissionsToKeys create,import,list,get,backup,restore
   ```

- **Key vault contributors** that can change permissions on the Azure Key Vault itself. You'll need to change these permissions as employees leave or join your team, or in the extremely rare situation that the key vault administrators legitimately need permission to delete or restore a key. This set of key vault contributors needs to be granted the **Contributor** role on your key vault. You can assign this role by using Azure Resource Manager. For detailed steps, see [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure). The administrator who creates a subscription has this access implicitly, as well as the ability to assign other administrators to the Contributor role.

- If you intend to use Customer Key with Exchange Online and Skype for Business, you need to give permission to Microsoft 365 to use the key vault on behalf of Exchange Online and Skype for Business. Likewise, if you intend to use Customer Key with SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, you need to add permission for the Microsoft 365 to use the key vault on behalf of SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. To give permission to Microsoft 365, run the **Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy** cmdlet using the following syntax: 

   ```powershell
   Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName <vault name> -PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName <Office 365 appID>
   ```

   Where:

    - *vault name* is the name of the key vault you created.

    - For Exchange Online and Skype for Business, replace  *Office 365 appID* with `00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000`

    - For SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files, replace  *Office 365 appID* with `00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000`

  Example: Setting permissions for Exchange Online and Skype for Business:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 -PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName 00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000
   ```

  Example: Setting permissions for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName Contoso-O365SP-NA-VaultA1 -PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName 00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000
   ```

### Enable and then confirm soft delete on your key vaults

When you can quickly recover your keys, you are less likely to experience an extended service outage due to accidentally or maliciously deleted keys. You need to enable this configuration, referred to as Soft Delete, before you can use your keys with Customer Key. Enabling Soft Delete allows you to recover keys or vaults within 90 days of deletion without having to restore them from backup.
  
To enable Soft Delete on your key vaults, complete these steps:
  
1. Sign in to your Azure subscription with Windows Powershell. For instructions, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. Run the [Get-AzKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvault) cmdlet. In this example, *vault name* is the name of the key vault for which you are enabling soft delete:

   ```powershell
   $v = Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vault name>
   $r = Get-AzResource -ResourceId $v.ResourceId
   $r.Properties | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name enableSoftDelete -Value 'True'
   Set-AzResource -ResourceId $r.ResourceId -Properties $r.Properties
   ```

3. Confirm soft delete is configured for the key vault by running the **Get-AzKeyVault** cmdlet. If soft delete is configured properly for the key vault, then the _Soft Delete Enabled_ property returns a value of **True**:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vault name> | fl
   ```

### Add a key to each key vault either by creating or importing a key

There are two ways to add keys to an Azure Key Vault; you can create a key directly in Key Vault, or you can import a key. Creating a key directly in Key Vault is the less complicated method, while importing a key provides total control over how the key is generated.
  
To create a key directly in your key vault, run the [Add-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/add-azkeyvaultkey) cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name> -Name <key name> -Destination <HSM|Software> -KeyOps wrapKey,unwrapKey
```

Where:

- *vault name* is the name of the key vault in which you want to create the key.

- *key name* is the name you want to give the new key.

  > [!TIP]
  > Name keys using a similar naming convention as described above for key vaults. This way, in tools that show only the key name, the string is self-describing.
  
- If you intend to protect the key with an HSM, ensure that you specify **HSM** as the value of the _Destination_ parameter, otherwise, specify **Software**.

For example,
  
```powershell
Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 -Name Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1-Key001 -Destination Software -KeyOps wrapKey,unwrapKey
```

To import a key directly into your key vault, you need to have a Thales nShield Hardware Security Module.
  
Some organizations prefer this approach to establish the provenance of their keys, and the this method also provides the following:
  
- The tool set used for import includes attestation from Thales that the Key Exchange Key (KEK) that is used to encrypt the key you generate is not exportable and is generated inside a genuine HSM that was manufactured by Thales.

- The tool set includes attestation from Thales that the Azure Key Vault security world was also generated on a genuine HSM manufactured by Thales. This attestation proves to you that Microsoft is also using genuine Thales hardware.

Check with your security group to determine if the above attestations are required. For detailed steps to create a key on-premises and import it into your key vault, see [How to generate and transfer HSM-protected keys for Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/key-vault-hsm-protected-keys/). Use the Azure instructions to create a key in each key vault.
  
### Check the recovery level of your keys

Microsoft 365 requires that the Azure Key Vault subscription is set to Do Not Cancel and that the keys used by Customer Key have soft delete enabled. You can confirm this by looking at the recovery level on your keys.
  
To check the recovery level of a key, in Azure PowerShell, run the Get-AzKeyVaultKey cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
(Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name> -Name <key name>).Attributes
```

If the _Recovery Level_ property returns anything other than a value of **Recoverable+ProtectedSubscription**, you will need to review this topic and ensure that you have followed all of the steps to put the subscription on the Do Not Cancel list and that you have soft delete enabled on each of your key vaults.
  
### Back up Azure Key Vault

Immediately following creation or any change to a key, perform a backup and store copies of the backup, both online and offline. Offline copies should not be connected to any network, such as in a physical safe or commercial storage facility. At least one copy of the backup should be stored in a location that will be accessible in the event of a disaster. The backup blobs are the sole means of restoring key material should a Key Vault key be permanently destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable. Keys that are external to Azure Key Vault and were imported to Azure Key Vault do not qualify as a backup because the metadata necessary for Customer Key to use the key does not exist with the external key. Only a backup taken from Azure Key Vault can be used for restore operations with Customer Key. Therefore, it is essential that a backup of Azure Key Vault be made once a key is uploaded or created.
  
To create a backup of an Azure Key Vault key, run the [Backup-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/backup-azkeyvaultkey) cmdlet as follows:

```powershell
Backup-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name> -Name <key name>
-OutputFile <filename.backup>
```

Ensure that your output file uses the suffix `.backup`.
  
The output file resulting from this cmdlet is encrypted and cannot be used outside of Azure Key Vault. The backup can be restored only to the Azure subscription from which the backup was taken.
  
> [!TIP]
> For the output file, choose a combination of your vault name and key name. This will make the file name self-describing. It will also ensure that backup file names do not collide.
  
For example:
  
```powershell
Backup-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 -Name Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1-Key001 -OutputFile Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1-Key001-Backup-20170802.backup
```

### Validate Azure Key Vault configuration settings

Performing validation before using keys in a DEP is optional, but highly recommended. In particular, if you use steps to set up your keys and vaults other than the ones described in this topic, you should validate the health of your Azure Key Vault resources before you configure Customer Key.
  
To verify that your keys have get, wrapKey, and unwrapKey operations enabled:
  
Run the [Get-AzKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvault) cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vault name>
```

In the output, look for the Access Policy and for the Exchange Online identity (GUID) or the SharePoint Online identity (GUID) as appropriate. All three of the above permissions must be shown under Permissions to Keys.
  
If the access policy configuration is incorrect, run the Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName <vault name> -PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName <Office 365 appID>
```

For example, for Exchange Online and Skype for Business:
  
```powershell
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 
-PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName 00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000
```

For example, for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business:
  
```powershell
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName Contoso-O365SP-NA-VaultA1
-PermissionsToKeys wrapKey,unwrapKey,get -ServicePrincipalName TBD
```

To verify that an expiration date is not set for your keys run the [Get-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvault) cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name>
```

An expired key cannot be used by Customer Key and operations attempted with an expired key will fail, and possibly result in a service outage. We strongly recommend that keys used with Customer Key do not have an expiration date. An expiration date, once set, cannot be removed, but can be changed to a different date. If a key must be used that has an expiration date set, change the expiration value to 12/31/9999. Keys with an expiration date set to a date other than 12/31/9999 will not pass Microsoft 365 validation.
  
To change an expiration date that has been set to any value other than 12/31/9999, run the [Update-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/update-azkeyvaultkey) cmdlet as follows:
  
```powershell
Update-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name> -Name <key name> -Expires (Get-Date -Date "12/31/9999")
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't set expiration dates on encryption keys you use with Customer Key.
  
### Obtain the URI for each Azure Key Vault key

Once you've completed all the steps in Azure to set up your key vaults and added your keys, run the following command to get the URI for the key in each key vault. You will need to use these URIs when you create and assign each DEP later, so save this information in a safe place. Remember to run this command once for each key vault.
  
In Azure PowerShell:
  
```powershell
(Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <vault name>).Id
```

## Office 365: Setting up Customer Key for Exchange Online and Skype for Business

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the tasks required to set up Azure Key Vault. See [Complete tasks in Azure Key Vault and Microsoft FastTrack for Customer Key](#complete-tasks-in-azure-key-vault-and-microsoft-fasttrack-for-customer-key) for information.
  
To set up Customer Key for Exchange Online and Skype for Business, you will need to perform these steps by remotely connecting to Exchange Online with Windows PowerShell.
  
### Create a data encryption policy (DEP) for use with Exchange Online and Skype for Business

A DEP is associated with a set of keys stored in Azure Key Vault. You assign a DEP to a mailbox in Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 will then use the keys identified in the policy to encrypt the mailbox. To create the DEP, you need the Key Vault URIs you obtained earlier. See [Obtain the URI for each Azure Key Vault key](#obtain-the-uri-for-each-azure-key-vault-key) for instructions.
  
Remember! When you create a DEP, you specify two keys that reside in two different Azure Key Vaults. Ensure that these keys are located in two separate Azure regions to ensure geo-redundancy.
  
To create the DEP, follow these steps:
  
1. On your local computer, using a work or school account that has global administrator permissions in your organization, [connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps) by opening Windows PowerShell and running the following command.

   ```powershell
   $UserCredential = Get-Credential
   ```

2. In the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box, enter your work or school account information, click **OK**, and then enter the following command.

   ```powershell
   $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
   ```

3. Run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Import-PSSession $Session
   ```

4. To create a DEP, use the New-DataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet by typing the following command.

   ```powershell
   New-DataEncryptionPolicy -Name <PolicyName> -Description "Policy Description" -AzureKeyIDs <KeyVaultURI1>, <KeyVaultURI2>
   ```

   Where:

   - *PolicyName* is the name you want to use for the policy. Names cannot contain spaces. For example, USA_mailboxes.

   - *Policy Description* is a user friendly description of the policy that will help you remember what the policy is for. You can include spaces in the description. For example, "Root key for mailboxes in USA and its territories".

   - *KeyVaultURI1* is the URI for the first key in the policy. For example, https://contoso_EastUSvault01.vault.azure.net/keys/USA_key_01.

   - *KeyVaultURI2* is the URI for the second key in the policy. For example, https://contoso_EastUS2vault01.vault.azure.net/keys/USA_Key_02. Separate the two URIs by a comma and a space.

   Example:
  
   ```powershell
   New-DataEncryptionPolicy -Name USA_mailboxes -Description "Root key for mailboxes in USA and its territories" -AzureKeyIDs https://contoso_EastUSvault01.vault.azure.net/keys/USA_key_01, https://contoso_EastUS2vault01.vault.azure.net/keys/USA_Key_02
   ```

### Assign a DEP to a mailbox

Assign the DEP to a mailbox by using the Set-Mailbox cmdlet. Once you assign the policy, Microsoft 365 can encrypt the mailbox with the key designated in the DEP.
  
```powershell
Set-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdParameter> -DataEncryptionPolicy <PolicyName>
```

Where *MailboxIdParameter* specifies a mailbox. For more information about the Set-Mailbox cmdlet, see [Set-Mailbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailbox).

For [on-premises mailboxes using Outlook for iOS and Android with hybrid Modern Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients/outlook-for-ios-and-android/use-hybrid-modern-auth), the on-premises mailbox data that is synchronized into your Exchange Online tenant can have DEP assigned using the Set-MailUser cmdlet. 

```powershell
Set-MailUser -Identity <MailUserIdParameter> -DataEncryptionPolicy <PolicyName>
```

Where *MailUserIdParameter* specifies a mail user (also known as a mail-enabled user). For more information about the Set-MailUser cmdlet, see [Set-MailUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailuser).
  
### Validate mailbox encryption

Encrypting a mailbox can take some time. For first time policy assignment, the mailbox must also completely move from one database to another before the service can encrypt the mailbox. We recommend that you wait 72 hours before you attempt to validate encryption after you change a DEP or the first time you assign a DEP to a mailbox.
  
Use the Get-MailboxStatistics cmdlet to determine if a mailbox is encrypted.
  
```powershell
Get-MailboxStatistics -Identity <GeneralMailboxOrMailUserIdParameter> | fl IsEncrypted
```

The IsEncrypted property returns a value of **true** if the mailbox is encrypted and a value of **false** if the mailbox is not encrypted.

The time to complete mailbox moves depends on the number of mailboxes to which you assign a DEP for the first time, as well as the size of the mailboxes. If the mailboxes have not been encrypted after a week from the time you assigned the DEP, contact Microsoft.

## Office 365: Setting up Customer Key for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the tasks required to set up Azure Key Vault. See [Complete tasks in Azure Key Vault and Microsoft FastTrack for Customer Key](#complete-tasks-in-azure-key-vault-and-microsoft-fasttrack-for-customer-key) for information.
  
To set up Customer Key for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files you will need to perform these steps by remotely connecting to SharePoint Online with Windows PowerShell.
  
### Create a data encryption policy (DEP) for each SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business geo

You associate a DEP with a set of keys stored in Azure Key Vault. You apply a DEP to all of your data in one geographic location, also called a geo. If you use the multi-geo feature of Office 365, you can create one DEP per geo with the capability to use different keys per geo. If you are not using multi-geo, you can create one DEP in your organization for use with SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files. Microsoft 365 uses the keys identified in the DEP to encrypt your data in that geo. To create the DEP, you need the Key Vault URIs you obtained earlier. See [Obtain the URI for each Azure Key Vault key](#obtain-the-uri-for-each-azure-key-vault-key) for instructions.
  
Remember! When you create a DEP, you specify two keys that reside in two different Azure Key Vaults. Ensure that these keys are located in two separate Azure regions to ensure geo-redundancy.
  
To create a DEP, you need to remotely connect to SharePoint Online by using Windows PowerShell.
  
1. On your local computer, using a work or school account that has global administrator permissions in your organization, [Connect to SharePoint Online Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online?view=sharepoint-ps).

2. In the Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell, run the Register-SPODataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet as follows:

   ```powershell
   Register-SPODataEncryptionPolicy -Identity <SPOAdminSiteUrl> -PrimaryKeyVaultName <PrimaryKeyVaultName> -PrimaryKeyName <PrimaryKeyName> -PrimaryKeyVersion <PrimaryKeyVersion> -SecondaryKeyVaultName <SecondaryKeyVaultName> -SecondaryKeyName <SecondaryKeyName> -SecondaryKeyVersion <SecondaryKeyVersion>
   ```

   When you register the DEP, encryption begins on the data in the geo. This can take some time.

### Validate file encryption

 To validate encryption of SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams files, [connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps), and then use the Get-SPODataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet to check the status of your tenant. The _State_ property returns a value of **registered** if Customer Key encryption is enabled and all files in all sites have been encrypted. If encryption is still in progress, this cmdlet provides information on what percentage of sites is complete.
