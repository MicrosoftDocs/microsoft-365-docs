# Azure Function Master / API key  

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

This SIT is also included in the [All credentials](sit-defn-all-creds.md) bundled SIT.

 ## Format

A combination of 56 characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

or

A combination of up to 90 characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

## Pattern

Any combination of 54 characters consisting of:

- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- forward slashes (/)
- or plus signs (+)
- ends with two equal signs (=)

for example:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP==`

or

A combination of 54 to 84 characters consisting of:

- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- or percent signs (%)
- ends with a suffix '%3d%3d' (not case-sensitive)

for example:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789%2F%2BABCDEF0123456789%3D%3D


## Credential example 

`https://account.azurewebsites.net/api/function?code=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789%2F%2BABCDEF0123456789%3D%3D`

## Checksum

No

SITs that have checksums use a unique calculation to check if the information is valid. This means when the **Checksum** value is **Yes**, the service can make a positive detection based on the sensitive data alone. When the **Checksum** value is **No** additional (secondary) elements must also be detected  for the service to make a positive detection.

## Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used to request [Azure Function API](/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal) when its authorization level is set a value other than anonymous. 

It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of Base64 encoded 320-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of URL Encoded 320-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
- A dictionary of vocabulary.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
