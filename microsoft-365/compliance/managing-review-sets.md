# Manage review sets in eDiscovery (Premium)

Review sets are a static set of documents where you can analyze, query, view, tag, and export data in a case. For more information about performing these tasks, see:

- [Analyze data in a review set](analyzing-data-in-review-set.md)

- [Query the data in a review set](review-set-search.md)

- [View documents in a review set](view-documents-in-review-set.md)

- [Tag documents in a review set](tagging-documents.md)

- [Export case data](exporting-data-ediscover20.md)

## Create a review set

Review sets can be created on the **Review sets** tab by clicking **+ Add review set**.

On the **Add review set** flyout page, type a name for the review set and then click **Save**. The new review set is displayed in the list on the **Review sets** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete items from a review set and you can't delete review sets from a case. To delete a review set (and delete the data in it), you have to delete the eDiscovery (Premium) case the review set is located in. For more information, see [Close or delete an eDiscovery (Premium) case](close-or-delete-case.md).
