# Data Protection Impact Assessments

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are required to prepare a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.” There is nothing inherent in Microsoft Azure or Dynamics 365 that would necessarily require the creation of a DPIA by a Data Controller using it. Rather, whether a DPIA is required will be dependent on the details and context of *how* the data controller deploys, configures each product.

The purpose of this document is to provide data controllers with information that will help them to determine whether a DPIA is needed and, if so, what details to include.
