# Use file plan to create and manage retention labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

Although you can create and manage retention labels from **Information governance** in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, file plan from **Records management** has additional management capabilities:

- You can bulk-create retention labels by importing the relevant information from a spreadsheet.

- You can export the information from existing retention labels for analysis and offline collaboration.

- More information about the retention labels is displayed to make it easier to see into and across the settings of all your retention labels from one view.

- File plan descriptors support additional and optional information for each label.

File plan can be used for all retention labels, even if they don't mark content as a record.

For information about what retention labels are and how to use them, see [Learn about retention policies and retention labels](retention.md).

## Accessing file plan

To access file plan, you must have one of the following admin roles:
    
- Retention Manager

- View-only Retention Manager

In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, go to **Solutions** > **Records management** > **File plan**:

![File plan page](../media/compliance-file-plan.png). 

If **Records management** doesn't display in the navigation pane, first scroll down, and select **Show all**.

## Navigating your file plan

If you've already created retention labels from **Information governance** in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, these labels automatically display in your file plan. 

Similarly, if you now create retention labels in file plan, they are also available from **Information governance** if the labels aren't configured to mark content as a record.

On the **File plan** page, you see all your labels with their status and settings, optional file plan descriptors, an export option to analyze or enable offline reviews of your labels, and an import option to create retention labels. 

### Label settings columns

All columns except the label **Name** can be displayed or hidden by selecting the **Customize columns** option. But by default, the first few columns display information about the label status and its settings: 

- **Status** identifies whether the label is included in a label policy or auto-apply policy (**Active**) or not (**Inactive**).

- **Based on** identifies how or when the retention period begins. Valid values:
    - Event
    - When created
    - Last modified
    - When labeled

- **Is record** identifies if the item is marked as a record when the label is applied. Valid values:
    - No
    - Yes
    - Yes(Regulatory)

- **Retention duration** identifies the retention period. Valid values:
    - Days
    - Months
    - Years
    - Forever
    - None

- **Disposition type** identifies what happens to the content at the end of the retention period. Valid values:
    - No action
    - Auto-delete
    - Review required

### File plan descriptors columns

File plan lets you include more information as part of your retention labels. These file plan descriptors provide more options to improve the manageability and organization of the content you need to label.

By default, starting with **Reference ID**, the next few columns display these optional file plan descriptors that you can specify when you create a retention label, or edit an existing label. 

To get you started, there are some out-of-box values for the following file plan descriptors: 
- Business function/department
- Category
- Authority type
- Provision/citation 

Example of file plan descriptors when you create or edit a retention label:

![File plan descriptors when you create or edit a retention label.](../media/file-plan-descriptors.png)

When you select **Choose** for each of these optional descriptors, you can select one of the out-of-box values, or create your own and then select it. For example: 

![Create new file plan descriptor for provision/citation.](../media/file-plan-descriptors-create.png)

## Create retention labels

1. From the **File plan** page, select **+ Create a label** > **Retention label**

2. Follow the prompts for the configuration process.
    
    
    
    To use the retention label to declare records, select **Mark items as records**, or **Mark items as regulatory records**. For more information, see [Configuring retention labels to declare records](declare-records.md#configuring-retention-labels-to-declare-records).

3. After you have created the label and you see the options to publish the label, auto-apply the label, or just save the label: Select **Just save the label for now**, and then select **Done**.

4. Repeat these steps to create more labels.

## Edit retention labels

To edit an existing retention label, select it from the **File Plan** page, and then select the **Edit label** option to start the Edit retention process that lets you change the label description and any eligible settings.

Some settings can't be changed after the label is created and saved, which include:
- The retention label name and the retention settings except the retention period. However, you can't change the retention period when the retention period is based on when items were labeled.
- The option to mark items as a record.

## Delete retention labels

You can delete retention labels that aren't currently included in any [published](create-apply-retention-labels.md) or [auto-apply](apply-retention-labels-automatically.md) retention label policies, that aren't configured for event-based retention, or mark items as regulatory records.

For retention labels that you can delete, if they have been applied to items, the deletion fails and you see a link to content explorer to identify the labeled items.

However, it can take up to two days for content explorer to show the items that are labeled. In this scenario, the retention label might be deleted without showing you the link to content explorer.

## Export all retention labels to analyze or enable offline reviews

From your file plan, you can export the details of all retention labels into a .csv file to help you facilitate periodic compliance reviews with data governance stakeholders in your organization.

To export all retention labels: On the **File plan** page, click **Export**:

![Option to export file plan.](../media/compliance-file-plan-export-labels.png)

A *.csv file that contains all existing retention labels opens. For example:

![CSV file showing all retention labels.](../media/file-plan-csv-file.png)

## Import retention labels into your file plan

In file plan, you can bulk-import new retention labels by using a .csv file with a specific format: 

1. On the **File plan** page, click **Import**:
   ![Option to import file plan](../media/compliance-file-plan-import-labels.png)

2. On the **Fill out and import your file plan** pane, select **Download a blank template**:

   ![Option to download a blank file plan template](../media/file-plan-blank-template-option.png)

3. After the template downloads, add one row for each label, and save the file. See the [next section](#information-about-the-label-properties-for-import) for information that describes the properties and valid values for each property.
    
    Example of a filled in template:
    
    ![File plan template with information filled in.](../media/file-plan-filled-out-template.png)

4. Select **Upload a file** to upload the filled-out template.
    
   File plan uploads the file and validates the entries.

5. Depending on the validation results:
    
    - If validation fails: Note the row number and column name to correct in the import file. Correct the errors in the file and save it, and then repeat step 4.
    
    - If validation passes: You see **You successfully imported a file plan** and the entries are successfully converted into retention labels. Select **Done** to close the pane and automatically refresh the **File plan** page to display your new labels.

You can now publish your new retention labels, or auto-apply them. You can do both from the **Label policies** tab by selecting **Publish labels**, or **Auto-apply a label**.

### Information about the label properties for import

Use the following information to help you fill out the downloaded template to import new retention labels. Some values have a maximum length for import:

- **LabelName**: Maximum length of 64 characters
- **Comment** and **Notes**: Maximum length of 1024 characters

## Next steps

Now you've created retention labels, they are ready to be added to items by publishing the labels, or automatically applying them:
- [Publish retention labels and apply them in apps](create-apply-retention-labels.md)
- [Apply a retention label to content automatically](apply-retention-labels-automatically.md)
