# Use file plan to manage retention labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

Although you can create and manage retention labels from **Information governance** in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, file plan from **Records management** has additional management capabilities:

- You can bulk-create retention labels by importing the relevant information from a spreadsheet.

- You can export the information from existing retention labels for analysis and offline collaboration.

- More information about the retention labels is displayed to make it easier to see into and across the settings of all your retention labels from one view.

- File plan descriptors support additional and optional information for each label.

File plan can be used for all retention labels, even if they don't mark content as a record.

For information about what retention labels are and how to use them, see [Learn about retention policies and retention labels](retention.md).

## Accessing file plan

To access file plan, you must have one of the following admin roles:
    
- Retention Manager

- View-only Retention Manager

In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, go to **Solutions** > **Records management** > **File plan**. 

If **Records management** doesn't display in the navigation pane, first scroll down, and select **Show all**.

![File plan page.](../media/compliance-file-plan.png)

## Navigating your file plan

If you've already created retention labels from **Information governance** in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, these labels automatically display in your file plan. 

Similarly, if you now create retention labels in file plan, they are also available from **Information governance** if the labels aren't configured to mark content as a record.

On the **File plan** page, you see all your labels with their status and settings, optional file plan descriptors, an export option to analyze or enable offline reviews of your labels, and an import option to create retention labels. 

### Label settings columns

All columns except the label **Name** can be displayed or hidden by selecting the **Customize columns** option. But by default, the first few columns display information about the label status and its settings: 

- **Status** identifies whether the label is included in a label policy or auto-apply policy (**Active**) or not (**Inactive**).

- **Based on** identifies how or when the retention period begins. Valid values:
    - Event
    - When created
    - Last modified
    - When labeled

- **Is record** identifies if the item is marked as a record when the label is applied. Valid values:
    - No
    - Yes
    - Yes(Regulatory)

- **Retention duration** identifies the retention period. Valid values:
    - Days
    - Months
    - Years
    - Forever
    - None

- **Disposition type** identifies what happens to the content at the end of the retention period. Valid values:
    - No action
    - Auto-delete
    - Review required

### File plan descriptors columns

File plan lets you include more information as part of your retention labels. These file plan descriptors provide more options to improve the manageability and organization of the content you need to label.

By default, starting with **Reference ID**, the next few columns display these optional file plan descriptors that you can specify when you create a retention label, or edit an existing label. 

To get you started, there are some out-of-box values for the following file plan descriptors: 
- Business function/department
- Category
- Authority type
- Provision/citation 

Example of file plan descriptors when you create or edit a retention label:

![File plan descriptors when you create or edit a retention label.](../media/file-plan-descriptors.png)

When you select **Choose** for each of these optional descriptors, you can select one of the out-of-box values, or create your own and then select it. For example: 

![Create new file plan descriptor for provision/citation.](../media/file-plan-descriptors-create.png)

## Export all retention labels to analyze or enable offline reviews

From your file plan, you can export the details of all retention labels into a .csv file to help you facilitate periodic compliance reviews with data governance stakeholders in your organization.

To export all retention labels: On the **File plan** page, click **Export**:

![Option to export file plan.](../media/compliance-file-plan-export-labels.png)

A *.csv file that contains all existing retention labels opens. For example:

![CSV file showing all retention labels.](../media/file-plan-csv-file.png)

## Import retention labels into your file plan

In file plan, you can bulk-import new retention labels by using a .csv file with a specific format: 

1. On the **File plan** page, click **Import** to use the **Fill out and import your file plan** page:

   ![Option to import file plan.](../media/compliance-file-plan-import-labels.png)

   ![Option to download a blank file plan template.](../media/file-plan-blank-template-option.png)

2. Download a blank template as instructed:

   ![Blank file plan template opens in Excel.](../media/file-plan-blank-template.png)

3. Fill out the template, using the following information that describes the properties and valid values for each property. For import, some values have a maximum length:
    
    - **LabelName**: Maximum length of 64 characters

Although there are some built-in event types, such as **Employee activity** and **Product lifetime**, you can also create your own event types. </br> </br> If you specify your own event type, it must exist before the import because the name is validated as part of the import process.|

   Here's an example of the template containing the information about retention labels.

   ![File plan template with information filled in.](../media/file-plan-filled-out-template.png)

4. Under step 3 on the **Fill out and import your file plan** page, click **Browse for files** to upload the filled-out template, and then select **Next**.

   File plan uploads the file and validates the entries, displaying the import statistics.

   ![File plan import statistics.](../media/file-plan-import-statistics.png)

5. Depending on the validation results:
    
    - If validation fails: Note the row number and column name to correct in the import file. Select **Close**, and then **Yes** to confirm. Correct the errors in the file and save it, select the **Import** option again, and return to step 4.
    
    - If validation passes: You can select **Go Live** to make the retention labels available in your tenant. Or, select the Close icon for the page, and **Yes** to confirm you want to close the wizard without making the retention labels available in your tenant at this time.

When the imported labels are added to your tenant, you can now make them available to users by publishing them, or auto-apply them. You can do both from the **Label policies** tab, and then select **Publish labels**, or **Auto-apply a label**.
