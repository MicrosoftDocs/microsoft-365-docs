## Description

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used as a token in URL to do client validation or identification [user login process](/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal). It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of User Login Credentials in URL.
- Patterns of Password context in script.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
