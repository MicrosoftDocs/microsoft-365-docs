## Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used to access [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication) services as an admin account. 

It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of Base64 encoded 192 bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
- A dictionary of vocabulary.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns do not match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present will not be matched.
