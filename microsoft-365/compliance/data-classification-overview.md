# Know your data - data classification overview (preview)

As a Microsoft 365 administrator or compliance administrator, you can evaluate and then tag content in your organization in order to control where it goes, protect it no matter where it is and to ensure that it is preserved and deleted according your your organizations needs. You do this through the application of [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md), [retention labels](labels.md), and sensitive information type classification. There are various ways to do the discovery, evaluation and tagging, but the end result is that you may have very large numbers of documents and emails that are tagged and classified with one or both of these labels. After you apply  your retention labels and sensitivity labels, youâ€™ll want to see how the labels are being used across your tenant and what is being done with those items. The data classification page provides visibility into that body of content, specifically:

- the number items that have been classified as a sensitive information type and what those classifications are
- the top applied sensitivity labels in both Microsoft 365 and Azure Information Protection
- the top applied retention labels
- a summary of activities that users are taking on your sensitive content
- the locations of your sensitive and retained data

You can find data classification in the **Microsoft 365 compliance center** or **Microsoft 365 security center** > **Classification** > **Data Classification**.


## Prerequisites

Every account that accesses and uses activity explorer must have a license assigned to it from one of these subscriptions:

- Microsoft 365 (E5)
- Office 365 (E5)
- Advanced Compliance (E5) add-on
- Advanced Threat Intelligence (E5) add-on

## Sensitive information types used most in your content

Microsoft 365 comes with many definitions of sensitive information types, such as an item containing a social security number or a credit card number. For more information on sensitive information types, see [What the sensitive information types look for](what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for.md).

The sensitive information type card shows the top sensitive information types that have been found and labeled across your organization.

To find out how many items are in any given classification category, hover over the bar for the category.

![top sensitive information types hover detail](../media/data-classification-sens-info-types-hover.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If the card displays the message "No data found with sensitive information". It means that there are no items in your organization that have been classified as being a sensitive information type or no items that have been crawled. To get started with labels, see:
>- [Sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md)
>- [Retention labels](labels.md)
>- [What the sensitive information types look for](what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for.md)

## Top sensitivity labels applied to content

When you apply a sensitivity label to an item either through Microsoft 365 or Azure Information Protection (AIP), two things happen:

- a tag that indicates the value of the item to your org is embedded in the document and will follow it everywhere it goes
- the presence of the tag enables various protective behaviors, such as mandatory watermarking or encryption. With end point protection enabled you can even prevent an item from leaving your organizational control.

For more information on sensitivity labels, see: [Learn about sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md)

Sensitivity labels must be enabled for files that are in SharePoint and OneDrive in order for the corresponding data to surface in the data classification page. For more information, see [Enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive (public preview)](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.md).

The sensitivity label card shows the number of items (email or document) by sensitivity level.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't created or published any sensitivity labels or no content has had a sensitivity label applied, this card will display the message "No sensitivity labels detected". To get started with labels, see:
>- [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) or for AIP [Configure the Azure information protection policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy)

## Top retention labels applied to content

Retention labels are used to manage the disposition of content in your organization. When applied, they can be used to control how long a document will be kept before deletion, whether it should be reviewed prior to deletion, when it's retention period expires, or whether it should be marked as a record which can never be deleted. For more information see, [Overview of retention labels](labels.md).

The top applied retention labels card shows you how many items have a given retention label.

![top applied retention labels placeholder screenshot](../media/data-classification-top-retention-labels-applied.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If this card displays the message, "No retention labels detected, it means you haven't created or published any retention  labels or no content has had a retention label applied. To get started with retention labels, see:
>- [Overview of retention labels](labels.md)

## Top activities detected

This card provides a quick summary of the most common actions that users are taking on the sensitivity labeled items. You can use the [Activity explorer](data-classification-activity-explorer.md) to drill deep down on eight different activities that Microsoft 365 tracks on labeled content and content that is located on Windows 10 endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> If this card displays the message, "No activity detected" it means that there's been no activity on the files or that user and admin auditing isn't turned on. To turn the audit logs on , see:
>- [Search the audit log in security & compliance center](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md)

## Sensitivity and retention labeled data by location

The point of the data classification reporting is to provide visibility into the number of items that have which label as well as their location. These cards let you know how many labeled items the are in Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive etc.

> [!NOTE]
> If this card displays the message, "No locations detected, it means you haven't created or published any sensitivity labels or no content has had a retention label applied. To get started with sensitivity labels, see:
>- [Sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md)
