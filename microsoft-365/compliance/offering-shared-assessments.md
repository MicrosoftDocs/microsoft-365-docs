# Shared Assessments Program

## About Shared Assessments

[Shared Assessments](https://sharedassessments.org/), managed by [The Santa Fe Group](https://www.santa-fe-group.com/), is a program used by many commercial, retail, and investment banks around the world as a proxy for managing their third-party vendor risk assessment process. It publishes (and updates) instruments and a process that standardize the approach for member organizations to assess a CSP’s controls for people, processes, and procedures and offers a process to validate the accuracy of the information in the CSP’s report. Two tools are central to the program:

- The Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire is used to perform an initial assessment of vendors, gathering information to determine how security risks are managed across 18 domains within a CSP’s environment. With a single standard set of questions for every vendor, it streamlines the assessment of CSPs thus making comparisons more straightforward and efficient.
- The Standardized Control Assessment uses a set of objective procedures to help organizations validate a CSP’s answers to the SIG through onsite testing and other verification assessments.

## Microsoft and Shared Assessments

The Shared Assessments Program is based on a wide body of US and global industry-accepted security standards, regulations, and control frameworks, including the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v3.0.1. The CCM is a controls framework covering fundamental security principles across 16 domains to help cloud customers assess the overall security risk of a cloud service provider (CSP). These map to the 18 risk control areas (domains) that the Shared Assessments Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire uses.

For the CSA STAR self-assessment, Microsoft submitted a report documenting Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure Government compliance with the CCM. (Microsoft also publishes a completed Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) for Azure.) Based on that self-assessment, Azure and Azure Government align with the SIG questionnaire and the Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP) v5.0.

Azure compliance is listed on the CSA STAR Registry, a free publicly accessible registry where CSPs publish their CSA-related assessments. There, Azure also maintains formal CSA STAR Certification and CSA STAR Attestation.

Because these self-assessment reports are publicly available, Azure customers gain visibility into Microsoft security practices and can compare various CSPs using the same baseline.
