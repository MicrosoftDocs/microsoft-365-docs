# Accountability Readiness Checklist for Microsoft 365

## 1. Introduction

This accountability readiness checklist provides a convenient way to access information you may need to support the GDPR when using Microsoft Office 365.

You can manage the items in this checklist with [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md) by referencing the Control ID and Control Title under *Customer Managed Controls* in the GDPR tile.

In addition, items in this checklist under *5.* *Data Protection & Security* provide references to controls listed under Microsoft Managed Controls in the GDPR tile in [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md). Reviewing the Microsoft Implementation Details for these controls provide additional explanation of Microsoft's approach to fulfilling the customer considerations in the checklist item.

The checklist and Compliance Manager are organized using the titles and reference number (in parentheses for each checklist topic) of a set of privacy and security controls for personal data processors drawn from:

- [ISO/IEC 27701](https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030351736) for security techniques requirements.
- [ISO/IEC 27001](https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030347472) for privacy management requirements.

This control structure is also used to organize the presentation of the internal controls that Microsoft Office 365 implements to support GDPR, which you can download from the [Service Trust Center](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/TrustDocuments).
