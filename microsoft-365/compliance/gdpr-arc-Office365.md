# Accountability Readiness Checklist for Microsoft Office 365

## 1. Introduction
This accountability readiness checklist provides a convenient way to access information you may need to support the GDPR when using Microsoft Office 365.

You can manage the items in this checklist with [Compliance Manager](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager) by referencing the Control ID and Control Title under *Customer Managed Controls* in the GDPR tile.

In addition, items in this checklist under *5.* *Data Protection & Security* provide references to controls listed under Microsoft Managed Controls in the GDPR tile in [Compliance Manager](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager). Reviewing the Microsoft Implementation Details for these controls provide additional explanation of Microsoft’s approach to fulfilling the customer considerations in the checklist item.

The checklist and Compliance Manager are organized using the titles and reference number (in parenthesis for each checklist topic) of a set of privacy and security controls for personal data processors drawn from *ISO/IEC CD 27552 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Enhancement to ISO/IEC 27001 for privacy management – Requirements. *

This control structure is also used to organize the presentation of the internal controls that Microsoft Office 365 implements to support GDPR, which you can [download](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/TrustDocuments).

*ISO/IEC CD 27552*, a standard under current development, will enhance *ISO/IEC 27001* requirements. It covers process for protecting the capture, accountability, availability, integrity and confidentiality of data. To purchase a copy of the complete draft ISO standard, please visit *https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030372571*.
