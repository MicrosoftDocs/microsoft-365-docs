# Detailed properties in the audit log

When you export the results of an audit log search from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you have the option to download all the results that meet your search criteria. You do this by selecting **Export results** \> **Download all results** on the **Audit log search** page. For more information, see [Search the audit log](audit-log-search.md).
  
 When your export all results for an audit log search, the raw data from the unified audit log is copied to a comma-separated value (CSV) file that is downloaded to your local computer. This file contains additional information from each audit record in a column named **AuditData**. This column contains a multi-value property for multiple properties from the audit log record. Each of the **property: value** pairs in this multi-value property are separated by a comma. 
  
The following table describes the properties that are included (depending on the service in which an event occurs) in the multi-property **AuditData** column. The **Office 365 service that has this property** column indicates the service and type of activity (user or admin) that includes the property. For more detailed information about these properties or about properties that may not be listed in this topic, see [Management Activity API Schema](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema).
  
> [!TIP]
> You can use the JSON transform feature in Power Query in Excel to split the **AuditData** column into multiple columns so that each property has its own column. This lets you sort and filter on one or more of these properties. To learn how to do this, see [Export, configure, and view audit log records](audit-log-export-records.md).
