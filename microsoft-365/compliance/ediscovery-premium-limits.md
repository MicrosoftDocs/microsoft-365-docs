|The maximum size of an item that can be viewed on the sample page of a collection estimate.|10,000,000 bytes (approximately 9.5 MB)|

## Search times

Microsoft collects performance information for searches run by all organizations. While the complexity of the search query can impact search times, the biggest factor that affects how long searches take is the number of mailboxes searched. Although Microsoft doesn't provide a Service Level Agreement for search times, the following table lists average search times for collection searches based on the number of mailboxes included in the search.
  
|Number of mailboxes|Average search time|
|:---|:---|
|100|30 seconds|
|1,000|45 seconds|
|10,000|4 minutes|
|25,000|10 minutes|
|50,000|20 minutes|
|100,000|25 minutes|

## Viewer limits

|Description of limit|Limit|
|:---|:---|
|Maximum size of Excel file that can be viewed in the native viewer.|4 MB|

## Export limits - Final export out of Review Set

The limits described in this section are related to exporting documents out of a review set.

|Description of limit|Limit|
|:---|:---|
|Maximum size of a single export.|5 million documents or 500 GB, whichever is smaller|

## Review set download limits

|Description of limit|Limit|

## Need help with eDiscovery issues?

Check out the [Resolve common eDiscovery issues](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/ediscovery/resolve-ediscovery-issues) article for basic troubleshooting steps that you can take to identify and resolve issues that you might encounter during an eDiscovery search or elsewhere in the eDiscovery process.

## Reference notes

<sup>1</sup> This is the maximum number of tags that you can create in a case. This limit isn't related to the number of documents that can be tagged.

<sup>2</sup> When you put more than 1,000 mailboxes or 100 sites on hold in a single hold policy, the system will automatically scale the hold as needed. This means the system will automatically add data locations to multiple hold policies, instead of adding them to a single hold policy. However, the limit of 10,000 case hold policies per organization still applies.

<sup>3</sup> Any item that exceeds a single file limit will show up as a processing error.

<sup>4</sup> When searching SharePoint and OneDrive for Business locations, the characters in the URLs of the sites being searched count against this limit. The total number of characters consists of:

  - All characters in both the Users and Filters fields.
  - All search permissions filters that apply to the user.
  - The characters from any location properties in the search, including ExchangeLocation, PublicFolderLocation, SharPointLocation, ExchangeLocationExclusion, PublicFolderLocationExclusion, SharePointLocationExclusion, and OneDriveLocationExclusion. For example, including all SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts in the search will count as six characters, as the word "ALL" will appear for both the SharePointLocation and OneDriveLocation field.

<sup>5</sup> For non-phrase queries (a keyword value that doesn't use double quotation marks) we use a special prefix index. This tells us that a word occurs in a document, but not where it occurs in the document. To do a phrase query (a keyword value with double quotation marks), we need to compare the position within the document for the words in the phrase. This means that we can't use the prefix index for phrase queries. In this case, we internally expand the query with all possible words that the prefix expands to; for example,  **time\*** can expand to  **"time OR timer OR times OR timex OR time boxed OR ..."**. The limit of 10,000 is the maximum number of variants the word can expand to, not the number of documents matching the query. There's no upper limit for non-phrase terms.

<sup>6</sup> This limit applies to downloading selected documents from a review set. It doesn't apply to exporting documents from a review set. For more information about downloading and exporting documents, see [Export case data in eDiscovery (Premium)](ediscovery-exporting-data.md).
