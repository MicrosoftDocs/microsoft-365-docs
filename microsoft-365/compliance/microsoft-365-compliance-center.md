## Welcome to Microsoft 365 compliance

When you go to your Microsoft 365 compliance center for the first time, you'll be greeted with the following welcome message:

![Microsoft 365 compliance center intro](media/m365-compliancecenter-welcomesteps.png)

The welcome banner gives you some pointers on how to get started, with next steps and an invitation for you to give us feedback.

## The Assess section

The **Assess** section on the home page shows you at a glance how your organization is doing with respect to [data protection and compliance](protect-access-to-data-and-services.md).

![Assess section in Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-assess.png)

From here, you can go to the Microsoft Compliance Score card, which leads you to [Compliance Manager](meet-data-protection-and-regulatory-reqs-using-microsoft-cloud.md), where you can review or edit your configurations and potentially improve your overall compliance score.

You'll see additional cards, such as one showing your organization's cloud app compliance, and another showing data about users with shared files, with links to [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/) or other tools where you can explore data.

## The Protect section

The **Protect** section on the home page contains cards that provide you with high-level information about [labels](labels.md), [data loss prevention (DLP)](data-loss-prevention-policies.md), third-party apps in use, shared files, shadow IT apps, and so on. 

![Protect section in the Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-protect.png)

Each card has a link to a report or additional information where you can learn more.

## The Respond section

The **Respond** section on the home page surfaces [alerts](../security/office-365-security/alerts.md) and [pending dispositions](disposition-reviews.md) that you'll want to review and potentially act upon.

![Respond section in the Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-respond.png)

Cards, such as the [Active alerts](../security/office-365-security/alerts.md) card, include a link to a page where you can view more detailed information, such as Severity, Status, Category, and more.

## Easy navigation to more compliance features and capabilities

## Frequently asked questions

### Why am I taken to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to perform some tasks, such as defining certain policies?

We are still developing the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and we'll be adding more functionality and solutions over the coming months. In the meantime, there are some tasks that must be performed in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). In those cases, you'll be directed automatically to the location where you can perform the task at hand, such as creating or editing a supervision policy.

### Why don't I see the new Microsoft 365 compliance center yet?

First, make sure you have the appropriate [licenses and permissions](../security/office-365-security/microsoft-security-and-compliance.md#required-licenses-and-permissions). Then, sign in at [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com). If you don't see the new compliance center yet, you will have it soon.

### Some of my compliance features are not available in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. What do I do?

We are still adding functionality to the Microsoft 365 compliance center. If you can't find something, such as audit log search, use the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). Your configurations will be saved in both the existing Office 365 Security & Compliance Center and in the new Microsoft 365 compliance center automatically.

To go there, in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, in the navigation pane on the left side of the screen, choose **More resources**, and then, under **Office 365 security & compliance center**, choose **Open**.
