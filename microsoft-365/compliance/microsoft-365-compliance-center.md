The welcome banner gives you some pointers on how to get started, with next steps, and an invitation for you to give us feedback.

## Card section

When you first visit the Microsoft 365 compliance center, the card section on the home page shows you at a glance how your organization is doing with data compliance, what solutions are available for your organization, and a summary of any active alerts.

From here, you can:

- Review the **Microsoft Compliance Manager** card, which leads you to the [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md) solution. Compliance Manager helps simplify the way you manage compliance. It calculates a risk-based score measuring your progress toward completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It also provides workflow capabilities and built-in control mapping to help you efficiently carry out improvement actions.

- Review the new **Solution catalog** card, which links to collections of [integrated solutions](microsoft-365-solution-catalog.md) you can use to help you manage end-to-end compliance scenarios. A solution's capabilities and tools might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

We're still developing the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and we add more functionality and solutions over the coming months. In the meantime, there are a few tasks that must be completed in the Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). In those cases, you'll be directed automatically to the location where you can complete the task at hand, such as creating or editing a supervision policy.

**Why don't I see the new Microsoft 365 compliance center yet?**

First, make sure that you have the appropriate licenses and permissions. Then, sign in at [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com). If you don't see the new compliance center yet, you'll have it soon.
