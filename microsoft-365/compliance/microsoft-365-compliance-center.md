# Microsoft Purview compliance portal

If you're interested in your organization's compliance posture, you're going to love the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>. The Microsoft Purview compliance portal provides easy access to the data and tools you need to manage to your organization's compliance needs.

Read this article to get acquainted with the compliance portal, [how to access it](#how-do-i-access-the-compliance-portal), and your [next steps](#next-steps).

## Welcome to Microsoft Purview

When you go to the compliance portal for the first time, you're greeted with the following welcome message:

![Microsoft Purview compliance portal intro.](../media/m365-compliance-center-welcome-steps.png)

The welcome banner gives you some pointers on how to get started, with next steps, and an invitation for you to give us feedback.

## Card section

When you first visit the compliance portal, the card section on the home page shows you at a glance how your organization is doing with data compliance, what solutions are available for your organization, and a summary of any active alerts.

From here, you can:

- Review the **Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager** card, which leads you to the [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md) solution. Compliance Manager helps simplify the way you manage compliance. It calculates a risk-based score measuring your progress toward completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It also provides workflow capabilities and built-in control mapping to help you efficiently carry out improvement actions.

- Review the new **Solution catalog** card, which links to collections of [integrated solutions](microsoft-365-solution-catalog.md) you can use to help you manage end-to-end compliance scenarios. A solution's capabilities and tools might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

- Review the **Active alerts** card, which includes a summary of the most [active alerts](alert-policies.md) and includes a link where you can view more detailed information, such as Severity, Status, Category, and more.

    ![Active alerts card Microsoft Purview compliance portal.](../media/m365-compliance-center-active-alerts-card.png)

You can also use the **Add cards** feature to add additional cards, such as one showing your organization's cloud app compliance, and another showing data about users with shared files, with links to [Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/) or other tools where you can explore data.

## Easy navigation to more compliance features and capabilities

In addition to links in cards on the home page, you'll see a navigation pane on the left side of the screen that gives you easy access to your [alerts](../security/office-365-security/alerts.md), [reports](reports-in-security-and-compliance.md), [policies](alert-policies.md), compliance solutions, and more. To add or remove options for a customized navigation pane, use the **Customize navigation** control on the navigation pane. This opens the **Customize your navigation pane** settings so you can configure which items appear in the navigation pane.
