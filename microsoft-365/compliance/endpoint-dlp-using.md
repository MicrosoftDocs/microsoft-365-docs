# Using Endpoint data loss prevention

To help familiarize you with Endpoint DLP features and how they surface in DLP policies, we've put together some scenarios for you to follow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These Endpoint DLP scenarios are not the official procedures for creating and tuning DLP policies. Refer to the below topics when you need to work with DLP policies in general situations:
>
>- [Learn about Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md)
>- [Get started with the default DLP policy](get-started-with-the-default-dlp-policy.md)
>- [Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md)

## Before you begin

### SKU/subscriptions licensing

For full licensing details, see [Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for information protection](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection-data-loss-prevention-for-exchange-online-sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-for-business).

These scenarios require that you already have devices onboarded and reporting into Activity explorer. If you haven't onboarded devices yet, see [Get started with Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure you understand the difference between an unrestricted administrator and an administrative unit restricted administrator [Administrative units](microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions.md#administrative-units) before you start.

## Scenario 1: Create a policy from a template, audit only

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating and full directory policy.

1. Open the [Data loss prevention page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=policies).

1. Choose **Create policy**.

1. For this scenario, choose **Privacy**, then **U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data Enhanced**, and then choose **Next**.

1. Give your new policy a **Name** and **Description**.

1. Under **Admin units**, select **Full directory** and then **Next**.

1. Toggle the **Status** field off for all locations except **Devices**. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Define policy settings** page, accept the default **Review and customize settings from the template** selection and choose **Next**.

1. On the **Info to protect** page, accept the default values and choose **Next**.

1. Accept the default **Protection actions** and choose **Next**.
 
1. On the **Customize access and override settings** page, choose **Audit or restrict activities on Devices**. Accept the remaining default values and choose **Next**.

1. On the **Policy mode** page, accept the default **Test it out first** and select **Show policy tips while in test mode**. Choose **Next**.

1. Review your policy  and choose **Submit** to create it, then choose **Done**. The new policy appears in the DLP **Policies** list.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Data loss prevention** and then **Activity explorer**.

1. Try to share a test item containing content that will trigger the U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data condition. This should trigger the policy.

1. Check Activity explorer for the event.

## Scenario 2: Modify the existing policy, set an alert

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin modifying a full directory scoped policy.

1. Navigate to the data loss prevention [Policies page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=policies).

1. Choose the **U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data Enhanced** policy that you created in Scenario 1.

1. Choose **Edit policy**.

1. Go to the **Customize advanced DLP rules** page and edit the **Low volume of content detected U.S. Personally Identifiable Inf**.

1. Scroll down to the **Incident reports** section and toggle **Send an alert to admins when a rule match occurs** to **On**. Email alerts will be automatically sent to the administrator and anyone else you add to the list of recipients.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="This screenshot shows the option to turn on incident reports." source="../media/endpoint-dlp-2-using-dlp-incident-reports.png":::
   
1. For the purposes of this scenario, choose **Send alert every time an activity matches the rule**.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Retain all your previous settings by choosing **Next** throughout the rest of the wizard, then **Submit** the policy changes.

1. Try to share a test item containing content that will trigger the U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data condition. This should trigger the policy.

1. Check the activity explorer for the event.

## Scenario 3: Modify the existing policy, block the action with allow override

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin modifying a full directory policy.

1. Open the data loss prevention [Policies page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=policies).

1. Choose the **U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data** policy that you created in Scenario 1.

1. Choose **Edit policy**.

1. Go to the **Advanced DLP rules** page and edit the **Low volume of content detected U.S. Personally Identifiable Inf**.

1. Scroll down to the **Audit or restrict activities on Windows device** section and set both options under the **Service domain and browser activities** to **Block with override**.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="The screenshot shows the set block with override action options." source="../media/endpoint-dlp-6-using-dlp-set-blocked-with-override.png":::
   
1. Choose **Save**.

1. Repeat steps 4-6 for the **High volume of content detected U.S. Personally Identifiable Inf**.

1. Retain all your previous settings by choosing **Next** through the rest of the wizard,and then **Submit** the policy changes.

1. Attempt to share a test item that contains content that will trigger the U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data condition with someone outside your organization. This should trigger the policy.

   You'll see a popup like this on the client device:
   
   :::image type="content" alt-text=" This screenshot shows the endpoint dlp client blocked override notification." source="../media/endpoint-dlp-3-using-dlp-client-blocked-override-notification.png":::

1. Check the activity explorer for the event.

## Scenario 4: Avoid looping DLP notifications from cloud synchronization apps with auto-quarantine

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating a full directory policy.

## Before you begin Scenario 4

In this scenario, synchronizing files with the **Highly Confidential** sensitivity label to OneDrive is blocked. This is a complex scenario with multiple components and procedures. You'll need:

- A Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account to target and an onboarded Windows 10/11 computer that is already synchronizing a local OneDrive folder with OneDrive cloud storage.
- Sensitivity labels configured and publishedâ€”see [Get started with sensitivity labels](get-started-with-sensitivity-labels.md#get-started-with-sensitivity-labels) and [Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies](create-sensitivity-labels.md#create-and-configure-sensitivity-labels-and-their-policies).

There are three procedures.

1. Configure the Endpoint DLP Auto-quarantine settings.
1. Create a policy that blocks sensitive items that have the **Highly Confidential** sensitivity label.
1. Create a Word document on the Windows 10/11 device that the policy is targeted to, apply the label, and copy it to the user accounts local OneDrive folder that is being synchronized.  

### Configure Endpoint DLP unallowed app and Auto-quarantine settings

1. Open [Endpoint DLP settings](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=globalsettings)

1. Expand **Restricted apps and app groups**.

1. Under **Restricted app groups**, choose **Add restricted app group**. Enter *Cloud Sync apps* as the group name.
 
1. Select the **Auto-quarantine** box.
 
1. For the **App name**, enter *OneDrive*. For the **Executable name**, enter *onedrive.exe*, then choose the **+** button. This will disallow onedrive.exe from accessing items with the **Highly Confidential** label.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Under **Auto-quarantine settings** choose **Edit auto-quarantine settings**.

1. Enable **Auto-quarantine for unallowed apps**.

1. Enter the path to the folder on local machines where you want the original sensitive files to be moved to. For example:
   
  > **'%homedrive%%homepath%\Microsoft DLP\Quarantine'** for the username *Isaiah Langer* will place the moved items in a folder named:  

  > *C:\Users\IsaiahLanger\Microsoft DLP\Quarantine\OneDrive*

1. Append a date and time stamp to the original file name.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > DLP auto-quarantine will create sub-folders for the files for each unallowed app. So if you have both *Notepad* and *OneDrive* in your unallowed apps list, a sub-folder will be created for **\OneDrive** and another sub-folder for **\Notepad**.

1. Choose **Replace the files with a .txt file that contains the following text** and enter the text you want in the placeholder file. For example for a file named *auto quar 1.docx*, you could enter:
    
   > %%FileName%% contains sensitive info that your organization is protecting with the data loss prevention (DLP) policy %%PolicyName%%. It was moved to the quarantine folder: %%QuarantinePath%%
    
   will leave a text file that contains this message:
    
   > auto quar 1.docx contains sensitive info that your organization is protecting with the data loss prevention (DLP) policy. It was moved to the quarantine folder: C:\Users\IsaiahLanger\Microsoft DLP\Quarantine\OneDrive\auto quar 1.docx.

1. Choose **Save**.

### Configure a policy to block OneDrive synchronization of files with the sensitivity label "Highly Confidential"

1. Open the [Data loss prevention page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention?viewid=policies).

1. Navigate to **Data loss prevention"** **Policies** > **Create policy**.

1. For this scenario, choose **Custom**, then **Custom policy**. Choose **Next**.

1. Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields, choose **Next**.

1. Select **Full directory** under **Admin units**.

1. Toggle the **Status** field to off for all locations except **Devices**. If you have a specific end user account that you want to test this from, be sure to select it in the scope. Choose **Next**.

1. Accept the default **Create or customize advanced DLP rules** selection and choose **Next**.

1. Create a rule with these values:
 
   1. **Name** > *Scenario 4 Auto-quarantine*.
   1. Under **Conditions** choose **Add condition** and then **Content Contains**.
   1. Enter a group name, for example *Highly-Confidential Sensitivity Labels* and then choose **Add**.
   1. Select **Sensitivity labels** then **Highly Confidential** and choose **Add**.
   1. Under **Actions** choose **Add an action**. 
   1. Select **Audit or restrict activities on Windows devices** > **File activities for apps in restricted app groups**.
   1. Choose **Add restricted app group** then choose the *Cloud Sync Apps* group you created previously.
   1. Choose **Apply a restriction to all activity** > **Block**. For the purposes of this scenario, clear all the other activities.
   1. Under **User notifications**, toggle **User notifications** to **On** and under **Endpoint devices** choose **Show users a policy tip notification when an activity** if not already enabled.
  
1. Choose **Save** and **Next**.

1. Choose **Turn it on right away**. Choose **Next**.

1. Review your settings and choose **Submit**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Allow at least an hour for the new policy to be replicated and applied to the target Windows 10 computer.

1. The new DLP policy appears in the policy list.

### Test Auto-quarantine on the Windows 10/11 device

1. Sign in to the Windows 10/11 computer with the user account you specified in [Configure a policy to block OneDrive synchronization of files with the sensitivity label Highly Confidential](#configure-a-policy-to-block-onedrive-synchronization-of-files-with-the-sensitivity-label-highly-confidential, step 5.

1. Create a folder whose contents won't be synchronized to OneDrive. For example:

   > *C:\auto-quarantine source folder*

1. Open Microsoft Word and create a file in the auto-quarantine source folder. Apply the **Highly confidential** sensitivity label; see [Apply sensitivity labels to your files and email in Office](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9).

1. Copy the file you just created to your OneDrive synchronization folder. A user notification toast should appear telling you that the action is not allowed and that the file will be quarantined. For example, for user name *Isaiah Langer*, and a document titled *auto-quarantine doc 1.docx* you would see this message:

   :::image type="content" alt-text="This screenshot shows the Data loss prevention user notification message that the OneDrive synchronization action isn't allowed for the specified file and that the file will be quarantined." source="../media/auto-quarantine-user-notification-toast.png":::
    
   The message reads:

   > Opening auto-quarantine doc 1.docx with this app is not allowed. The file will be quarantined to 'C:\Users\IsaiahLanger\Microsoft DLP\OneDrive'

1. Choose **Dismiss**.

1. Open the place holder text file. It will be named **auto-quarantine doc 1.docx_*date_time*.txt**. 

1. Open the quarantine folder and confirm that the original file is there.
 
1. Check Activity explorer for data from the monitored endpoints. Set the location filter for devices and add the policy, then filter by policy name to see the effect of this policy. For information on using activity explorer, see [Get started with activity explorer](data-classification-activity-explorer.md).

1. Check Activity explorer for the event.

## Scenario 5: Restrict unintentional sharing to unallowed cloud apps and services

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating a full directory policy.

With Endpoint DLP and a supported web browser, you can restrict unintentional sharing of sensitive items to unallowed cloud apps and services. Microsoft Edge understands when an item is restricted by an Endpoint DLP policy and enforces access restrictions.

[!INCLUDE [supported-web-browsers](../includes/supported-web-browsers.md)]

When you select **Devices** as a location in a properly configured DLP policy and use a supported web browser, the unallowed browsers that you've defined in these settings will be prevented from accessing the sensitive items that match your DLP policy controls. Instead, users will be redirected to use Microsoft Edge, which, with its understanding of DLP imposed restrictions, can block or restrict activities when the conditions in the DLP policy are met.

To use this restriction, youâ€™ll need to configure three important pieces:

1. Specify the places â€“ services, domains, IP addresses â€“ that you want to prevent sensitive items from being shared to.

1. Add the browsers that arenâ€™t allowed to access certain sensitive items when a DLP policy match occurs.

1. Configure DLP policies to define the kinds of sensitive items for which upload should be restricted to these places by turning on **Upload to cloud services** and **Access from unallowed browser**.

You can continue to add new services, apps, and policies to extend and augment your restrictions to meet your business needs and protect sensitive data. 

This configuration will help ensure your data remains safe while also avoiding unnecessary restrictions that prevent or restrict users from accessing and sharing nonsensitive items.

You can also audit, block with override, or block these user-upload sensitive items to cloud apps and services through **Sensitive service domains**.

1. In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal navigate to **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings** > **Browser and domain restrictions to sensitive data** > **Sensitive service domain groups**.

1. Select **Create sensitive service domain group**.

1. Name the group.

1. Enter the **Sensitive service domain** for the group. You can add multiple websites to a group and use wildcards to cover subdomains.  For example, `www.contoso.com` for just the top level website, or: \*.contoso.com for corp.contoso.com, hr.contoso.com, fin.contoso.com.
 
1. Select the **Match type** you want. You can select from **URL**, **IP address**, **IP address range**.

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Data loss prevention** \> **Policies**.

1. Create and scope a policy that is applied only to the **Devices** location. For more information on how to create a policy, see [Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md). Be sure to scope the **Admin units** to **Full directory**.

1. Create a rule that uses the condition **The user accesses a sensitive site from Edge**.

1. Add the action **Audit or restrict activities on devices**.

1. Under **Service domain and browser activities**, choose **Upload to a restricted cloud service domain or access from an unallowed browser** and set the action to **Audit only**.

1. Select **Choose different restrictions for sensitive service domains** and then choose **Add group**.
 
1. On **the Choose sensitive service domain groups** flyout, select the sensitive service domain group(s) you want, choose **Add** and then choose **Save**.

1. On the confirmation page, choose **Done**.

1. Select the user activities you want to monitor or restrict and the actions for DLP to take in response to those activities.

1. On the **Policy mode** page, choose **Turn it on right away**. Choose **Next** and then **Submit**.

## Scenario 6: Monitor or restrict user activities on sensitive service domains

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating a full directory policy.

Use this scenario when you want to audit or block the following user activities on a website.

- print from a website
- copy data from a website
- save a website as local files

[!INCLUDE [supported-web-browsers](../includes/supported-web-browsers.md)]

### Configure Sensitive service domains

1. In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal open **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings** > **Browser and domain restrictions to sensitive data** > **Sensitive service domains**.

1. To control whether sensitive files can be uploaded to specific domains, select **Add cloud service domain**.

1.  Enter the domain that you want to want to audit or block and choose the **+** button. Repeat for any additional domains. Choose **Save**.
 
1. Under **Sensitive service domain groups**, choose **Create sensitive service domain group**.

1. Give the group a name, celect the **Match type** you want (you can select from **URL**, **IP address**, **IP address range**), and enter the URL, IP address, or IP address range to be audited or blocked. When matching a URL, you can add multiple websites to a group and use wildcards to cover subdomains.  For example, `www.contoso.com` for just the top level website or \*.contoso.com for corp.contoso.com, hr.contoso.com, fin.contoso.com.

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Data loss prevention** \> **Policies**.

1. Create and scope a policy that is applied only to the **Devices** location. See, [Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md) for more information on how to create a policy. Be sure to scope the **Admin units** to **Full directory**.

1. Create a rule that uses the condition **the user accessed a sensitive site from Edge**, and the action **Audit or restrict activities when users access sensitive sites in Microsoft Edge browser on Windows devices**.

1. In the action, under **Sensitive Site Restrictions**, select **Add or remove Sensitive site groups**.

1. Create and/or select the **Sensitive site groups** you want. Any website under the group(s) you select here will be redirected to Microsoft Edge when opened in Chrome or Firefox (so long as the Microsoft Purview extension is installed).

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select the user activities you want to monitor or restrict and the actions you want Microsoft Purview to take in response to those activities.

1. Finish configuring the rule and policy and choose **Submit** and then **Done**.

## Scenario 7: Restrict pasting sensitive content into a browser (preview)
This scenario is for restricting users from pasting sensitive content into a browser web form or field.

### Create your DLP policy
You can set up different levels of enforcement when it comes to blocking data from being pasted into a browser. To do this, create different URL groups. For instance, you can create a policy that warns users against posting U.S. Social Security Numbers (SSN) to any website, and that triggers an audit action for websites in Group A. You can create another policy that completely blocks the paste action--without giving a warning--for all of the websites in Group B.

**Create a URL group**

1. In Microsoft Purview, open the [compliance portal](https://sip.compliance.microsoft.com/homepage) and navigate to **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings**, and scroll down to **Browser and domain restrictions to sensitive data**. Expand the section.

1. Scroll down to **Sensitive service domain groups**.

1. Choose **Create sensitive service domain group**.

   1. Enter a **Group name**.
   1. In the **Sensitive service domain** field, enter the URL for the first website you want to monitor and then choose **Add site**.
   1. Continue adding URLs for the rest of the websites you want to monitor in this group.
   1. When you are finished adding all URLs to your group, choose **Save**.

1. Create as many separate groups of URLs as you need.

**Restrict pasting content into a browser**
1. Create a DLP policy scoped to **Devices**. For information on how to create a DLP policy, see [Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md#create-and-deploy-data-loss-prevention-policies).

1. On the [Define policy settings page](https://sip.compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention/policies) in the DLP policy creation flow, select **Create or customize advanced DLP rules** and then choose **Next**.

1. On the **Customize advanced DLP rules** page, choose **Create rule**.

1. Enter a name and description for the rule.

1. Expand **Conditions**, choose **Add condition**, and then select the **Sensitive info types**.

1. Under **Content Contains**, scroll down and select the new sensitive information type that you previously chose or created.

1. Scroll down to the **Actions** section, and choose **Add an action**.

1. Choose **Audit or restrict activities on devices**

1. In the **Actions** section, under **Service domain and browser activities**, select **Paste to supported browsers**.1. 

1. Set the restriction to **Audit**, **Block with override**, or **Block**, and then choose **Add**.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Choose **Next**

1. Choose whether you want to test your policy, turn it on right away, or keep it off, and then choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Submit**.

## Scenario 8: Authorization groups

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating a full directory policy.

These scenarios require that you already have devices onboarded and reporting into Activity explorer. If you haven't onboarded devices yet, see [Get started with Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md).

Authorization groups are mostly used as allowlists. You assigned policy actions to the group that are different than the global policy actions. In this scenario, we'll go through defining a printer group and then configuring a policy with block actions for all print activities except for the printers in the group. These procedures are essentially the same for **Removeable storage device groups**, and **Network share groups**.

In this scenario, we'll define a group of printers that the legal department uses for printing contracts. Printing contracts to any other printers is blocked.

### Create and use printer groups

1. In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal open **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings** > **Printer groups**.

1. Select **Create printer group** and enter a **Group a name**. In this scenario, we'll use `Legal printers`.

1. Select **Add printer** and provide a name. You can define printers by:

   1. Friendly printer name 
   1. USB product ID
   1. USB vendor ID
   1. IP range
   1. Print to file
   1. Universal print deployed on a printer
   1. Corporate printer
   1. Print to local

1. Select **Close**.

### Configure policy printing actions

1. Navigate to **Data loss prevention** > **Policies**.

1. Select **Create policy** and select the custom policy template.

1. Select **Full directory** under **Admin units**.

1. Scope the location to only the **Devices** location.

1. Create a rule with the following values:

   1. Add a **Condition**: **Content contains** = **Trainable classifiers**, **Legal Affairs**
   1. **Actions** = **Audit or restrict activities on devices**
   1. Then pick **File activities on all apps**
   1. The select **Apply restrictions to specific activity**
   1. Select **Print** = **Block**

1. Select **Choose different print restrictions**

1. Under **Printer group restrictions**, select **Add group** and select **Legal printers**.

1. Set **Action** = **Allow**.

   > [!TIP]
   > The **Allow** action wil record  and audit event to the audit log, but not generate an alert or notification. 

1. Select **Save** and then **Next**.

1. Accept the default **I'd like to test it out first** value and choose **Show policy tips while in test mode**. Choose **Next**.

1. Review your settings and choose **Submit**.

1. The new DLP policy will appear in the policy list.

## Scenario 9: Network exceptions

This scenario is for an unrestricted admin creating a full directory policy.

These scenarios require that you already have devices onboarded and reporting into Activity explorer. If you haven't onboarded devices yet, see [Get started with Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md).

In this scenario, we'll define a list of VPNs that hybrid workers use for accessing organization resources.

### Create and use a Network exception

Network exceptions enable you to configure Allow, Audit only, Block with override, and Block actions to the file activities based on the network that users are accessing the file from. You can select from the [VPN settings](dlp-configure-endpoint-settings.md#vpn-settings) list you've defined and use the **Corporate network** option. The actions can be applied individually or collectively to these user activities:

- Copy to clipboard
- Copy to a USB removable device
- Copy to a network share
- Print
- Copy or move using unallowed Bluetooth app
- Copy or move using RDP

#### Get the Server address or Network address

1. On a DLP monitored Windows device, open a **Windows PowerShell** window as an administrator.

1. Run this cmdlet:

   ```powershell-interactive
   Get-VpnConnection
   ```

1. Running this cmdlet returns multiple fields and values.

1. Find the **ServerAddress** field and record that value. You'll use this when you create a VPN entry in the VPN list.

1. Find the **Name** field and record that value. The **Name** field maps to the **Network address** field when you create a VPN entry in the VPN list.

#### Add a VPN

1. Open [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com) > **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings** > **VPN settings**.

1. Select **Add or edit VPN addresses**.

1. Provide either the **Server address** or **Network address** from running Get-VpnConnection.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Close the item.

#### Configure policy actions

1. Open **Data loss prevention** > **Policies**.

1. Select **Create policy** and select the custom policy template.

1. Select **Full directory** under **Admin units**.

1. Scope the location to **Devices** only.

1. Create a rule where:

   1. **Content contains** = **Trainable classifiers**, **Legal Affairs**
   1. **Actions** = **Audit or restrict activities on devices**
   1. Then pick **File activities on all apps**
   1. The select **Apply restrictions to specific activity**
   1. Select the actions that you want to configure **Network exceptions** for.

1. Select **Copy to clipboard** and the **Audit only** action

1. Select **Choose different copy to clipboard restrictions**.

1. Select **VPN** and set the action to **Block with override**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > When you want to control the activities of a user when they're connected through a VPN *you must* select the VPN and make the VPN the top priority in the **Network exceptions** configuration. Otherwise, if the **Corporate network** option is selected, then that action defined for the **Corporate network** entry will be enforced.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > The **Apply to all activities** option will copy the network exceptions that are defined here and apply them to all the other configured specific activities, like **Print**, and **Copy to a network share**. ***This will overwrite the network exceptions on the other activities The last saved configuration wins.***  

1. **Save**.

1. Accept the default **I'd like to test it out first** value and choose **Show policy tips while in test mode**. Choose **Next**.

1. Review your settings and choose **Submit** and then **Done**.

1. The new DLP policy will appear in the policy list.
