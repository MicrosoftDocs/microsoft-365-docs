# Configure endpoint data loss prevention settings

Many aspects of Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) behavior are controlled by centrally configured settings. Settings are applied to all DLP policies for devices.

![Endpoint DLP settings](../media/endpoint-dlp-1-using-dlp-settings.png)

You must configure these settings if you intend to control:

- Cloud egress restrictions
- Various types of restrictive actions on user activities per application.
- File path exclusions for Windows and macOS devices.
- Browser and domain restrictions.
- How business justifications for overriding policies appear in policy tips.
- If activities on Office, PDF, and CSV files are automatically audited.

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

## DLP settings

Before you get started, you should set up your DLP settings. 

### Endpoint DLP Windows 10/11 and macOS settings

|Setting |Windows 10, 1809 and later, Windows 11  |macOS Catalina 10.15 or later |Notes  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

### Advanced classification scanning and protection

Advanced classification scanning and protection allows the more advanced Microsoft Purview cloud based data classification service to scan items, classify them and return the results to the local machine. This means you can take advantage of classification techniques like [exact data match](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md) classification, and [named entities](named-entities-learn.md) in your DLP policies.

When advanced classification is turned on, content is sent from the local device to the cloud services for scanning and classification. If bandwidth utilization is a concern, you can set a limit on how much can be used in a rolling 24 hour period. The limit is configured in Endpoint DLP settings and is applied per device. If you set a bandwidth utilization limit and it's exceeded, DLP stops sending the user content to the cloud. At this point data classification continues locally on the device but classification using exact data match, named entities, and trainable classifiers aren't available. When the cumulative bandwidth utilization drops below the rolling 24 hour limit, communication with the cloud services will resume.

If bandwidth utilization isn't a concern, you select **No limit** to allow unlimited bandwidth utilization.

These Windows versions support advanced classification scanning and protection:

- Windows 10 versions 20H1/20H2/21H1 (KB 5006738)
- Windows 10 versions 19H1/19H2 (KB 5007189)
- Windows 10 RS5 (KB 5006744)

> [!NOTE]
> Support for advanced classification is available for Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and PDF file types.

> [!NOTE]
> DLP policy evaluation always occurs in the cloud, even if user content is not being sent.

### File path exclusions

Open [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com) > **Data loss prevention** > **Endpoint DLP settings** > **File path exclusions**.

You may want to exclude certain paths from DLP monitoring, DLP alerting, and DLP policy enforcement on your devices because they're too noisy or donâ€™t contain files you're interested in. Files in those locations won't be audited and any files that are created or modified in those locations won't be subject to DLP policy enforcement. You can configure path exclusions in DLP settings.

#### Windows 10 devices

You can use this logic to construct your exclusion paths for Windows 10 devices:

- Valid file path that ends with `\`, which means only files directly under folder. <br/>For example: `C:\Temp\`

- Valid file path that ends with `\*`, which means only files under subfolders. Files directly under the folder are not excluded. <br/>For example: `C:\Temp\*`

- Valid file path that ends without `\` or `\*`, which means all files directly under folder and all subfolders. <br/>For example: `C:\Temp`

- A path with wildcard between `\` from each side. <br/>For example: `C:\Users\*\Desktop\`

- A path with wildcard between `\` from each side and with `(number)` to give exact number of subfolders. <br/>For example: `C:\Users\*(1)\Downloads\`

- A path with SYSTEM environment variables. <br/>For example: `%SystemDrive%\Test\*`

- A mix of all the above. <br/>For example: `%SystemDrive%\Users\*\Documents\*(2)\Sub\`

#### macOS devices

Similar to Windows 10 devices you can add your own exclusions for macOS devices.

- File path definitions are case insensitive, so `User` is the same as `user`.

- Wildcard values are supported. So a path definition can contain a `*` in the middle of the path or at the end of the path. For example: `/Users/*/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/*`

#####  Recommended file path exclusions (preview)

For performance reasons, Endpoint DLP includes a list of recommended file path exclusions for macOS devices. These exclusions are turned on by default. You can disable them if you want by toggling the **Include recommended file path exclusions for Mac** toggle. The list includes:

- /Applications/*
- /System/*
- /usr/*
- /Library/*
- /private/*
- /opt/*
- /Users/*/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/*

### Restricted apps and app groups

#### Restricted apps

**Restricted apps** (previously called **Unallowed apps**) is a list of applications that you create. You configure what actions DLP will take when a user uses an app on the list to ***access*** a DLP protected file on a device. It's available for Windows 10 and macOS devices.

When **Access by restricted apps** is selected in a policy and a user uses an app that is on the restricted apps list to access a protected file, the activity will be `audited`, `blocked`, or `blocked with override` depending on how you configured it. That is unless the same app is a member of a **Restricted app group**, then the actions configured for activities in the **Restricted app group** override the actions configured for the access activity for the **Restricted apps** list. All activity is audited and available to review in activity explorer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not include the path to the executable, but only the executable name (such as browser.exe).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The action (`audit`, `block with override`, or `block`) defined for apps that are on the restricted apps list only applies when a user attempts to ***access*** a protected item. 

#### File activities for apps in restricted app groups

Restricted app groups are collections of apps that you create in DLP settings and then add to a rule in a policy. When you add a restricted app group to a policy you can take the actions defined in this table.

|Restricted App group option  |What it allows you to do  |
|---------|---------|
|Don't restrict file activity     |Tells DLP to allow users to access DLP protected items using apps in the app group and don't take any actions when the user attempts to **Copy to clipboard**, **Copy to a USB removable drive**, **Copy to a network drive**, and **Print** from the app.          |
|Apply a restriction to all activity     |Tells DLP to `Audit only`, `Block with override`, or `Block` when a user attempts to access a DLP protected item using an app that's in this app group         |
|Apply restrictions to a specific activity     |This setting allows a user to access a DLP protected item using an app that is in the app group and allows you to select a default action (`Audit only`, `Block`, or `Block with override`) for DLP to take when a user attempts to **Copy to clipboard**, **Copy to a USB removable drive**, **Copy to a network drive**, and **Print**.          |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Settings in a restricted app group override any restrictions set in the restricted apps list when they are in the same rule. So, if an app is on the restricted apps list and is a member of a restricted apps group, the settings of the restricted apps group is applied.

#### How DLP applies restrictions to activities

Interactions between **File activities for apps in restricted app groups**, **File activities for all apps** and the **Restricted app activities** list are scoped to the same rule.

##### Restricted app groups overrides

Configurations defined in **File activities for apps in restricted app groups** override the configurations in the **Restricted app activities** list and **File activities for all apps** in the same rule.

##### Restricted app activities and File activities for all apps

The configurations of **Restricted app activities** and **File activities for all apps** work in concert if the action defined for **Restricted app activities** is either `Audit only`, or `Block with override` in the same rule. This is because actions defined for **Restricted app activities** only apply when a user accesses a file using an app that's on the list. Once the user has access, the actions defined for activities in **File activities for all apps** apply. 

Here's an example:

If Notepad.exe is added to **Restricted appss** and **File activities for all apps** is configured to **Apply restrictions to specific activity** and both are configure like this:

|Setting in policy  |App name  |User activity  |DLP action to take  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Restricted app activities     |Notepad        |Access a DLP protected item         |Audit only         |
|File activities for all apps   |All apps        | Copy to clipboard        |Audit only         |
|File activities for all apps     |All apps         |Copy to a USB removeable device | Block       |
|File activities for all apps     |All apps         |Copy to a network share         |Audit only         |
|File activities for all apps   |All apps         |Print         |Block         |
|File activities for all apps     |All apps         |Copy or move using unallowed Bluetooth app         |Blocked         |
|File activities for all apps     |All apps         |Remote desktop services         |Block with override         |

User A opens a DLP protected file using Notepad. DLP allows the access and audits the activity. While still in Notepad, User A then tries to copy to clipboard from the protected item, this works and DLP audits the activity. User A then tries to print the protected item from Notepad and the activity is blocked.

> [!NOTE]
> When the DLP action to take in **Restricted app activities** is set to `block`, all access is blocked and the user cannot perform any activities on the file.
   
##### File activities for all apps only

If an app is not in **File activities for apps in restricted app groups** or is not in the **Restricted app activities** list or is in the **Restricted app activities** list with an action of `Audit only`, or 'Block with override`, any restrictions defined in the **File activities for all apps** are applied in the same rule.  

#### macOS devices

Just like on Windows devices, you'll now be able to prevent macOS apps from accessing sensitive data by defining them in the **Restricted app activities** list. 

> [!NOTE]
> Note that cross platform apps must be entered with their unique paths respective to the OS they are running on.

To find the full path of Mac apps:

1. On the macOS device, open **Activity Monitor**. Find and double-click the process you want to restrict

2. Choose **Open Files and Ports** tab.
  
3. For macOS apps, you need the full path name, including the name of the app.

#### Protect sensitive data from cloud synchronization apps

To prevent sensitive items from being synced to the cloud by cloud sync apps, like *onedrive.exe*, add the cloud sync app to the **Unallowed apps** list. When an unallowed cloud-sync app tries to access an item that is protected by a blocking DLP policy, DLP may generate repeated notifications. You can avoid these repeated notifications by enabling the **Auto-quarantine** option under **Unallowed apps**.  

##### Auto-quarantine (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Auto-quarantine is supported in Windows 10 only

When enabled, Auto-quarantine kicks in when an unallowed app attempts to access a DLP protected sensitive item. Auto-quarantine moves the sensitive item to an admin configured folder and can leave a placeholder **.txt** file in the place of the original. You can configure the text in the placeholder file to tell users where the item was moved to and other pertinent information.  

You can use auto-quarantine to prevent an endless chain of DLP notifications for the user and adminsâ€”see [Scenario 4: Avoid looping DLP notifications from cloud synchronization apps with auto-quarantine (preview)](endpoint-dlp-using.md#scenario-4-avoid-looping-dlp-notifications-from-cloud-synchronization-apps-with-auto-quarantine-preview).

### Unallowed Bluetooth apps

Prevent people from transferring files protected by your policies via specific Bluetooth apps.

### Browser and domain restrictions to sensitive data

Restrict sensitive files that match your policies from being shared with unrestricted cloud service domains.

#### Unallowed browsers

For Windows devices you add browsers, identified by their executable names, that will be blocked from accessing files that match the conditions of an enforced a DLP policy where the upload to cloud services restriction is set to block or block override. When these browsers are blocked from accessing a file, the end users will see a toast notification asking them to open the file through Microsoft Edge.

For macOS devices, you must add the full file path. To find the full path of Mac apps:

1. On the macOS device, open **Activity Monitor**. Find and double-click the process you want to restrict

2. Choose **Open Files and Ports** tab.
  
3. For macOS apps, you need the full path name, including the name of the app.

#### Service domains

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service domains** setting only applies to files uploaded using Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome with the [Microsoft Purview Extension](dlp-chrome-learn-about.md#learn-about-the-microsoft-purview-extension) installed.

You can control whether sensitive files protected by your policies can be uploaded to specific service domains from Microsoft Edge.

If the list mode is set to **Block**, then user will not be able to upload sensitive items to those domains. When an upload action is blocked because an item matches a DLP policy, DLP will either generate a warning or block the upload of the sensitive item.

If the list mode is set to **Allow**, then users will be able to upload sensitive items ***only*** to those domains, and upload access to all other domains isn't allowed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the service restriction mode is set to "Allow", you must have at least one service domain configured before restrictions are enforced.

Use the FQDN format of the service domain without the ending `.` 

For example:


| Input | URL matching behavior |
|---|---|
| **CONTOSO.COM** |**Matches the specified domain name, and any subsite**: <p>*://contoso.com<p>*://contoso.com/ <p>*://contoso.com/anysubsite1 <p>*://contoso.com/anysubsite1/anysubsite2 (etc) <p>**Does not match sub-domains or unspecified domains**: <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com.AU |
| ***.CONTOSO.COM** |**Matches the specified domain name, any subdomain, and any site**: <p>*://contoso.com <p>*://contoso.com/anysubsite <p>*://contoso.com/anysubsite1/anysubsite2 <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com/ <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com/anysubsite/ <p>*://anysubdomain1.anysubdomain2.contoso.com/anysubsite/ <p>*://anysubdomain1.anysubdomain2.contoso.com/anysubsite1/anysubsite2 (etc) <p>**Does not match unspecified domains** <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com.AU/ |
| **`www.contoso.com`** |**Matches the specified domain name**: <p>`www.contoso.com` <p>**Does not match unspecified domains or subdomains** <p>*://anysubdomain.contoso.com/, in this case, you have to put the FQDN domain name itself `www.contoso.com`|

#### Sensitive service domains

When you list a website in Sensitive services domains you can audit, block with override, or block users when they attempt to:

- print from a website
- copy data from a website
- save a website as local files

Each website must be listed in a website group and the user must be accessing the website through Microsoft Edge. Sensitive service domains is used in conjunction with a DLP policy for Devices. See, [Scenario 6 Monitor or restrict user activities on sensitive service domains](endpoint-dlp-using.md#scenario-6-monitor-or-restrict-user-activities-on-sensitive-service-domains) for more information.


### Additional settings for endpoint DLP

#### Business justification in policy tips

You can control how users interact with the business justification option in DLP policy tip notifications. This option appears when users perform an activity that's protected by the **Block with override** setting in a DLP policy. This is a global setting. You can choose from one the following options:

- **Show default options and custom text box**: By default, users can select either a built-in justification, or enter their own text.
- **Only show default options**: Users can only select a built-in justification.
- **Only show custom text box**: Users can only enter their own justification. Only the text box will appear in the end-user policy tip notification. 

##### Customizing the options in the drop-down menu

You can create up to five customized options that will appear when users interact with the policy notification tip by selecting the **Customize the options drop-down menu**. 


|Option |Default text  |
|---------|---------|
|option 1    | **This is part of an established business workflow**  or you can enter customized text        |
|option 2  |**My manager has approved this action** or you can enter customized text         |
|option 3   |**Urgent access required; I'll notify my manager separately** or you can enter customized text          |
|Show false positive option     |**The information in these files is not sensitive** or you can enter customized text          |
|option 5    |**Other** or you can enter customized text         |

### Always audit file activity for devices

By default, when devices are onboarded, activity for Office, PDF, and CSV files is automatically audited and available for review in activity explorer. Turn this feature off if you want this activity to be audited only when onboarded devices are included in an active policy.

File activity will always be audited for onboarded devices, regardless of whether they're included in an active policy.
