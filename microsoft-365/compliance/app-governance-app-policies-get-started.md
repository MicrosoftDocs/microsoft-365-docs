# Get started with app policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

App policies for Microsoft app governance are the way that you can implement more proactive or reactive conditions to create alerts or automatic remediation for your specific needs for app compliance in your organization.

To see the list of current app policies, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App governance > Policies**.

## Whatâ€™s available on the app policies dashboard

You can see the number of active, inactive, and audit policies, and the following information for each policy:

- **Policy name**
- **Status**

  - **Active**:  All policy evaluation and actions are active.
  - **Inactive**: All policy evaluation and actions are disabled.
  - **Audit mode**: Policy evaluation is active (alerts will trigger) but policy actions are disabled.

- **Severity**: Severity level set on any alerts triggered because of this policy being evaluated as true, which is part of the configuration of the policy.
- **Number of active alerts**: Alerts generated by the policy that have an **In Progress** or **New** status.
- **Number of total alerts**: Both active alerts and resolved alerts for this policy.
- **Last Alert Date**: Date of last generated alert due to this policy.
- **Last Modified**: Date when this policy was last changed.

The policy list is sorted by **Last modified** by default. To sort the list by another attribute, select the attribute name.

When you select a policy, you get a detailed policy pane with these additional details:

- **Description**: A more detailed explanation of the purpose of the policy.
- **Created by**: user principal name (UPN) of the account that created the policy.
- A list of the total and active alerts generated by this policy.

You can edit or delete an app policy by selecting **Edit** or **Delete** in the detailed policy pane or by selecting the vertical ellipses of the policy in the policy list.

You can also:

- Create a new policy. You can start with an app usage policy or a permissions policy.
- Export the policy list to a comma-separated value (CSV) file. For example, you could open the CVS file in Microsoft Excel and sort the policies by **Severity** and then **Number of Total Alerts**.
- Search the policy list.
