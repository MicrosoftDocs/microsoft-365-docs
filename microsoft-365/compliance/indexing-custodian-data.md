# Advanced indexing of custodian data

[!include[Purview banner](../includes/purview-rebrand-banner.md)]

When a custodian is added to an eDiscovery (Premium) case, any content that was deemed as partially indexed or had indexing errors is reindexed. This reindexing process is called *Advanced indexing*. There are many reasons that content is partially indexed or has indexing errors. This includes image files or the presence of images in a file, unsupported file types, or file sized indexing limits. For SharePoint files, Advanced indexing only runs on items are marked as partially indexed or that have indexing errors. In Exchange, email messages that have image attachments are not marked as partially indexed or with indexing errors. This means that those files will not be reindexed by the Advanced indexing process.

To learn more about processing support and partially indexed items, see:

- [Supported file types in eDiscovery (Premium)](supported-filetypes-ediscovery20.md)

- [Partially indexed items in eDiscovery](partially-indexed-items-in-content-search.md)

- [File formats indexed by Exchange Search](/exchange/file-formats-indexed-by-exchange-search-exchange-2013-help)

- [Default crawled file name extensions and parsed file types in SharePoint Server](/SharePoint/technical-reference/default-crawled-file-name-extensions-and-parsed-file-types)

## Viewing Advanced indexing results

After the Advanced indexing process is completed, you can get an understanding of the effectiveness of reprocessing.  In the Advanced indexing results view on the **Processing** tab for a case, the graph lists the number of items added to the *hybrid index*.  The hybrid index is where eDiscovery (Premium) stores the reprocessed content.

This view  also includes the number of items that require remediation and another graph of errors by file type. For more information, see:

- [Error remediation when processing data](error-remediation-when-processing-data-in-advanced-ediscovery.md)

- [Single item error remediation](single-item-error-remediation.md)

## Updating the Advanced index for custodians

When a custodian is added to an eDiscovery (Premium) case, all partially indexed items are reprocessed. However, as time passes, more partially indexed items may be added to a user's mailbox or OneDrive account.  If necessary, you can update the index for specific custodian. For more information, see [Manage custodians in an eDiscovery (Premium) case](manage-new-custodians.md#reindex-custodian-data). You can also update the index for all custodians in a case by clicking the **Update index** on the **Processing** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Updating custodian indexes is a long running process. It's recommended that you don't update indexes more than once a day in a case.
