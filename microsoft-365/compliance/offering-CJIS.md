# Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy

## CJIS overview

The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gives state, local, and federal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies access to criminal justice information (CJI) — for example, fingerprint records and criminal histories. Law enforcement and other government agencies in the United States must ensure that their use of cloud services for the transmission, storage, or processing of CJI complies with the [CJIS Security Policy](https://aka.ms/cjis-security-policy), which establishes minimum security requirements and controls to safeguard CJI.

The CJIS Security Policy integrates presidential and FBI directives, federal laws, and the criminal justice community's Advisory Policy Board decisions, along with guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Policy is periodically updated to reflect evolving security requirements.

The CJIS Security Policy defines 13 areas that private contractors such as cloud service providers must evaluate to determine if their use of cloud services can be consistent with CJIS requirements. These areas correspond closely to NIST 800-53, which is also the basis for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ([FedRAMP](offering-FedRAMP.md)), a program under which Microsoft has been certified for its Government Cloud offerings.

In addition, all private contractors who process CJI must sign the CJIS Security Addendum, a uniform agreement approved by the US Attorney General that helps ensure the security and confidentiality of CJI required by the Security Policy. It also commits the contractor to maintaining a security program consistent with federal and state laws, regulations, and standards, and limits the use of CJI to the purposes for which a government agency provided it.

## Microsoft and CJIS Security Policy

Microsoft signs the CJIS Security Addendum in states with CJIS Information Agreements. These tell state law enforcement authorities responsible for compliance with CJIS Security Policy how Microsoft's cloud security controls help protect the full lifecycle of data and ensure appropriate background screening of operating personnel with access to CJI. Microsoft continues to work with state governments to enter into CJIS Information Agreements.

Microsoft has assessed the operational policies and procedures of Microsoft Azure Government, Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 U.S. Government, and will attest to their ability in the applicable services agreements to meet FBI requirements for the use of in-scope services.

## Audits, reports, and certificates

The FBI does not offer certification of Microsoft compliance with CJIS requirements. Instead, a Microsoft attestation is included in agreements between Microsoft and a state's CJIS authority, and between Microsoft and its customers.

## Frequently asked questions

**Where can I request compliance information?**

Contact your Microsoft account representative for information on the jurisdiction you are interested in. Contact <cjis@microsoft.com> for information on which services are currently available in which states.

**How does Microsoft demonstrate that its cloud services enable compliance with my state's requirements?**

Microsoft signs an Information Agreement with a state CJIS Systems Agency (CSA); you may request a copy from your state's CSA. In addition, Microsoft provides customers with in-depth security, privacy, and compliance information. Customers may also review security and compliance reports prepared by independent auditors so they can validate that Microsoft has implemented security controls (such as ISO 27001) appropriate to the relevant audit scope.

**Where do I start with my agency's compliance effort?**

[CJIS Security Policy](https://aka.ms/cjis-security-policy) covers the precautions that your agency must take to protect CJI. In addition, your Microsoft account representative can put you in touch with those familiar with the requirements of your jurisdiction
