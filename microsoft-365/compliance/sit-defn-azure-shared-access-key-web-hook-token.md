# Azure Shared Access key / Web Hook token 

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

This SIT is also included in the [All credentials](sit-defn-all-creds.md) bundled SIT.

 ## Format

A combination of 44 characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

or

A combination of up to 76 characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

## Pattern

Any combination of 43 characters consisting of:
 
- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- forward slashes (/)
- or plus signs (+)
- ends with an equal sign (=)

for example:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE=`

or

A combination of 43 to 73 characters consisting of:

- a-z (case insensitive)
- 0-9
- percent signs (%)
- ends with a suffix '%3d' (case insensitive)

for example:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789%2F%2BABCDE%3D`

## Credential example 

`PrimaryKey=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE=;`

## Checksum

No

SITs that have checksums use a unique calculation to check if the information is valid. This means when the **Checksum** value is **Yes**, the service can make a positive detection based on the sensitive data alone. When the **Checksum** value is **No** additional (secondary) elements must also be detected  for the service to make a positive detection.

## Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used to access general [Azure resources with restricted permission](/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-security). 

It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of Base64 encoded 256-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of URL Encoded 256-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName, ID.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
- A dictionary of vocabulary

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
