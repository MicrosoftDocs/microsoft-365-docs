# Learn about retention for Yammer

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in preview and subject to change.

The information in this article supplements [Learn about retention](retention.md) because it has information that's specific to Yammer.

For other workloads, see:

- [Learn about retention for SharePoint and OneDrive](retention-policies-sharepoint.md)
- [Learn about retention for Microsoft Teams](retention-policies-teams.md)
- [Learn about retention for Exchange](retention-policies-exchange.md)

## What's included for retention and deletion

Yammer user messages and community messages can be deleted by using retention policies for Yammer, and in addition to the text in the messages, the following items can be retained for compliance reasons: Hypertext links and links to other Yammer messages.

User messages include all the names of the people in the conversation, and community messages include the community name and the message title (if supplied).

Reactions from others in the form of emoticons are not retained when you use retention policies for Yammer.

Files that you use with Yammer aren't included in retention policies for Yammer. These items have their own retention policies.

## How retention works with Yammer

Use this section to understand how your compliance requirements are met by backend storage and processes, and should be verified by eDiscovery tools rather than by messages that are currently visible in the Yammer app.

You can use a retention policy to retain data from community messages and user messages in Yammer, and delete these messages. Behind the scenes, Exchange mailboxes are used to store data copied from these messages. Data from Yammer user messages is stored in a hidden folder in the mailbox of each user included in the user message, and a similar hidden folder in a group mailbox is used for community messages.

Copies of community messages can also be stored in the hidden folder of user mailboxes when they @ mention users or notify the user of a reply. Although these messages originate as a community message, a retention policy for Yammer user messages will often include copies of community messages.

These hidden folders are not designed to be directly accessible to users or administrators, but instead, store data that compliance administrators can search with eDiscovery tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because copies of community messages can also be stored in user mailboxes, a retention policy with a delete action for Yammer user messages can result in the original community message no longer visible to users in the Yammer app.
> 
> However, a copy of the original message is still available in the hidden folder of the community group mailbox, and accessible with eDiscovery searches for compliance purposes.

Yammer messages are not affected by retention policies that are configured for Exchange mailboxes. Even though Yammer messages are stored in Exchange, this Yammer data is included only by a retention policy that's configured for the **Yammer community messages** and **Yammer user messages** locations.

> [!NOTE]
> If a user is included in an active retention policy that retains Yammer data and you a delete a mailbox of a user who is included in this policy, to retain the Yammer data, the mailbox is converted into an [inactive mailbox](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md). If you don't need to retain this Yammer data for the user, exclude the user account from the retention policy before you delete their mailbox.

After a retention policy is configured for Yammer messages, a timer job from the Exchange service periodically evaluates items in the hidden folder where these Yammer messages are stored. The timer job takes up to seven days to run. When these items have expired their retention period, they are moved to the SubstrateHolds folderâ€”a hidden folder that's in every user or group mailbox to store "soft-deleted" items before they are permanently deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> Because of the [first principle of retention](retention.md#the-principles-of-retention-or-what-takes-precedence), permanent deletion is always suspended if the same item must be retained because of another retention policy, or it is under eDiscovery holds for legal or investigative reasons.

After a retention policy is configured for Yammer messages, the paths the content takes depend on whether the retention policy is to retain and then delete, to retain only, or delete only.

When the retention policy is to retain and then delete:

![Diagram of retention flow for Yammer messages.](../media/yammerretentionlifecycle.png)

For the two paths in the diagram:

1. **If a Yammer message is edited or deleted** by the user during the retention period, the original message is immediately copied (if edited) or moved (if deleted) to the SubstrateHolds folder. The message is stored there until the retention period expires and then the message is immediately permanently deleted.

2. **If a Yammer message is not deleted** and for current messages after editing, the message is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder after the retention period expires. This action takes up to seven days from the expiry date. When the message is in the SubstrateHolds folder, it is then immediately permanently deleted. 

> [!NOTE]
> Messages in the SubstrateHolds folder are searchable by eDiscovery tools. Until messages are permanently deleted (in the SubstrateHolds folder), they remain searchable by eDiscovery tools.

When the retention policy is retain-only, or delete-only, the content's paths are variations of retain and delete.

### Content paths for retain-only retention policy

1. **If a Yammer message is edited or deleted**: A copy of the original message is immediately created in the SubstrateHolds folder and retained there until the retention period expires. Then the message is immediately permanently deleted from the SubstrateHolds folder.

2. **If the Yammer message is not modified or deleted** and for current messages after editing during the retention period: Nothing happens before and after the retention period; the message remains in its original location.

### Content paths for delete-only retention policy

1. **If the Yammer message is not deleted** during the retention period: At the end of the retention period, the message is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder. This action takes up to seven days from the expiry date. Then the message is immediately permanently deleted from the SubstrateHolds folder.

2. **If the Yammer message is deleted by the user** during the period, the item is immediately moved to the SubstrateHolds folder where it is immediately permanently deleted.


## Messages and external users

By default, a retention policy for Yammer user messages applies to all users in your organization, but not external users. You can apply a retention policy to external users if you use the **Edit** option for users included, and specify their account.

At this time, Azure B2B guest users are not supported.

## When a user leaves the organization 

If a user leaves your organization and their Microsoft 365 account is deleted, their Yammer user messages that are subject to retention are stored in an inactive mailbox. These messages remain subject to any retention policy that was placed on the user before their mailbox was made inactive, and the contents are available to an eDiscovery search. For more information, see [Inactive mailboxes in Exchange Online](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md). 

If the user stored any files in Yammer, see the [equivalent section](retention-policies-sharepoint.md#when-a-user-leaves-the-organization) for SharePoint and OneDrive.

## Limitations

Yammer retention policies are currently in preview and we're continuously working on optimizing retention functionality. In the meantime, be aware of the following limitation when you use retention for Yammer community messages and user messages:

- When you select **Edit** for the **Yammer user messages** location, you might see guests and non-mailbox users. Retention policies aren't designed for these users, so don't select them.

## Configuration guidance

If you're new to configuring retention in Microsoft 365, see [Get started with retention policies and retention labels](get-started-with-retention.md).

If you're ready to configure a retention policy for Yammer, see [Create and configure retention policies](create-retention-policies.md).
