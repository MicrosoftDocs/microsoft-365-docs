# CJK language support for eDiscovery (Premium)

Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) supports double-byte character set languages (these include Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which are collectively known as *CJK* languages) for the following advanced scenarios in a review set:

- When you [query the data in a review set](review-set-search.md).

- When you [tag documents in a review set](tagging-documents.md).

- When you [analyze case data in a review set](analyzing-data-in-review-set.md) by using near duplicate detection, email threading, and themes analytics.

## Frequently asked questions

**How do I create a search to collect items that contains CJK characters?**

You can use CJK characters for [keyword searches](building-search-queries.md#keyword-searches), [keyword queries and search conditions](keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md) when searching for content in eDiscovery (Premium). Searching for CJK characters is also supported when searching for content in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) and Content Search.

We provide CJK support for all [search operators](keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md#search-operators) and [search conditions](keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md#search-conditions), including the boolean operators **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **NEAR**.

If you're certain that content locations or items contain CJK characters, but searches aren't returning any results, click the query language-country/region icon ![Query language-country/region icon in Content search.](../media/8d4b60c8-e1f1-40f9-88ae-ee2a7eca0886.png) and select the corresponding language-country culture code value for the search. The default language/region is neutral.

**Can I search for multiple languages at once?**

It depends on your search scenario.

- When you [query data in a review set](review-set-search.md) in eDiscovery (Premium), you can search for multiple languages.

- When you [create a search to collect data](create-draft-collection.md), create separate collections for each language you're targeting. For example, if you are searching for a document that contains both Chinese and Korean, select Chinese for your first collection and select Korean for your second collection.

**I don't see the query language-country/region icon to select a language for queries in a review set. How can I specify a query language in a review set search?**

For review set queries, you don't need to specify a document language. eDiscovery (Premium) automatically detects document languages when you add content to a review set. This helps you optimize your query results in a review set.

**Can I see detected languages in [file metadata](view-documents-in-review-set.md#file-metadata)?**

No, you can't see detected languages in file metadata.

**Can I filter by document languages in a review set**?

No, you can't filter, sort, or search by document languages in a review set.

**Will this CJK release for review set scenarios affect any of my existing searches and review sets?**

No, none of your existing searches and review sets will change. You don't need to reindex existing data, and search results for English text will be the same.

**How do I change my display language to Chinese, Japanese, or Korean?**

For information about how to change display language and time zone, see [How to set language and region settings for Office 365](/office365/troubleshoot/access-management/set-language-and-region).
