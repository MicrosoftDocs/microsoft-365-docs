description: "Admins can set up a connector to import and archive EML data from Veritas into Microsoft 365. This connector lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Microsoft 365. After your archive this data, you can use compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage third-party data."

# Set up a connector to archive EML data

Use a Veritas connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive EML data to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. EML is the file extension for an email message saved to a file. The connector converts the content of an item from the source format to an email message format and then imports the item to a user mailbox.

After EML messages are stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, and retention policies and retention labels. Using an EML connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving EML data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive EML data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for EML data.](../media/EMLConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with the EML source to set up and configure an EML site.

2. Once every 24 hours, content items from the EML source are copied to the Veritas Merge1 site. During this process, the content of an EML file is converted to an email message format.

3. The EML connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, connects to the Veritas Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted message items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping process that's described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). During this process, a subfolder in the Inbox folder named **EML**is created in the user mailboxes, and the EML items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every message contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant of the content item.

## Before you begin

- Create a Veritas Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create an account, contact [Veritas Customer Support](https://globanet.com/ms-connectors-contact). You will sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the EML connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to a role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

- This Veritas data connector is in public preview in GCC environments in the Microsoft 365 US Government cloud. Third-party applications and services might involve storing, transmitting, and processing your organization's customer data on third-party systems that are outside of the Microsoft 365 infrastructure and therefore are not covered by the Microsoft 365 compliance and data protection commitments. Microsoft makes no representation that use of this product to connect to third-party applications implies that those third-party applications are FEDRAMP compliant.

## Step 1: Set up an EML Connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and create a connector for EML data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** > **EML**.

2. On the **EML** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the EML connector on the Veritas Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the EML connector on the Veritas Merge1 site. For information about configuring  the EML connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20EML%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map external users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The EML source items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the EML items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. Click **Next**, review your settings, and then go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the EML connector

After you create the EML connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **EML** connector to display the flyout page. This page contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
