# Office 365 Service Encryption

In addition to using volume-level encryption, Exchange Online, Skype for Business, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business also use Service Encryption to encrypt customer data. Service Encryption allows for two key management options:
- Microsoft manages all cryptographic keys. (This option is currently available in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Skype for Business. It is currently on the roadmap for Exchange Online.)
- The customer supplies root keys used with service encryption and the customer manages these keys using Azure Key Vault. Microsoft manages all other keys. This option is called Customer Key, and it is currently available for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. (Previously referred to as Advanced Encryption with BYOK. See [Enhancing transparency and control for Office 365 customers](https://blogs.office.com/2015/04/21/enhancing-transparency-and-control-for-office-365-customers/) for the original announcement.)

Service encryption provides multiple benefits. For example, it:
- provides rights protection and management features on top of strong encryption protection.
- includes a Customer Key option that enables multi-tenant services to provide per-tenant key management.
- provides separation of Windows operating system administrators from access to customer data stored or processed by the operating system.
- enhances the ability of Office 365 to meet the demands of customers that have compliance requirements regarding encryption.

## Customer Key
Using Customer Key, you can generate your own cryptographic keys using either an on-premises HSM or Azure Key Vault. Regardless of how the key is generated, customers use Azure Key Vault to control and manage the cryptographic keys used by Office 365. Once your keys are stored in Azure Key Vault, they can be assigned to workloads such as Exchange Online and SharePoint Online and used to as the root of the keychain used to encrypt your mailbox data and files.
One of the other benefits of using Customer Key is to control the ability of Microsoft to process customer data. This capability exists so that a customer that wants to remove data from Office 365 (such as when a customer terminates service with Microsoft or removes a portion of data stored in the cloud) can do so and use Customer Key as a technical control to ensure that no one, including Microsoft, can access or process the data. This is in addition (and a complement) to the Customer Lockbox feature that can be used to control access to customer data by Microsoft personnel.
