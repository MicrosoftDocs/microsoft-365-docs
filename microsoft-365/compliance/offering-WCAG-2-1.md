# Compliance offering: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1

## About WCAG 2.1

WCAG 2.1 provides a framework for developing web content that improves accessibility for people with disabilities, in addition to users of devices with limited graphical abilities. WCAG 2.0 was published in 2008 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization dedicated to creating web standards, and updated to WCAG 2.1 in June 2018. In 2012, WCAG 2.0 was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 40500:2012.  
  
Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. For policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance.  
  
Conformance requirements for each guideline are measured in three levels: A, AA, and AAA. Because Microsoft is a major software and cloud-services provider to states and governments around the world, it is committed to complying with all relevant [international standards and compliance controls](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2052226). By adhering to these wide-ranging accessibility standards, Microsoft ensures that all customers — both inside and outside of government — can use Microsoft services and products.  

## Microsoft and WCAG 2.1

Microsoft’s adherence to the WCAG 2.1 (ISO/IEC 40500) standard points to its commitment to making technology and data accessible for all customers. WCAG 2.1 (ISO/IEC 40500) is the international accessibility requirement that complements EN 301 549 (Europe) and Section 508 (U.S.).  
  
Microsoft publishes WCAG 2.1 reports that reflect the complete product or service. It generally does not create reports for individual features or components. Sometimes, Microsoft might release a new component for an existing product, or a new version of an existing component, which users can choose to install separately, and Microsoft might also publish a WCAG 2.1 report for that component.
