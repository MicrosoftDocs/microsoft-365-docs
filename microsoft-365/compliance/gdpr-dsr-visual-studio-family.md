# Visual Studio Family Data Subject Requests for the GDPR

The European Union [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm) gives rights to people (known in the regulation as _data subjects_) to manage their personal data. Personal data is defined very broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an electronic format. A formal request by a data subject to a data controller (an employer or other type of agency or organization that has control over personal data) to take an action on that data subject's personal data is called a _data subject request_ or DSR. For general information about GDPR, see the [GDPR section of the Service Trust portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRGetStarted).

## Products covered by this guide

This guide discusses how to use Microsoft tools to export or delete personal data collected during authenticated (signed-in) session usage of Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac and Microsoft extensions to them and to Visual Studio Code. This guide also covers how to make data subject requests for personal data collected when using Visual Studio Developer Community, NuGet.org, and the ASP.NET website. These products may enable use of non-Microsoft tools and extensions, and Microsoft is not a data processor or controller for these tools and extensions. Users should contact the tool or extension provider to understand the personal data and collection policies for these tools and extensions.

## Additional privacy information

The Microsoft Software License Terms accompanying the products, the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=660726), and [Microsoft's GDPR Commitments](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/gdpr) describe our data processing practices.

## Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, and Visual Studio Code

### Personal data we collect

As a data processor under the GDPR, Microsoft collects the data we need from users to provide experiences for and improve Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac and Microsoft extensions to them and to Visual Studio Code. There are two categories of data: customer data and system-generated logs. Customer data includes user-identifiable transactional and interactional data that these products need to perform the service they provide. For example, to provide users with personalized experiences such as roaming settings, we need to collect user account information and settings data. System-generated logs are usage or diagnostic data that are used to help identify and troubleshoot problems and improve our products and services, and may also contain identifiable information about end users, such as a user name. System-generated logs are retained for no more than 18 months. As an example, system-generated logs are aggregated for each day of product usage and include the usage date, the product used (for example, "Visual Studio 2017"), the action you took (for example, "vs/core/packagecostsummary/solutionload"), and the number of times the action was taken, as shown in this sample:

```
{Time":"2/23/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 2017","Action":"vs/core/packagecostsummary/solutionload","Target":"1 times",
"DevicePlatform":"Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}

{Time":"2/23/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 2017","Action":"vs/ide/connected/accountmanagement/account","Target":"1 times",
"DevicePlatform": "Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}

{"Time":"2/27/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 2017","Action":"vs/core/perf/satellitepagefileusage","Target":"23 times",
"DevicePlatform":"Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}
```

For more information, see [System-generated logs collected by Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/diagnostic-data-collection).

Only personal data that is attached to authenticated identities can be serviced by a DSR. So, for example, because Visual Studio Code does not support sign-in, system-generated logs from it are not attached to an authenticated identity and cannot be serviced. However, some Microsoft extensions for Visual Studio Code may provide authenticated data, and this data can be serviced by a DSR. For more information, see [GDPR and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_gdpr-and-vs-code). In general, we do not store data for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier; however, certain extensions and components may provide data attached to authenticated identities and can be serviced by a DSR as outlined below.

### How users can control personal data

Visual Studio 2015 and later, Visual Studio for Mac, and Visual Studio Code provide the following means for your users to stop data collection, and for you as controller to export, or delete data that has already been gathered.

#### In-app settings

Users can control the privacy settings for these products. For more information, see the following

- [How to manage privacy settings in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program).
- [How to manage privacy settings in Visual Studio for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mac/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program).
- [How to disable telemetry reporting in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).

#### Exporting or deleting data

Controllers can manage customer data and system-generated logs collected from their data subjects by one of two methods, depending upon how their Visual Studio Family product or Microsoft extensions were registered. In some cases, both methods must be used. Both methods allow Controllers to download a copy of their activity history managed by that method. Closure of an AAD or MSA account deletes associated Visual Studio customer data, and anonymizes personally identifiable data in system-generated logs pertaining to these products. Anonymized system-generated logs are retained for no more than 18 months.

- Users that have registered a Visual Studio Family product by using an account that is backed by an Azure tenant&mdash;for example, AAD account or  MSA account associated with an Azure subscription&mdash;can follow the instructions in [Azure Data Subject Requests for the GDPR](gdpr-dsr-azure.md).
- Users that have registered a Visual Studio Family product without an account that is backed by an Azure tenant&mdash;for example many accounts using a Microsoft Account (MSA)&mdash;can use [the web-based Microsoft Privacy Response Center](https://aka.ms/userprivacysite) available through their Microsoft account to view, control, and delete activity data tied to their Microsoft account across multiple Microsoft services. In this scenario, the user is a controller for their own personal data.

> [!NOTE]
> When an MSA account holder deletes their account, all their personally identifiable data pertaining to these products is deleted, whether the account is backed by an Azure tenant or not, and system-generated logs are anonymized.

For Visual Studio 2013, the data we collect is anonymized. For Visual Studio 2012 and prior releases, we immediately delete the data upon receipt. In both cases, there is nothing to view, export, or delete at a later time.

## Visual Studio Developer Community

## Xamarin Forums and Bugzilla

### Personal Data We Collect

Through the [Xamarin Forums](https://forums.xamarin.com) user community and [Xamarin Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/) bug reporting websites, Microsoft collects data you provide to help us reproduce and troubleshoot issues you may have with Microsoft products and services. This data includes personal data and public feedback. The personal data we collect is user account data (for example, user names and email addresses associated with your Xamarin Forums or Bugzilla accounts), and the public feedback we collect includes bugs, problems, comments, and solutions you provide via the Xamarin Forums or Xamarin Bugzilla bug reporting website.

### How You Can Control Your Data

#### Xamarin Forums

##### View

Users with active Xamarin Forums accounts may view their personal data and public feedback (for example, all of their posted threads and posts) from their Xamarin Forums account page. Users may also edit their personal data through their account page.

##### Export

Xamarin Forums are hosted by a third party, Vanilla Forums. To request export of your public data, users should contact forums@xamarin.com (monitored by the Xamarin team). We will then work directly with Vanilla Forums to process this request.

##### Delete

Xamarin Forums are hosted by a third party, Vanilla Forums. To request deletion of your personal and public data, users should contact forums@xamarin.com (monitored by the Xamarin team). We will then manually service the user's personal data deletion request.

#### Bugzilla for Xamarin

##### View

Users with active Xamarin Bugzilla accounts can view all bugs they've reported and all comments they've added to bugs by clicking the appropriate links on the Xamarin Bugzilla home page.

##### Export

Exporting of personal data is not supported.

##### Delete

To request deletion of personal data used in connection with Xamarin's Bugzilla bug reporting website, users can close their Xamarin Bugzilla account by going to the [user preferences page](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/userprefs.cgi) and choosing the **Close Account tab**. Enter your Bugzilla password and check the box confirming that you understand that this will permanently delete your account. Public feedback (for example, bugs, problems, comments, and solutions) that users have posted to the Xamarin Bugzilla will not be deleted after receipt of a delete request. Public feedback will instead be anonymized by removing the name and email address associated with any public feedback created by the user submitting the delete request.
