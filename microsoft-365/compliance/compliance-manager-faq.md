# Compliance Manager frequently asked questions

## Is Compliance Manager and Compliance Score the same thing, or are they different?

There is now just one solution: Compliance Manager. This section walks you through the transition, starting with a basic overview below. You may also find it helpful to jump directly to one of the following sections:

- [Your organization primarily used Compliance Manager (either the classic or public preview versions), located in the Microsoft Service Trust Portal](#your-organization-regularly-used-compliance-manager-in-the-service-trust-portal)

- [Your organization primarily used Compliance Score (public preview), located in the Microsoft 365 compliance center](#your-organization-used-compliance-score-public-preview-in-the-microsoft-365-compliance-center)

- [Your organization is new to Compliance Manager](#youre-new-to-compliance-manager
)
#### The basics

Microsoft Compliance Manager began as a compliance management solution inside the Microsoft Service Trust Portal.  As compliance solutions came into in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, we developed a new experience with a more user-friendly design for this location. Compliance Score public preview was released in the Microsoft 365 compliance center in November 2019. Compliance Score shared the same backend as Compliance Manager, allowing customers to work in both places. Since November 2019, we’ve released several updates as we built new functionality and responded to customer feedback.

The general availability of Compliance Manager in the Microsoft 365 compliance center in September 2020 completes this evolution. Compliance Manager is the unified, end-to-end compliance solution. Your compliance score remains a key component of Compliance Manager.

Read this [blog post](https://aka.ms/compliancemanager/GAblog) to learn more about what’s new with the GA release of Compliance Manager.

#### Your organization regularly used Compliance Manager in the Service Trust Portal

If you used Compliance Manager in the Service Trust Portal, all of your organization’s data now exists in Compliance Manager in the Microsoft 365 compliance center at https://compliance.microsoft.com/compliancemanager. There’s nothing you need to do to resume your Compliance Manager work in its new location, other than to update any bookmarks you have to its previous location. All of your assessments and other data have been brought over for you.

Note that Compliance Manager (preview) is no longer accessible in the Service Trust Portal, and all links to it will redirect you to its new location in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. Compliance Manager (classic) remains in the Service Trust Portal, though its use is discouraged.

Everything you used to do in previous versions of Compliance Manager, such as completing actions (now called “improvement actions”) and creating assessments, can be done in the new Compliance Manager. We’ve added over 150 new assessment templates and improved the template creation process. We'll add more enhancements in future releases.

#### Your organization used Compliance Score (public preview) in the Microsoft 365 compliance center

If you used Compliance Score in public preview, you’ll notice Compliance Manager looks largely the same, with your score featured prominently on your dashboard. With the GA release, you no longer need to leave the Microsoft 365 compliance center in order to perform certain assessment management functions, such as creating and modifying templates for assessments. All functionality now resides in one place. Any data you had in the preview version of Compliance Score remains in the GA version of Compliance Manager.

Note that if you filtered your Compliance Score dashboard view, those filters were reset when we deployed the new Compliance Manager in September. You will need to reapply any filters you had.

Compliance Manager also has new licensing terms. See the question below on licensing.

#### You're new to Compliance Manager

Compliance Manager is an end-to-end solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center for managing and tracking compliance activities. It’s a great place to begin your compliance journey because it gives you an initial assessment of your compliance posture the first time you visit. Below are good places to start learning more:

## Are there licensing requirements for using Compliance Manager?

Yes. The GA release of Compliance Manager contains new licensing terms. All organizations with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 licenses, and US Government Community (GCC) Moderate, GCC High, and Department of Defense (DoD) customers, have access to Compliance Manager. However, the assessments available to your organization and how you manage assessment templates depends on your licensing agreement. Visit the [Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security and compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance) for details.

## If I have a high score, does it mean I’m fully compliant?

No. Your compliance score measures your progress in completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It does not express an absolute measure of organizational compliance with regard to a particular standard or regulation. Compliance Manager, and your compliance score, should not be interpreted as a guarantee in any way.

## Can I use Compliance Manager for non-Microsoft products?

While Compliance Manager provides continuous monitoring and recommended actions only for Microsoft cloud services, you can add custom assessments in Compliance Manager for your third-party services. In this way, you can use Microsoft Compliance Manager as a SaaS compliance management tool to help you manage all the controls across your digital assets.

## What’s happening to Compliance Manager (classic) in the Service Trust Portal?

The classic version of Compliance Manager, which resides in the Microsoft Service Trust Portal, will soon be retired. A Microsoft 365 Message Center notice will go out at least 60 days before the final retirement of Compliance Manager (classic). Customers who are managing their compliance activities in Compliance Manager (classic) will need to move their data, including assessments and controls, over to the new Compliance Manager solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. Customer data will not automatically transfer over to Compliance Manager in the Microsoft 365 compliance center when Compliance Manager (classic) is retired.
