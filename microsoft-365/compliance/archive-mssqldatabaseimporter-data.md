# Set up a connector to archive data from MS SQL Database

Use a Veritas connector in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to import and archive data from MS SQL Database to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Veritas provides you with an MS SQL Database Importer connector that's configured to capture items from a database using an XML configuration file and import those items to Microsoft 365. The connector converts content from MS SQL Database to an email message format and then imports those items to user mailboxes in Microsoft 365.

After content from MS SQL Database stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft Purview features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels. Using an MS SQL Database connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving the MS SQL data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive MS SQL data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for MS SQL data.](../media/MSSQLDatabaseConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with an MS SQL Database provider to set up and configure an MS SQL Database site.

2. Once every 24 hours, MS SQL Database items are copied to the Veritas Merge1 site. The connector also converts this content to an email message format.

3. The MS SQL Database Importer connector that you create in the compliance portal, connects to the Veritas Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted MS SQL Database items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **MS SQL Database Importer** is created in the user mailboxes, and the items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every item from the MS SQL Database contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant of the item.

## Before you begin

- Create a Veritas Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create an account, contact [Veritas Customer Support](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the MS SQL Database Importer connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned the Data Connector Admin role. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the compliance portal. This role is added by default to multiple role groups. For a list of these role groups, see the "Roles in the Defender and compliance portals" section in [Roles and role groups in the Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Purview compliance portals](../security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md#roles-in-the-defender-and-compliance-portals). Alternatively, an admin in your organization can create a custom role group, assign the Data Connector Admin role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For instructions, see the "Create a custom role group" section in [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions.md#create-a-custom-role-group).

- This Veritas data connector is in public preview in GCC environments in the Microsoft 365 US Government cloud. Third-party applications and services might involve storing, transmitting, and processing your organization's customer data on third-party systems that are outside of the Microsoft 365 infrastructure and therefore aren't covered by the Microsoft Purview and data protection commitments. Microsoft makes no representation that use of this product to connect to third-party applications implies that those third-party applications are FEDRAMP compliant.

## Step 1: Set up the MS SQL Database Importer connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the compliance portal and create a connector for the MS SQL Database.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and then select **Data connectors** > **MS SQL Database Importer**.

2. On the **MS SQL Database Importer** product description page, select **Add new connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, select **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then select **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the MS SQL Database Importer connector on the Veritas Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the MS SQL Database Importer connector on the Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the MS SQL Database Importer, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20MS%20SQL%20Database%20Importer%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you select **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the compliance portal is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map MS SQL Database Importer users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The MS SQL Database items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. Select **Next**, review your settings, and go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the MS SQL Database Importer connector

After you create the MS SQL Database Importer connector, you can view the connector status in the compliance portal.

1. Go to <https://compliance.microsoft.com/> and select **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Select the **Connectors** tab and then select the **MS SQL Database** **Importer** connector to display the flyout page, which contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, select the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that's been imported to the Microsoft cloud. For more information, see [View admin logs for data connectors](data-connector-admin-logs.md).

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
