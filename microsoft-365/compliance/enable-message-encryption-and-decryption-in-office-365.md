# Enable message encryption and decryption

Office 365 Message Encryption lets email users send encrypted messages to people inside our outside their organization. As an administrator, you can enable Office 365 Message Encryption by creating mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) that set the conditions for encryption. When one of your users sends a message that matches the conditions of the rule, the message is encrypted.
  
To learn how to create mail flow rules for encryption, see [Define rules to encrypt or decrypt email messages](./define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email.md).
