# Common settings for retention policies and retention label policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Many settings for retention are common to both retention policies and retention label policies. Use the following information to help you configure these settings to proactively retain content, delete content, or bothâ€”retain and then delete the content.

For the scenarios that support these policies for retention, see:

- [Create and configure retention policies](create-retention-policies.md).
- [Create retention labels and apply them in apps](create-apply-retention-labels.md)
- [Apply a retention label to content automatically](apply-retention-labels-automatically.md)

Settings that are specific to each scenario are explained in their respective documentation.

For overview information about policies for retention and how retention works in Microsoft 365, see [Learn about retention policies and retention labels](retention.md).

## Scopes - adaptive and static

If you are unfamiliar with adaptive and static scopes, and to help you choose which one to use when you configure a policy for retention, see [Adaptive or static policy scopes for retention](retention.md#adaptive-or-static-policy-scopes-for-retention). 

When you've decided whether to use an adaptive or static scope, use the following information to help you configure it:
- [Configuration information for adaptive scopes](#configuration-information-for-adaptive-scopes)
- [Configuration information for static scopes](#configuration-information-for-static-scopes)

> [!TIP]
> If you have policies that use static scopes and you want to convert them to adaptive scopes, leave your existing policies in place while you create new policies that use adaptive scopes with the same retention settings. Validate these new policies are targeting the correct users, sites, and groups before you disable or delete the old policies with static scopes.

### Configuration information for adaptive scopes

> [!NOTE]
> Adaptive scopes as a new feature is currently in preview and subject to change. The alternative option is a static scope, which provides the same behavior before adaptive scopes were introduced and can be used if adaptive scopes don't meet your business requirements.

When you choose to use adaptive scopes, you are prompted to select what type of adaptive scope you want. There are three different types of adaptive scopes and each one supports different attributes or properties:

| Adaptive scope type | Attributes or properties supported include |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Users** - applies to:  <br/> - Exchange email <br/> - OneDrive accounts <br/> - Teams chats <br/> - Teams private channel messages <br/> - Yammer user messages| First Name <br/> Last name <br/>Display name <br/> Job title <br/> Department <br/> Office <br/>Street address <br/> City <br/>State or province <br/>Postal code <br/> Country or region <br/> Email addresses <br/> Alias <br/> Exchange custom attributes: CustomAttribute1 - CustomAttribute15|
|**SharePoint sites** - applies to:  <br/> - SharePoint sites <br/> - OneDrive accounts |Site URL <br/>Site name <br/> SharePoint custom properties: RefinableString00 - RefinableString99 |
|**Microsoft 365 Groups** - applies to:  <br/> - Microsoft 365 Groups <br/> - Teams channel messages <br/> - Yammer community messages |Name <br/> Display name <br/> Description <br/> Email addresses <br/> Alias <br/> Exchange custom attributes: CustomAttribute1 - CustomAttribute15 |

The property names for sites are based on SharePoint site managed properties, and the attribute names for users and groups are based on [filterable recipient properties](/powershell/exchange/recipientfilter-properties#filterable-recipient-properties) that map to Azure AD attributes. For example:

- **Alias** maps to the LDAP name **mailNickname**, that displays as **Email** in the Azure AD admin center.
- **Email addresses** maps to the LDAP name **proxyAddresses**, that displays as **Proxy address** in the Azure AD admin center.

The attributes and properties listed in the table can be easily specified when you configure an adaptive scope by using the simple query builder. Additional attributes and properties are supported with the advanced query builder, as described in the following section.

> [!TIP]
> For additional information about using the advanced query builder, see the following webinar: [Building Advanced Queries for Users and Groups with Adaptive Policy Scopes](https://mipc.eventbuilder.com/event/52683/occurrence/49452/recording?rauth=853.3181650.1f2b6e8b4a05b4441f19b890dfeadcec24c4325e90ac492b7a58eb3045c546ea)

A single policy for retention can have one or many adaptive scopes.

#### To configure an adaptive scope

Before you configure your adaptive scope, use the previous section to identify what type of scope to create and what attributes and values you will use. You might need to work with other administrators to confirm this information, and for SharePoint sites, confirm that the properties are indexed.

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), navigate to one of the following locations:
    
    - If you are using records management:
        - **Solutions** > **Records management** > **Adaptive scopes** tab > + **Create scope**
        
    - If you are not using records management:
       - **Solutions** > **Information governance** > **Adaptive scopes** tab > + **Create scope**
    
    Don't immediately see your solution in the navigation pane? First select **Show all**. 

2. Follow the prompts in the configuration to first select the type of scope, and then select the attributes or properties you want to use to build the dynamic membership, and type in the attribute or property values.
    
    For example, to configure an adaptive scope that will be used to identify users in Europe, first select **Users** as the scope type, and then select the **Country or region** attribute, and type in **Europe**:
    
    ![Example adaptive scope configuration.](../media/example-adaptive-scope.png)
    
    Once a day, this query will run against Azure AD and identify all users who have the value **Europe** specified for in their account for the **Country or region** attribute.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Because the query doesn't run immediately, there's no validation that you typed in the value correctly.
    
    Select **Add attribute** (for users and groups) or **Add property** (for sites) to use any combination of attributes or properties that are supported for their scope type, together with logical operators to build queries. The operators supported are **is equal to**, **is not equal to**, **starts with** and **not starts with**, and you can group selected attributes or properties. For example:
    
    ![Example adaptive scope configuration with groupings of attributes.](../media/example-adaptive-scope-grouping.png)
    
    Alternatively, you can select **Advanced query builder** to specify your own queries:
    
    - For **User** and **Microsoft 365 Group** scopes, use [OPATH filtering syntax](/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters). For example, to create a user scope that defines its membership by department, country, and state:
    
        ![Example adaptive scope with advanced query.](../media/example-adaptive-scope-advanced-query.png)
    
    - For **SharePoint sites** scopes, use Keyword Query Language (KQL). You might already be familiar with using KQL to search SharePoint by using indexed site properties. To help you specify these KQL queries, see [Keyword Query Language (KQL) syntax reference](/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference).
    
    One of the advantages of using the advanced query builder is a wider choice of query operators:
    - **and**
    - **or**
    - **not**
    - **eq** (equals)
    - **ne** (not equals)
    - **lt** (less than)
    - **gt** (greater than)
    - **like** (string comparison
    - **notlike** (string comparison
    
    You can [validate these advanced queries](#validating-advanced-queries) independently from the scope configuration.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > You must use the advanced query builder if you want to exclude inactive mailboxes. Or conversely, target just inactive mailboxes. For this configuration, use the OPATH property *IsInactiveMailbox*:
    > 
    > - To exclude inactive mailboxes, make sure the query includes: `(IsInactiveMailbox -eq "False")`
    > - To target just inactive mailboxes, specify: `(IsInactiveMailbox -eq "True")`

3. Create as many adaptive scopes as you need. You can select one or more adaptive scopes when you create your policy for retention.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to five days for the queries to fully populate and changes will not be immediate. Factor in this delay by waiting a few days before you add a newly created scope to a policy for retention.

To confirm the current membership and membership changes for an adaptive scope:

1. Double-click (or select and press Enter) the scope on the **Adaptive scopes** page

2. From the flyout **Details** pane, select **Scope details**. 
    
    Review the information that identifies all the users, sites, or groups currently in the scope, if they were automatically added or removed, and the date and time of that membership change.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [policy lookup](retention.md#policy-lookup) option to help you identify the policies that are currently assigned to specific users, sites, and Microsoft 365 groups.

#### Validating advanced queries

You can manually validate advanced queries by using PowerShell and SharePoint search:
- Use PowerShell for the scope types **Users** and **Microsoft 365 Groups**
- Use SharePoint search for the scope type **SharePoint sites**

To run a query using PowerShell:

1. [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) using an account with [appropriate Exchange Online Administrator permissions](/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions#use-powershell-to-find-the-permissions-required-to-run-a-cmdlet).

2. Use either [Get-Recipient](/powershell/module/exchange/get-recipient) or [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) with the *-Filter* parameter and your [OPATH query](/powershell/exchange/filter-properties) for the adaptive scope enclosed in curly brackets (`{`,`}`). If your attribute values are strings, enclose these values in double or single quotes.  

    You can determine whether to use `Get-Mailbox` or `Get-Recipient` for validation by identifying which cmdlet is supported by the [OPATH property](/powershell/exchange/filter-properties) that you choose for your query.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > `Get-Mailbox` does not support the *MailUser* recipient type, so `Get-Recipient` must be used to validate queries that include on-premises mailboxes in a hybrid environment.

    To validate a **User** scope, use either:
    - `Get-Mailbox` with `-RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox` or
    - `Get-Recipient` with `-RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox,MailUser`
    
    To validate a **Microsoft 365 Group** scope, use:
    - `Get-Mailbox` or `Get-Recipient` with `-RecipientTypeDetails GroupMailbox`

    For example, to validate a **User** scope, you could use:
    
    ````PowerShell
    Get-Recipient -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox,MailUser -Filter {Department -eq "Marketing"} -ResultSize Unlimited
    ````
    
    To validate a **Microsoft 365 Group** scope, you could use:
    
    ```PowerShell
    Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails GroupMailbox -Filter {CustomAttribute15 -eq "Marketing"} -ResultSize Unlimited
    ```

3. Verify that the output matches the expected users or groups for your adaptive scope. If it doesn't, check your query and the values with the relevant administrator for Azure AD or Exchange.
 
To run a query using SharePoint search:

1. Using a global admin account or an account that has the SharePoint admin role, go to `https://<your_tenant>.sharepoint.com/search`.

2. Use the search bar to specify your KQL query.

3. Verify that the search results match the expected site URLs for your adaptive scope. If they don't, check your query and the URLs with the relevant administrator for SharePoint.

### Configuration information for static scopes

When you choose to use static scopes, you must then decide whether to apply the policy to all instances for the selected location (the entire location) or to include or exclude specific instances (specific inclusions or exclusions).

#### A policy that applies to entire locations

With the exception of Skype for Business, the default is that all instances for the selected locations are automatically included in the policy without you having to specify them as included.

For example, **All recipients** for the **Exchange email** location. With this default setting, all existing user mailboxes will be included in the policy, and any new mailboxes created after the policy is applied will automatically inherit the policy.

#### A policy with specific inclusions or exclusions

Be aware that if you use the optional configuration to scope your retention settings to specific users, specific Microsoft 365 groups, or specific sites, there are some limits per policy to be aware of. For more information, see [Limits for retention policies and retention label policies](retention-limits.md). 

To use the optional configuration to scope your retention settings, make sure the **Status** of that location is **On**, and then use the links to include or exclude specific users, Microsoft 365 groups, or sites.

> [!WARNING]
> If you configure instances to include and then remove the last one, the configuration reverts to **All** for the location.  Make sure this is the configuration that you intend before you save the policy.
>
> For example, if you specify one SharePoint site to include in your retention policy that's configured to delete data, and then remove the single site, by default all SharePoint sites will then be subject to the retention policy that permanently deletes data. The same applies to includes for Exchange recipients, OneDrive accounts, Teams chat users, and so on.
>
> In this scenario, toggle the location off if you don't want the **All** setting for the location to be subject to the retention policy. Alternatively, specify exclude instances to be exempt from the policy.

## Locations

Locations in policies for retention identify specific Microsoft 365 services that support retention settings, such as Exchange email and SharePoint sites. Use the following section for the locations that have configuration details and possible exceptions that you need to be aware of when you select them for your policy.

### Configuration information for Exchange email and Exchange public folders

The **Exchange email** location supports retention for users' email, calendar, and other mailbox items, by applying retention settings at the level of a mailbox. Shared mailboxes are also supported.

Resource mailboxes, contacts, and Microsoft 365 group mailboxes aren't supported for Exchange email. For Microsoft 365 group mailboxes, select the **Microsoft 365 Groups** location instead. Although the Exchange location initially allows a group mailbox to be selected for a static scope, when you try to save the retention policy, you receive an error that "RemoteGroupMailbox" is not a valid selection for this location.

Depending on your policy configuration, [inactive mailboxes](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md) might be included or not:

- Static policy scopes include inactive mailboxes when you use the default **All recipients** configuration but aren't supported for [specific inclusions or exclusions](#a-policy-with-specific-inclusions-or-exclusions). However, if you include or exclude a recipient that has an active mailbox at the time the policy is applied and the mailbox later goes inactive, the retention settings continue to be applied or excluded.

- Adaptive policy scopes, by default, include inactive mailboxes when they meet the scope's query. You can exclude them by using the advanced query builder and the OPATH property *IsInactiveMailbox*:
    
    ```console
    (IsInactiveMailbox -eq "False")
    ```

If you use a static policy scope and choose recipients to include or exclude, you can select distribution groups and email-enabled security groups as an efficient way to select multiple recipients instead of selecting them one-by-one. When you use this option, behind the scenes, these groups are automatically expanded at the time of configuration to select the mailboxes of the users in the group. If the membership of those groups later change, your existing retention policy isn't automatically updated, unlike adaptive policy scopes.

For detailed information about which mailbox items are included and excluded when you configure retention settings for Exchange, see [What's included for retention and deletion](retention-policies-exchange.md#whats-included-for-retention-and-deletion).

The **Exchange public folders** location applies retention settings to all public folders and can't be applied at the folder or mailbox level.

#### Exceptions for auto-apply policies configured for sensitive information types

When you configure an auto-apply policy that uses sensitive information types and select the **Exchange email** location:

- Microsoft 365 group mailboxes are included.

- All mailboxes are automatically included, even if you configure an adaptive scope to identify specific mailboxes. If you've chosen a static policy scope, you won't be able to specify recipients to include or exclude.

### Configuration information for SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts

When you choose the **SharePoint sites** location, the policy for retention can retain and delete documents in SharePoint communication sites, team sites that aren't connected by Microsoft 365 groups, and classic sites. Unless you are using [adaptive policy scopes](#exceptions-for-adaptive-policy-scopes), Team sites connected by Microsoft 365 groups aren't supported with this option and instead, use the **Microsoft 365 Groups** location that applies to content in the group's mailbox, site, and files.

For detailed information about what's included and excluded when you configure retention settings for SharePoint and OneDrive, see [What's included for retention and deletion](retention-policies-sharepoint.md#whats-included-for-retention-and-deletion).

When you specify your locations for SharePoint sites or OneDrive accounts, you don't need permissions to access the sites. For static scopes, no validation is done at the time you specify the URL on the **Edit locations** page. However, the SharePoint sites that you specify are checked that they exist on the final page of the configuration. If this check fails, you see a message that validation failed for the URL you entered, and the retention policy can't be created until the validation check passes. If you see this message, go back in the configuration process to change the URL or remove the site from the retention policy.

To specify individual OneDrive accounts, see [Get a list of all user OneDrive URLs in your organization](/onedrive/list-onedrive-urls).

> [!NOTE]
> When you specify individual OneDrive accounts, be aware that unless OneDrive accounts are [pre-provisioned](/onedrive/pre-provision-accounts), the URL isn't created until a user accesses their OneDrive for the first time.
>
> Also, the OneDrive URL will [automatically change](/onedrive/upn-changes) if there is a change in the user's UPN. For example, a name-changing event such as marriage, or a domain name change to support an organization's rename or business restructuring. If the UPN changes, you will need to update the OneDrive URLs you specify for retention settings.
>
> Because of the challenges of reliably specifying URLs for individual users to include or exclude for static scopes, [adaptive scopes](retention.md#adaptive-or-static-policy-scopes-for-retention) with the **User** scope type are better suited for this purpose.

#### Exceptions for adaptive policy scopes

When you configure a policy for retention that uses adaptive policy scopes and select the **SharePoint sites** location:

- OneDrive sites and Microsoft 365 group-connected sites are included in addition to SharePoint communication sites, team sites that aren't connected by Microsoft 365 groups, and classic sites.

### Configuration information for Microsoft 365 Groups

To retain or delete content for a Microsoft 365 group (formerly Office 365 group), use the **Microsoft 365 Groups** location. For retention policies, this location includes the group mailbox and SharePoint teams site. For retention labels, this location includes the SharePoint teams site only.

> [!NOTE]
> Even though a Microsoft 365 group has an Exchange mailbox, a retention policy for the **Exchange email** location won't include content in Microsoft 365 group mailboxes.

If you use static scopes: Although the **Exchange email** location for a static scope initially allows you to specify a group mailbox to be included or excluded, when you try to save the retention policy, you'll see an error that "RemoteGroupMailbox" is not a valid selection for the Exchange location.

By default, a retention policy applied to a Microsoft 365 group includes the group mailbox and SharePoint teams site. Files stored in the SharePoint teams site are covered with this location, but not Teams chats or Teams channel messages that have their own retention policy locations.

To change the default because you want the retention policy to apply to either just the Microsoft 365 mailboxes, or just the connected SharePoint teams sites, use the [Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy) PowerShell cmdlet with the *Applications* parameter with one of the following values:

- `Group:Exchange` for just Microsoft 365 mailboxes that are connected to the group.
- `Group:SharePoint` for just SharePoint sites that are connected to the group.

To return to the default value of both the mailbox and SharePoint site for the selected Microsoft 365 groups, specify `Group:Exchange,SharePoint`.

#### Exceptions for auto-apply policies configured for sensitive information types

When you configure an auto-apply policy that uses sensitive information types and select the **Microsoft 365 Groups** location:

- Microsoft 365 group mailboxes aren't included. To include these mailboxes in your policy, select the **Exchange email** location instead.

#### What happens if a Microsoft 365 group is deleted after a policy is applied

When a policy for retention (static policy scope or adaptive) is applied to a Microsoft 365 group, and that group is then deleted from Azure Active Directory:

- The group-connected SharePoint site is preserved and continues to be managed by the retention policy with the **Microsoft 365 Groups** location. The site is still accessible to the people who had access to it before the group was deleted, and any new permissions must now be managed via SharePoint.
    
    At this point, you can't exclude the site from the Microsoft 365 Groups location, because you can't specify the deleted group. If you need to release the retention policy from this site, contact Microsoft Support. For example, open a [service request in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/support).

- The mailbox for the deleted group becomes inactive and like the SharePoint site, remains subject to retention settings. For more information, see [Inactive mailboxes in Exchange Online](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md).

### Configuration information for Skype for Business

> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business was [retired July 31, 2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/skype-for-business-online-to-be-retired-in-2021/ba-p/777833) and we encourage customers to migrate to Microsoft Teams. However, retention policies for Skype for Business continues to be supported for existing customers.

Unlike Exchange email, you can't toggle the status of the Skype location on to automatically include all users, but when you turn on that location, you must then manually choose the users whose conversations you want to retain:

![Choose Skype location for retention policies.](../media/skype-location-retention-policies.png)

After you select this **Edit** option, in the **Skype for Business** pane you can quickly include all users by selecting the hidden box before the **Name** column. However, it's important to understand that each user counts as a specific inclusion in the policy. So if you include 1,000 users by selecting this box, it's the same as if you manually selected 1,000 users to include, which is the maximum supported for Skype for Business.

Be aware that **Conversation History**, a folder in Outlook, is a feature that has nothing to do with Skype archiving. **Conversation History** can be turned off by the end user, but archiving for Skype is done by storing a copy of Skype conversations in a hidden folder that is inaccessible to the user but available to eDiscovery.

## Settings for retaining and deleting content

By choosing the settings for retaining and deleting content, your policy for retention will have one of the following configurations for a specified period of time:

- Retain-only

    For this configuration, choose **Retain items for a specific period** and **At end of the retention period: Do nothing**. Or, select **Retain items forever**.

- Retain and then delete

    For this configuration, choose **Retain items for a specific period** and **At end of the retention period: Delete items automatically**.

- Delete-only

    For this configuration, choose **Only delete items when they reach a certain age**.

### Retaining content for a specific period of time

When you configure a retention label or policy to retain content, you choose to retain items for a specific number of days, months, or years. Or alternatively, retain the items forever. The retention period is not calculated from the time the policy was assigned, but according to the start of the retention period specified.

For the start of the retention period, you can choose when the content was created or, supported only for files and the SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft 365 Groups, when the content was last modified. For retention labels, you can start the retention period from the content was labeled, and when an event occurs.

Examples:

- SharePoint: If you want to retain items in a site collection for seven years after this content is last modified, and a document in that site collection hasn't been modified in six years, the document will be retained for only another year if it's not modified. If the document is edited again, the age of the document is calculated from the new last modified date, and it will be retained for another seven years.

- Exchange: If you want to retain items in a mailbox for seven years, and a message was sent six years ago, the message will be retained for only one year. For Exchange items, the age is based on the date received for incoming email, or the date sent for outgoing email. Retaining items based on when it was last modified applies only to site content in OneDrive and SharePoint.

At the end of the retention period, you choose whether you want the content to be permanently deleted:

![Retention settings page.](../media/b05f84e5-fc71-4717-8f7b-d06a29dc4f29.png)

### Deleting content that's older than a specific age

A policy for retention can retain and then delete items, or delete old items without retaining them.

In both cases, if your policy deletes items, it's important to understand that the time period you specify is not calculated from the time the policy was assigned, but according to the start of the retention period specified. For example, from the time when the item was created or modified, or labeled.

For this reason, first consider the age of the existing content and how the policy may impact that content. You might also want to communicate the new policy to your users before assigning it, to give them time to assess the possible impact.

### A policy that applies to entire locations

When you choose locations, with the exception of Skype for Business, the default setting is **All** when the status of the location is **On**.

When a retention policy applies to any combination of entire locations, there is no limit to the number of recipients, sites, accounts, groups, etc., that the policy can include.

For example, if a policy includes all Exchange email and all SharePoint sites, all sites and recipients will be included, no matter how many. And for Exchange, any new mailbox created after the policy is applied will automatically inherit the policy.

### A policy with specific inclusions or exclusions

Be aware that if you use the optional configuration to scope your retention settings to specific users, specific Microsoft 365 groups, or specific sites, there are some limits per policy to be aware of. For more information, see [Limits for retention policies and retention label policies](retention-limits.md). 

To use the optional configuration to scope your retention settings, make sure the **Status** of that location is **On**, and then use the links to include or exclude specific users, Microsoft 365 groups, or sites.

> [!WARNING]
> If you configure includes and then remove the last one, the configuration reverts to **All** for the location.  Make sure this is the configuration that you intend before you save the policy.
>
> For example, if you specify one SharePoint site to include in your retention policy that's configured to delete data, and then remove the single site, by default all SharePoint sites will then be subject to the retention policy that permanently deletes data. The same applies to includes for Exchange recipients, OneDrive accounts, Teams chat users etc.
>
> In this scenario, toggle the location off if you don't want the **All** setting for the location to be subject to the retention policy. Alternatively, specify excludes to be exempt from the policy.

## Updating policies for retention

Some settings can't be changed after a policy for retention is created and saved, which include:
- The policy name and the retention settings except the retention period and when to start the retention period.

If you edit a retention policy and items are already subject to the original settings in your retention policy, your updated settings will be automatically applied to these items in addition to items that are newly identified.

Usually this update is fairly quick but can take several days. When the policy replication across your Microsoft 365 locations is complete, you'll see the status of the retention policy in the Microsoft 365 compliance center change from **On (Pending)** to **On (Success)**.

## Locking the policy to prevent changes

If you need to ensure that no one can turn off the policy, delete the policy, or make it less restrictive, see [Use Preservation Lock to restrict changes to retention policies and retention label policies](retention-preservation-lock.md).
