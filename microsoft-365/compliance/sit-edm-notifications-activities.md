# Create notifications for exact data match activities

When you [create custom sensitive information types with exact data match (EDM)](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md) there are a number of activities that are created in the [audit log](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#requirements-to-search-the-audit-log). You can use the [New-ProtectionAlert](/powershell/module/exchange/new-protectionalert?view=exchange-ps) PowerShell cmdlet to create notifications that let you know when these activities occur:

- CreateSchema
- EditSchema
- RemoveSchema
- UploadDataFailed
- UploadDataCompleted

## Pre-requisites

The account you use must be one of the following:

- a global admin
- compliance administrator
- Exchange Online administrator

To learn more about DLP permissions, seeÂ [Permissions](data-loss-prevention-policies.md#permissions).

EDM-based classification is included in these subscriptions

- Office 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance
- Microsoft E5/A5 Information Protection and Governance

To learn more about DLP licensing, see [Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection)

## Configure notifications for EDM activities

1. Connect to the [Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps) 

2. Run the `New-ProtectionAlert` cmdlet using the activity that you want to create the notification for.  For example, if you want to be notified when the **UploadDataCompleted** action occured, run

```powershell
New-ProtectionAlert -Name "EdmUploadCompleteAlertPolicy" -Category Others -NotifyUser <***address to send  notification to***> -ThreatType Activity -Operation UploadDataCompleted -Description "Custom alert policy to track when EDM upload Completed" -AggregationType None
```

for the **UploadDataFailed** you can run

```powershell
New-ProtectionAlert -Name "EdmUploadFailAlertPolicy" -Category Others -NotifyUser <***SMTP address to send notification to***> -ThreatType Activity -Operation UploadDataFailed -Description "Custom alert policy to track when EDM upload Failed" -AggregationType None -Severity High
```
