- [Increase classifier accuracy (preview)](data-classification-increase-accuracy.md) - This article shows you how to confirm whether items matched by a classifier are true positive (a Match) or a false positive (Not a match) and provide Match, or Not a match feedback. You can use that feedback to tune your classifiers to increase accuracy. You can also send redacted versions of the document and the Match, Not a Match feedback to Microsoft if you want to help increase the accuracy of the classifiers that Microsoft provides.

### Data lifecycle management and records management

That status can be "Approved for deletion, 'Awaiting deletion from SharePoint/OneDrive' or 'Awaiting deletion from Exchange', or "Permanently Deleted". When an item is approved for permanent deletion as part of the disposition review process, that deletion can take up to 15 days to complete and this new column helps you to track its progress.
- The configuration to [enable a mailbox for archiving](enable-archive-mailboxes.md) is moving to the new Exchange admin center (EAC) and instructions have been updated accordingly.
