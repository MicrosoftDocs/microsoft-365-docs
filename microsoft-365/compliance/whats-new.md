### Data lifecycle management and records management

- **General availability (GA)**: Auto-labeling retention policies for [cloud attachments](apply-retention-labels-automatically.md#auto-apply-labels-to-cloud-attachments) that are shared via Yammer are now in general availability.

### Data loss prevention

- **General availability (GA)**: Oversharing Popup for Outlook Win 32. [Scenario 2 Show policy tip as oversharing popup](dlp-create-deploy-policy.md#scenario-2-show-policy-tip-as-oversharing-popup) and [Business justification X-Header](dlp-policy-reference.md#business-justification-x-header).

### Insider risk management

- **New Alert ID field and Case ID field**: New static ID fields make it easier to search for alerts, and track and share alerts between admins
- **Assign an alert feature**: Ability to [assign an alert to a specific admin](insider-risk-management-activities.md#assign-an-alert) makes it easier for admins to prioritize and triage alerts.
- Update to clarify that there's [no limit on the number of users for forensic evidence policies](insider-risk-management-policy-templates.md#policy-template-limits) 

### Sensitivity labels

- **General availability (GA)**: Now rolling out, Outlook for Android and Outlook for iOS support a setting for mandatory labeling that you can configure with Microsoft Intune to [prompt users to select a sensitivity label when they first compose an email](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#for-outlook-mobile-change-when-users-are-prompted-for-a-label) instead of when they send it.
- **General availability (GA)**: Outlook for Android and Outlook for iOS, the [sensitivity bar](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#sensitivity-bar) and [label colors](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#label-colors) are now in general availability. For iOS, the release is still rolling out.
- **In preview**: Now rolling out in preview, OneDrive locations for [auto-labeling policies](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically.md#how-to-configure-auto-labeling-policies-for-sharepoint-onedrive-and-exchange) are changing from sites specified by URLs to users and groups. This change of configuration means that [administrative units](microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions.md#administrative-units-preview) are now supported for OneDrive auto-labeling policies. Any existing OneDrive sites specified in auto-labeling policies as site URLs will continue to work but before you can add more OneDrive locations, or for restricted admins, you must first delete any existing OneDrive sites specified as URLs. Groups supported: distribution groups, Microsoft 365 groups, mail-enabled security groups, and security groups.

    - Attachment or document property is
    - Attachment or document size equals or is greater than
    - Document created by
- **In preview**: A **Contextual Summary** tab is added to auto-labeling policies that are in simulation. Similar to [other solutions that support contextual summary](data-classification-increase-accuracy.md), when you select an item to review, this new tab highlights the matched content and its surrounding context. Use this tab to confirm that the match is positive and therefore suitable to turn on the policy. Or, the match is negative, in which case you can fine-tune the policy and rerun simulation.
- **Removal of limitations for Teams when using sensitivity labels**: Several previous limitations are removed for [Teams protected meetings](sensitivity-labels-meetings.md), which include Safari and Firefox support to prevent copy chat, support for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), policy settings for justification for changing a label, mandatory labeling, and a help link to a custom help page, and more methods are now supported to prevent copying chat.
