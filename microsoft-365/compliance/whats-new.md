The wait is over. We're pleased to announce that the Microsoft 365 compliance center is available to all customers with Microsoft 365, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and Windows 10 Enterprise plans. Any data or policies you were managing in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center are available in the compliance center, so no need to jump back and forth.

We also released new and updated solutions this month. Here's a quick glance at the highlights.

### Now in preview

**Insider risk management (preview)**

We're happy to announce that our insider risk management solution is now in public preview. In a nutshell, insider risk management helps your organization intelligently identify and take action on insider risks by providing:

- Anonymity controls to help ensure user privacy.
- Intelligent policy templates with native and third-party indicators that identify insider threats, such as data leaks.
- Integrated end-to-end investigation workflows that span across IT, HR and legal teams.

We'd love to hear what you think. As you use the solution, leave us feedback so we can make sure we're meeting your needs as we head toward general availability.

### Just launched

**Communication compliance**

Graduating from the preview phase to full availability, communication compliance is a key component of our new insider risk solution set. This robust solution helps minimize communication risks using workflows for detecting, investigating, and taking remediation actions for messages that don't meet your organization's standards.

Customer feedback during the preview was fantastic. It resulted in several enhancements, including a first-run experience to get you started, improvements to investigation and remediation actions, and more.

**Data connectors**

Formerly sharing space with other 'Import' features in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, data connectors now have their very own home in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. Use the new 'Data connectors' page to import and archive data from your organization's human resources (HR) files and various third-party platforms (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instant Bloomberg) to mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Once imported, this data can be managed in several compliance solutions, including eDiscovery, insider risk management, communication compliance, audit, retention policies, and more.

## September 2019

Wondering why it's quiet on the release front this month? We're heads down building new, innovative compliance solutions that'll be unveiled at [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite) in November. Stay tuned!

### New encryption options for sensitivity labels 

When configuring encryption for a sensitivity label, you now have two options that lets users assign permissions when they manually apply the label to email and docs:<br>
- When applying the label to **Outlook email**, users can enforce restrictions equivalent to the Do Not Forward option. Recipients will be able to read the message but not forward, print, or copy the content.
- When applying the label to **Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files**, users will be prompted to assign access permissions to specific users and groups.

## August 2019

### Update to data investigations

When performing a data investigation, you can now delete items from their original locations. This means you can delete items from Exchange mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive accounts across your organization. Because you collected the items as evidence, you'll have copies of them retained in the evidence set to you can investigate further or just keep as a reference.

## July 2019

### New admin roles

We released two new admin roles to help manage security and compliance in your org. Tell all your friends.

- **Compliance data admin**. Users with this role have permissions to protect and track data in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, and Azure. They can also manage everything the Exchange admin center, Compliance Manager, Teams & Skype for Business admin center and create support tickets for Azure and Microsoft 365.

[Learn more about these roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security//office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-compliance-security)

### Search and filtering for reports

No more scrolling through a sea of reports to find the ones you want. You can now search for reports (based on their titles) and filter on categories like 'Labels' and 'Compliance' and sources like 'Office 365' and 'Microsoft Cloud App Security'.

![Screen capture of the search and filter buttons for reports with an applied filter](../media/mcc_report_filtering.png)
