### Spotlight: New content for insider risk solutions

The Microsoft 365 compliance content team is hard at work creating ‘content solution’ docs to promote how compliance capabilities can be used together to help meet your compliance goals.

First up is content that ties together our insider risk solutions: communication compliance, insider risk management, information barriers, and privileged access management. Here’s a peek at what you’ll find:

- [New landing page for insider risk solutions](insider-risk-solution-overview.md). Includes details about risks that the solutions can help mitigate, licensing requirements, deployment sequence, architecture illustrations, training resources, and more.
- New overview articles for each insider risk solution. Guidance and links to articles that help you learn about, plan, deploy, and manage each solution:
  - [Communication compliance](communication-compliance-solution-overview.md)
  - [Insider risk management](insider-risk-management-solution-overview.md)
  - [Information barriers](information-barriers-solution-overview.md)
  - [Privileged access management](privileged-access-management-solution-overview.md)
  
More content solution docs coming soon!

### Advanced eDiscovery

Improved workflow and functionality for [adding custodians](add-custodians-to-case.md) and [non-custodial data sources](non-custodial-data-sources.md) to an Advanced eDiscovery case.

### Data connectors

[Four new Veritas connectors released](archiving-third-party-data.md#third-party-data-connectors): Redtail Speak, Salesforce Chatter, ServiceNow, and Yieldbroker.

### Encryption

Introducing [Customer Key for Microsoft 365 at the tenant level](customer-key-tenant-level.md). Using keys you provide, you can create a data encryption policy (DEP) and assign it to the tenant. The DEP encrypts data across the tenant for these workloads:

- Teams chat messages (1:1 chats, group chats, meeting chats and channel conversations)
- Teams media messages (images, code snippets, videos, wiki images)
- Teams call and meeting recordings stored in Teams storage
- Teams chat notifications
- Teams chat suggestions by Cortana
- Teams status messages
- User and signal information for Exchange Online

### Records management

The [Records Management admin role group](get-started-with-records-management.md#permissions-required-for-records-management) now grants permissions for all records management features, including disposition review.

### Sensitivity labels

- [Automatically label data in Azure Purview (preview)](/azure/purview/create-sensitivity-label). You can now create and automatically apply sensitivity labels to assets in Azure Purview, such as files in Azure Blob storage and database columns in SQL Server.
- [Require users to apply a label to items](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#require-users-to-apply-a-label-to-their-email-and-documents). Also known as ‘mandatory labeling’, this new option requires users to choose and apply a sensitivity label under the specific scenarios.

## November 2020
Just a reminder that we often release new and updated features in a preview state to learn how they're being used so we can hone and improve them before releasing to general availability. Your feedback is critical during preview (and beyond), so be sure to let us know what you think by opening the Feedback card at the bottom right of the compliance center.

![feedback](../media/Feedback_card_MCC.JPG)

### Spotlight: Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) released

[Endpoint DLP](endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md) extends the activity monitoring and protection capabilities of DLP to sensitive info on Windows 10 devices. After devices are [onboarded](dlp-configure-endpoints.md) to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, you can set up DLP policies to protect the sensitive info on those devices.

### Advanced eDiscovery

To make it easier to manage encrypted content in the eDiscovery workflow, Microsoft 365 eDiscovery tools now incorporate [decryption of encrypted files](ediscovery-decryption.md) that are attached to email messages and sent in Exchange. Additionally, encrypted documents stored in SharePoint and OneDrive are decrypted in Advanced eDiscovery.

### Compliance Manager

- [Support for Microsoft 365 Government subscriptions](compliance-manager.md). Compliance Manager is now available to US Government Community (GCC) Moderate and High customers.
- [Microsoft Compliance Configuration Analyzer for Compliance Manager](compliance-manager-mcca.md). New PowerShell-based tool that helps you get started with Compliance Manager by scanning your organization’s current configurations and validating them against Microsoft 365 recommended best practices.
- [New templates](compliance-manager-templates-list.md). Added 56 new templates, bringing total Compliance Manager templates to over 230.

### Data connectors

[Five new Veritas connectors in preview](archiving-third-party-data.md#third-party-data-connectors). New connectors include Reuters Dealing, Reuters FX, CellTrust, XIP, generic MS SQL Database data.

### Retention labels (disposition review)

To view items during a disposition review, users must now be members of the [Content Explorer Content Viewer and Content Explorer List Viewer role groups](disposition.md#permissions-for-disposition). Although required to review items, these role groups aren’t necessary for completing the disposition review.

### Sensitivity labels

- [(Preview) External sharing settings for SharePoint sites](sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites.md#how-to-configure-groups-and-site-settings). When creating a label that will be used for groups and sites, you’ll see an option to control external sharing for SharePoint sites that have the label applied. You can specify that sharing is allowed for anyone, new and existing guests, existing guests only, or just users in your organization. When the label is applied, the label settings will replace any external sharing settings [configured in the SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/change-external-sharing-site).
- [Remove label and encryption from a labeled document](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.md#remove-encryption-for-a-labeled-document). To remove both a label and the encryption it enforces from a labeled document in SharePoint, global admins and SharePoint admins can run the new `Unlock-SPOSensitivityLabelEncryptedFile` cmdlet. This cmdlet runs even if the admin doesn't have access permissions to the site or file, or if the Azure Rights Management service is unavailable.

## October 2020

### Advanced eDiscovery

[CJK language support](ediscovery-cjk-support.md). Advanced eDiscovery now supports double-byte character set languages, collectively known as CJK languages (includes Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). These can be used in several advanced review set scenarios.

### Sensitivity labels

- [Label scope](sensitivity-labels.md#label-scopes). When creating a sensitivity label, you’ll see a new option to define the scope for the label. This option lets you configure labels just for files and emails, containers (like SharePoint sites and Teams), or both.
- [Dynamic content marking](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#dynamic-markings-with-variables). When configuring content marking for a sensitivity label, you can now use the dynamic variables such as `${Item.Label}` and `${Item.Location}` in the text string for your header, footer, or watermark.
