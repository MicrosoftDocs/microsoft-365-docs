description: "Administrators can set up a native connector to import Twitter data into Office 365. This lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Office 365 so you can use compliance features such as legal hold, Content Search, and retention policies to manage the governance of your organization's third-party data."

# Use a sample connector to archive Twitter data in Office 365 (Preview)

The sample connector feature to archive Twitter data in Office 365 is in Preview.

Use a sample connector in the Security & Compliance Center in Office 365 to import and archive data from Twitter. After you set up and configure a sample connector, it connects to your organization's Twitter account (on a scheduled basis), converts the content of an item to an email message format, and then imports those items to a mailbox in Office 365.

After Twitter data is imported, you can apply Office 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, Content Search, In-Place Archiving, Auditing, [Communication compliance](communication-compliance.md), and Office 365 retention policies to the data stored in the mailbox. For example, you can search Twitter data using Content Search or associate the mailbox where the data is stored with a custodian in an Advanced eDiscovery case. Using a sample connector to import and archive Twitter data in Office 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only the sample connectors for Twitter and [Facebook Business pages](archive-facebook-data-with-sample-connector.md) are available for Preview. More sample connectors are coming soon.


## Prerequisites for setting up a connector for Twitter

Complete the following prerequisites before you can set up and configure a sample connector in the Security & Compliance Center to import and archive data from your organization's Twitter account. 

- You need a Twitter account for your organization; you need to sign in to this account when setting up the connector.

- Your organization must have a valid Azure subscription. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you can sign up for one of these options:

    - [Sign up for a free one year Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) 

    - [Sign up for a Pay-As-You-Go Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The [free Azure Active Directory subscription](use-your-free-azure-ad-subscription-in-office-365.md) that's included with your Office 365 subscription doesn't support the sample connectors in the Security & Compliance Center.

- Your organization must consent to allow the Office 365 Import service to access mailbox data in your organization. To consent to this request, go to [this page](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=570d0bec-d001-4c4e-985e-3ab17fdc3073&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com/&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent), sign in with the credentials of an Office 365 global admin, and then accept the request.

- The user who sets up the custom connector in the Security & Compliance (in Step 7) must be assigned the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. By default, this role isn't assigned to any role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a new role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Download the pre-built connector app package from GitHub

The first step is to download the source code for the Twitter sample connector app that will use a Twitter API to connect to your Twitter account and extract data so you can import it to Office 365.

1. Go to [this GitHub site](https://github.com/microsoft/m365-sample-twitter-connector-csharp-aspnet/releases). 
2. Under the latest release, select the **SampleConnector.zip** file.
3. Save the ZIP file to a location on your local computer. You upload this zip file to Azure in Step 4.

## Step 2: Create an app in Azure Active Directory

The next step is to register a new app in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This app corresponds to the web app resource that you implement in Step 4 for the Twitter connector. 

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 2: Create an app in Azure Active Directory](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-2-create-an-app-in-azure-active-directory).

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you'll save the following information to a text file. These values will be used in later steps in the deployment process.

- AAD application ID
- AAD application secret
- AAD application Uri
- Tenant Id

## Step 3: Create an Azure Storage account

The Twitter connector that you deploy for your organization uploads the items from Twitter to the Azure Storage location that you create in this step. After you create a custom connector in the Security & Compliance Center (in Step 7), the Office 365 Import service will copy the Twitter data from the Azure Storage location to a mailbox in Office 365. As previous explained in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-for-setting-up-a-connector-for-twitter) section, you must have a valid Azure subscription to create an Azure Storage account.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 3: Create an Azure Storage account](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-3-create-an-azure-storage-account).

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you save the connection string Uri that is generated. You use this string when creating a web app resource in Azure in Step 4.

## Step 4: Create a web app resource in Azure

The next step is to create a web app resource in Azure for the Twitter connector. 

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 4: Create a new web app resource in Azure](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-4-create-a-new-web-app-resource-in-azure).

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you'll provide the following information (that you've copied to a text file after completing the previous steps) when creating the web app resource.

- APISecretKey – You create this secret during the completion of this step; it's used in Step 7.
- StorageAccountConnectionString – The connection string Uri that you copied after creating the Azure Storage account in Step 3.
- tenantId – The tenant ID of your Office 365 organization that you copied after creating the Twitter connector app in Azure Active Directory in Step 2.

Also, you upload the SampleConnector.zip file (that you downloaded in Step 1) in this step to deploy the source code for the Twitter connector app.

After completing this step, be sure to copy the Azure app service URL (for example, `https://twitterconnector.azurewebsites.net`). You need to use this URL to complete Step 5, Step 6, and Step 7).

## Step 5: Create developer app on Twitter

The next step is to create and configure a developer app on Twitter. The custom connector that you create in Step 7 uses the Twitter app to interact with the Twitter API to obtain data from your organization's Twitter account.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 5: Create the Twitter app](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-5-create-the-twitter-app).

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you save the following information to a text file. These values will be used to configure the Twitter connector app in Step 6.

- Twitter API Key
- Twitter API Secret Key
- Twitter Access Token
- Twitter Access Token Secret

## Step 6: Configure the Twitter connector app

The next step is to add configurations settings to the Twitter connector app that you uploaded when you created the Azure web app resource in Step 4. You do this by going to the home page of your connector app and configuring it.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 6: Configure the connector web app](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-6-configure-the-connector-web-app).

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you'll provide the following information (that you've copied to a text file after completing the previous steps):

- Twitter API Key (obtained in Step 5)
- Twitter API Secret Key (obtained in Step 5)
- Twitter Access Token (obtained in Step 5)
- Twitter Access Token Secret (obtained in Step 5)
- Azure Active Directory application ID (the AAD application ID obtained in Step 2)
- Azure Active Directory application secret (the AAD application secret obtained in Step 2)
- Azure Active Directory application Uri (the AAD application Uri obtained in Step 2; for example, `https://microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/2688yu6n-12q3-23we-e3ee-121111123213)`

## Step 7: Set up a custom connector in the Security & Compliance Center

The final step is to set up the custom connector in the Security & Compliance Center that imports data from your organization's Twitter account to a specified mailbox in Office 365. After you successfully complete this step, the Office 365 Import service will start importing data from Twitter to Office 365. 

For step-by-step instructions, see [Step 7: Set up a custom connector in the security and compliance center](deploy-twitter-connector.md#step-7-set-up-a-custom-connector-in-the-security-and-compliance-center). 

During the completion of this step (by following the step-by-step instructions), you'll provide the following information (that you've copied to a text file after completing the steps).

- Azure app service URL (obtained in Step 4; for example, `https://twitterconnector.azurewebsites.net`)
- APISecretKey (that you created in Step 4)
