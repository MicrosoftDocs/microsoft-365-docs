# Set up a connector to archive CellTrust data

Use a Veritas connector in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to import and archive data from the CellTrust platform to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Veritas provides a [CellTrust](https://globanet.com/celltrust/) connector that captures items from the third-party data source and imports those items to Microsoft 365. The connector converts the content of SMS messages from CellTrust accounts to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After CellTrust data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft Purview features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels, and communication compliance. Using a CellTrust connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving CellTrust data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive CellTrust data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for CellTrust data.](../media/CellTrustConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with CellTrust to set up and configure a CellTrust site.

2. Once every 24 hours, CellTrust items are copied to the Veritas Merge1 site. The connector also converts the content of a message to an email message format.

3. The CellTrust connector that you create in the compliance portal connects to the Veritas Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The automatic user mapping as connector imports items to the mailboxes of specific users by using the value of the *Email* property of the described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **CellTrust** is created in the user mailboxes, and the message items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every CellTrust item contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant.

## Before you begin

- Create a Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create an account, contact [Veritas Customer Support](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the CellTrust connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned the Data Connector Admin role. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the compliance portal. This role is added by default to multiple role groups. For a list of these role groups, see the "Roles in the security and compliance centers" section in [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](../security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md#roles-in-the-security--compliance-center). Alternatively, an admin in your organization can create a custom role group, assign the Data Connector Admin role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For instructions, see the "Create a custom role group" section in [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions.md#create-a-custom-role-group).

- This Veritas data connector is in public preview in GCC environments in the Microsoft 365 US Government cloud. Third-party applications and services might involve storing, transmitting, and processing your organization's customer data on third-party systems that are outside of the Microsoft 365 infrastructure and therefore are not covered by the Microsoft Purview and data protection commitments. Microsoft makes no representation that use of this product to connect to third-party applications implies that those third-party applications are FEDRAMP compliant.

## Step 1: Set up the CellTrust connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** in the compliance portal and create a connector for CellTrust data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** \> **CellTrust**.

2. On the **CellTrust** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the CellTrust connector on the Veritas Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the CellTrust connector on the Veritas Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the CellTrust connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20CellTrust%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the compliance portal is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector set up in the compliance portal, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map CellTrust users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The CellTrust items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. Click **Next**, review your settings, and go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the CellTrust connector

After you create the CellTrust connector, you can view the connector status in the compliance portal.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **CellTrust** connector to display the flyout page, which contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that's been imported to the Microsoft cloud. For more information, see [View admin logs for data connectors](data-connector-admin-logs.md).

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
