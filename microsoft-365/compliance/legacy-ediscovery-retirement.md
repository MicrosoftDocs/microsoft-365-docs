# Retirement of legacy eDiscovery tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The functionality of the legacy eDiscovery tools described in this article has either been removed from the Microsoft 365 service or is still available, but no longer supported. Any functionality that's still available may be removed without notice. If you're still using any of these legacy tools, consider migrating to the eDiscovery tools in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal or one of the alternatives described in this article.

Over the years, Microsoft has provided eDiscovery tools that let you search, preview, and export email content from Exchange Online. However, these tools no longer offer an effective way to search for non-Exchange content in other Microsoft 365 services, such as SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 Groups. To address this, Microsoft offers other eDiscovery tools that help you search for a wide variety of Microsoft 365 content. And we've been working hard to incorporate the most current and powerful eDiscovery functionality in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">compliance portal</a>. This allows organizations to respond to legal, internal, and other document requests for content across many Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online.

As a result of this new and improved eDiscovery functionality in the compliance portal, we're retiring the following eDiscovery-related features and functionality related to searching for email content in Exchange Online and Microsoft 365:

- [In-Place eDiscovery](/exchange/security-and-compliance/in-place-ediscovery/in-place-ediscovery) and [In-Place Holds](/exchange/security-and-compliance/create-or-remove-in-place-holds) in the Exchange admin center.

- The Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets that support In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Holds (these cmdlets are collectively identified as **-MailboxSearch* cmdlets). This includes the following cmdlets:

  - [New-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxsearch)

  - [Start-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/start-mailboxsearch)

  - [Stop-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/stop-mailboxsearch)

  - [Set-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailboxsearch)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The [Get-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailboxsearch) and [Remove-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-mailboxsearch) cmdlets will be available after the other ****-MailboxSearch*** cmdlets are retired so that you can use them to help in your transition to other eDiscovery and hold tools. However, after a certain date (cited below) Microsoft Support will no longer supports these two cmdlets.

- The [Search-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailbox) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell.

- The following operations in the Exchange Web Services API:

   - [GetSearchableMailboxes](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/getsearchablemailboxes-operation)

   - [SearchMailboxes](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/searchmailboxes-operation)
   
   - [SetHoldOnMailboxes](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/setholdonmailboxes-operation)

   - [GetHoldOnMailboxes](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/getholdonmailboxes-operation)

- [Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0](./overview-ediscovery-20.md), which is the first version of eDiscovery (Premium) that's accessed through a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) case in the compliance portal. The retirement of eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0 doesn't impact your ability to create and manage eDiscovery (Standard) cases.

> [!NOTE]
> The eDiscovery functionality being retired only applies to cloud-based versions of Microsoft 365 and Office 365. eDiscovery functionality in on-premises versions of Exchange and SharePoint will still be supported until further notice.

The following sections in this article provide guidance about each feature being retired. This information including timelines and alternative tools that you can use instead of the retired tool.

## In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Holds in the Exchange admin center 

As per the original announcement on July 1, 2017, the In-Place eDiscovery & Hold functionality in the Exchange admin center (EAC) is being retired. The In-Place eDiscovery & Holds page in the EAC allowed you to search, hold, and export content from Exchange Online. In-Place eDiscovery also let you copy search results to a discovery mailbox so that you or other eDiscovery managers could review content and make it available for legal, regulatory, and public requests.

Because all of these capabilities (except for copying search results to a discovery mailbox) are now available in the content search, eDiscovery and eDiscovery (Premium) tools in the [compliance portal](./microsoft-365-compliance-center.md) (with improved functionality, reliability, and support for a wide range of Microsoft 365 services), we recommend that you start using these tools as soon as possible. To help you in the transition to these other eDiscovery tools, the table below lists the tools you can use instead of In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Hold.

### Scope of affected organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Enterprise organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Education organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Government organizations; this includes GCC, GCC High, and DoD

- Office 365 Germany

### Timeline for retirement

- July 1, 2020: You won't be able to create new searches and holds, but you can still run, edit, and delete existing searches at your own risk. Microsoft Support will no longer In-Place eDiscovery & Holds in the EAC.

- October 1, 2020: The In-Place eDiscovery & Holds functionality in the EAC will be placed in a read-only mode. This means you'll only be able to remove existing searches and holds.

### Alternative tools

The following table describes other tools that you can use to replace the existing functionality that's being retired.

### FAQs about In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Holds

**I use the copy search results functionality of In-Place eDiscovery & Holds in the EAC to copy search results to a discovery mailbox for review by attorneys. What options do I have now?**

There are two ways to replicate this functionality today. The first is to use [review sets in eDiscovery (Premium) v2.0](./view-documents-in-review-set.md). Review sets have many of the same capabilities you see in a traditional review tool like fast search of documents, tagging, email threading, near duplicate grouping, themes analysis, and predictive coding. If you still want to use discovery mailboxes for review, the second option is to export search results to PST files and then import the PST files to a discovery mailbox by using the [PST import feature](use-network-upload-to-import-pst-files.md) in the Microsoft compliance center.

**How do I control which content locations (such as mailboxes or sites) that can an eDiscovery manager can search using the new tools?**

The compliance portal also uses [compliance boundaries](set-up-compliance-boundaries.md) to control which content locations an eDiscovery Manager can search. Compliance boundaries are useful in government entities that need to stay within agency boundaries or multi-national corporations required to respect geographical boarders.

**How can I move my current searches and holds to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal?**

It's possible to migrate In-Place eDiscovery searches and holds from the EAC by using PowerShell. For instructions, see [Migrate searches and holds from the EAC to the compliance portal](./migrate-legacy-ediscovery-searches-and-holds.md).

## \*-MailboxSearch cmdlets

As per the original notice announced on July 1, 2017 in the Exchange admin center, the In-Place eDiscovery & Hold functionality and the corresponding **\*-MailboxSearch** cmdlets are being retired. These cmdlets provide users the ability to search, hold, and export mailbox content for legal, regulatory, and public requests.

Because these capabilities are now available in the [<span class="underline">compliance portal</span>](./microsoft-365-compliance-center.md) and Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell with improved performance and scalability, you should using these improved cmdlets. These cmdlets include [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceCase</span>](/powershell/module/exchange/get-compliancecase), [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceSearch</span>](/powershell/module/exchange/get-compliancesearch), [<span class="underline">\*-CaseHoldPolicy</span>](/powershell/module/exchange/get-caseholdpolicy), [<span class="underline">\*-CaseHoldRule</span>](/powershell/module/exchange/get-caseholdrule), and [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceSearchAction</span>](/powershell/module/exchange/get-compliancesearchaction).

### Scope of affected organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Enterprise organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Education organizations

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Government organizations; this includes GCC, GCC High, and DoD

- Office 365 Germany

### Timeline

- July 1, 2020: You won't be able to use **New-MailboxSearch** to create new In-Place eDiscovery searches and In-Place Holds, but you can still use cmdlets to run, edit, and delete existing searches and holds at your own risk. Microsoft Support will no longer provide assistance for these types of searches and holds.

- October 1, 2020: As previously stated, The In-Place eDiscovery & Holds functionality in the EAC will be placed in a read-only mode. That also means that you won't be able to use the **New-MailboxSearch**, **Start-MailboxSearch**, or **Set-MailboxSearch** cmdlets. You'll only be able to get and remove existing searches and holds.

### FAQs about ***-MailboxSearch** cmdlets

**We use Copy Search to export email messages or instant Messages for purposes other eDiscovery and legal investigations. What other options do we have after these cmdlets are retired?**

The [<span class="underline">Microsoft Graph APIs</span>](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) provide a number of methods for extracting data for analysis and other purposes that are far more resilient and scalable than the using the **\*-MailboxSearch** cmdlets.

**How can I migrate my searches and holds to the compliance portal?**

It's possible to migrate In-Place eDiscovery searches and holds from the Exchange admin center by using a PowerShell script. For more information, see [Migrate legacy eDiscovery searches and holds to the compliance portal](migrate-legacy-eDiscovery-searches-and-holds.md).

**After the cmdlets are retired, will I still be able to remove or retrieve searches?**

Yes, although we're removing the ability to create and modify searches, you'll still be able to use **Get-MailboxSearch** and **Remove-MailboxSearch** until further notice. However, the use of these cmdlets will be at your own risk after the retirement dates and Microsoft Support will no longer be able to provide assistance.

## Search-Mailbox cmdlet

The **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell is being retired as originally announced in a warning in the cmdlet output starting back in 2018. The **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet was originally used to search a user's mailbox and purge malicious content. We recommend that you start using the **New-ComplianceSearch** and **New-ComplianceSearchAction** cmdlets in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell to search for and purge content. For a built-in security experience, the [<span class="underline">Microsoft 365 security features</span>](../security/index.yml) provide robust threat protection for email and many other Microsoft services.

### Scope of affected organizations

## eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0

eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0, which is the version of eDiscovery (Premium) available in a eDiscovery (Standard) case by clicking **Switch to eDiscovery (Premium)**, is being retired. Its functionality has been replaced by the new [eDiscovery (Premium) solution](./ediscovery.md) in the compliance portal.

To determine if your organization is using eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0:

1. Go to the compliance portal, select **eDiscovery** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2174007" target="_blank">**Core**</a>, and open a eDiscovery (Standard) case.

1. If you see the **Switch to eDiscovery (Premium)** button, then clicking it will take you to the 1.0 version of eDiscovery (Premium), which is being retired. The ability to create and manage cases in eDiscovery (Standard) won't be affected. Only the ability to add and analyze case data in eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0 (by clicking **Switch to eDiscovery (Premium)**) is being retired.

The new eDiscovery (Premium) solution in Microsoft 365 (also known as *eDiscovery (Premium) v2.0*) provides all of the capabilities of the original solution, but now includes a custodian-based approach of identifying content in other Microsoft 365 services, collecting that content, and then adding it to a review set where reviewers can take advantage of fast search queries, tagging, and analytics features to help cull relevant documents. eDiscovery (Premium) now includes improved processing and native viewers for both Microsoft and non-Microsoft file types, a full list of file types is [here](./supported-filetypes-ediscovery20.md) and supported metadata fields are [here](./document-metadata-fields-in-advanced-ediscovery.md). Also, the new eDiscovery (Premium) solution provides a powerful custodian holds management feature that lets you apply holds to content in different services, notify users of the holds, and track custodian responses, all within an eDiscovery (Premium) case.

To access eDiscovery (Premium) v2.0:

Go to the compliance portal, select **eDiscovery** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2174006" target="_blank">**Advanced**</a>, and open a eDiscovery (Standard) case.

At this time, we recommend that you begin to transition your eDiscovery workflow to the new eDiscovery (Premium) functionality. If necessary, you can archive your eDiscovery (Premium) 1.0 cases by exporting the content and storing it offline. Although you'll still be able to access eDiscovery (Premium) v1.0 in existing cases until December 31, 2020, Microsoft Support won't provide support after October 1, 2020. See the following timeline for more details.
