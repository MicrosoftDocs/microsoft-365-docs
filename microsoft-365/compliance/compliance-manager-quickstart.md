## First visit: get to know Compliance Manager

Compliance Manager is located in the Microsoft 365 compliance center at https://compliance.microsoft.com.

The first time you visit Compliance Manager, you'll see a compliance score for your organization. Compliance Manager is already assessing your current Microsoft 365 environment against the data protection baseline.
