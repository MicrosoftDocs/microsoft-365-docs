# Create custom sensitive information types with Exact Data Match based classification

## Overview

[Custom sensitive information types](custom-sensitive-info-types.md) are used to help prevent inadvertent or inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. As an administrator, you can use the [Security & Compliance Center](create-a-custom-sensitive-information-type.md) or [PowerShell](create-a-custom-sensitive-information-type-in-scc-powershell.md) to define a custom sensitive information type based on patterns, evidence (keywords such as *employee*, *badge*, *ID*, and so on), character proximity (how close evidence is to characters in a particular pattern), and confidence levels. Such custom sensitive information types meet business needs for many organizations.

But what if you wanted a custom sensitive information type that uses exact data values, instead of matching only with generic patterns? With Exact Data Match (EDM)-based classification, you can create a custom sensitive information type that is designed to:

- be dynamic and refreshable;
- be more scalable;
- result in fewer false-positives;
- work with structured sensitive data;
- handle sensitive information more securely; and
- be used with several Microsoft cloud services.

![EDM-based classification](media/EDMClassification.png)

EDM-based classification enables you to create custom sensitive information types that refer to exact values in a database of sensitive information. The database can be refreshed daily or weekly, and it can contain up to 10 million rows of data. So as employees, patients, or clients come and go, and records change, your custom sensitive information types remain current and applicable. And, you can use EDM-based classification with policies, such as [data loss prevention policies](data-loss-prevention-policies.md) (DLP) or [Microsoft Cloud App Security file policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/data-protection-policies).

## Required licenses and permissions

You must be a global admin, compliance administrator, or Exchange Online administrator to perform the tasks described in this article. To learn more about DLP permissions, see [Permissions](data-loss-prevention-policies.md#permissions).

When generally available, EDM-based classification will be included in these subscriptions

- Office 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 Information Protection and Compliance
- Office 365 Advanced Compliance

### Part 1: Set up EDM-based classification

Setting up and configuring EDM-based classification involves saving sensitive data in .csv format, defining a schema for your database of sensitive information, creating a rule package, and then uploading the schema and rule package.

#### Define the schema for your database of sensitive information

1. Identify the sensitive information you want to use. Export the data to an app, such as Microsoft Excel, and save the file in .csv format. The data file can include a maximum of:
      - Up to 10 million rows of sensitive data
      - Up to 32 columns (fields) per data source
      - Up to 5 columns (fields) marked as searchable

2. Structure the sensitive data in the .csv file such that the first row includes the names of the fields used for EDM-based classification. In your .csv file, you might have field names, such as "ssn", "birthdate", "firstname", "lastname", and so on. As an example, our .csv file is called *PatientRecords.csv*, and its columns include *PatientID*, *MRN*, *LastName*, *FirstName*, *SSN* and more.

3. Define the schema for the database of sensitive information in .xml format (similar to our example below). Name this schema file edm.xml, and configure it such that for each column in the database, there is a line that uses the syntax \<Field name="" searchable=""/\>.

      - Use column names for *Field name* values.
      - Use *searchable="true"* for the fields that you want to be searchable up to a maximum of 5 fields. You must designate a minimum of one field as searchable.

As an example, the following .xml file defines the schema for a patient records database, with five fields specified as searchable: *PatientID*, *MRN*, *SSN*, *Phone*, and *DOB*.

(You can copy, modify, and use our example.)

 ```xml
<EdmSchema xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2018/edm">
      <DataStore name="PatientRecords" description="Schema for patient records" version="1">
            <Field name="PatientID" searchable="true" />
            <Field name="MRN" searchable="true" />
            <Field name="FirstName" />
            <Field name="LastName" />
            <Field name="SSN" searchable="true" />
            <Field name="Phone" searchable="true" />
            <Field name="DOB" searchable="true" />
            <Field name="Gender" />
            <Field name="Address" />
      </DataStore>
</EdmSchema>
```

4. [Connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

5. To upload the database schema, run the following cmdlets, one at a time:

```powershell
$edmSchemaXml=Get-Content .\\edm.xml -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0
New-DlpEdmSchema -FileData $edmSchemaXml -Confirm:$true
```

You will be prompted to confirm, as follows:

> Confirm
>
> Are you sure you want to perform this action?
>
> New EDM Schema for the data store 'patientrecords' will be imported.
>
> \[Y\] Yes \[A\] Yes to All \[N\] No \[L\] No to All \[?\] Help (default is "Y"):

> [!TIP]
> If you want your changes to occur without confirmation, in Step 5, use this cmdlet instead: New-DlpEdmSchema -FileData $edmSchemaXml

> [!NOTE]
> It can take between 10-60 minutes to update the EDMSchema with additions. The update must complete before you execute steps that use the additions.

Now that the schema for your database of sensitive information is defined, the next step is to set up a rule package. Proceed to the section [Set up a rule package](#set-up-a-rule-package).

#### Editing the schema for EDM-based classification

If you want to make changes to your edm.xml file, such as changing which fields are used for EDM-based classification, follow these steps:

1. Edit your edm.xml file (this is the file discussed in the [Define the schema](#define-the-schema-for-your-database-of-sensitive-information) section of this article).

2. [Connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

3. To update your database schema, run the following cmdlets, one at a time:

```powershell
$edmSchemaXml=Get-Content .\\edm.xml -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0
Set-DlpEdmSchema -FileData $edmSchemaXml -Confirm:$true
```

You will be prompted to confirm, as follows:

> Confirm
>
> Are you sure you want to perform this action?
>
> EDM Schema for the data store 'patientrecords' will be updated.
>
> \[Y\] Yes \[A\] Yes to All \[N\] No \[L\] No to All \[?\] Help (default is "Y"):

> [!TIP]
> If you want your changes to occur without confirmation, in Step 3, use this cmdlet instead: Set-DlpEdmSchema -FileData $edmSchemaXml

> [!NOTE]
> It can take between 10-60 minutes to update the EDMSchema with additions. The update must complete before you execute steps that use the additions.

## Removing the schema for EDM-based classification

(As needed) If you want to remove the schema you're using for EDM-based classification, follow these steps:

1. [Connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

2. Run the following PowerShell cmdlets, substituting the data store name of "patientrecords" with the one you want to remove:

```powershell
Remove-DlpEdmSchema -Identity patientrecords
```

You will be prompted to confirm, as follows:

> Confirm
>
> Are you sure you want to perform this action?
>
> EDM Schema for the data store 'patientrecords' will be removed.
>
> \[Y\] Yes \[A\] Yes to All \[N\] No \[L\] No to All \[?\] Help (default is "Y"):

> [!TIP]
>  If you want your changes to occur without confirmation, in Step 2, use this cmdlet instead: Remove-DlpEdmSchema -Identity patientrecords -Confirm:$false

### Set up a rule package

1. Create a rule package in .xml format (with Unicode encoding), similar to the following example. (You can copy, modify, and use our example.)

When you set up your rule package, make sure to correctly reference your .csv file and edm.xml file. You can copy, modify, and use our example. In this sample xml the following fields needs to be customized to create your EDM sensitive type:

- **RulePack id & ExactMatch id**: Use [New-GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-guid?view=powershell-6) to generate a GUID.

- **Datastore**: This field specifies EDM lookup data store to be used. You provide a data source name of a configured EDM Schema.

- **idMatch**: This field points to the primary element for EDM.
  - Matches: Specifies the field to be used in exact lookup. You provide a searchable field name in EDM Schema for the DataStore.
  - Classification: This field specifies the sensitive type match that triggers EDM lookup. You can provide Name or GUID of an existing built-in or custom classification.

- **Match:** This field points to additional evidence found in proximity of idMatch.
  - Matches: You provide any field name in EDM Schema for DataStore.
- **Resource:** This section specifies the name and description for sensitive type in multiple locales.
  - idRef: You provide GUID for ExactMatch id.
  - Name & des Editing the schema criptions: customize as required.

```xml
<RulePackage xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2018/edm">

    </Details>
  </RulePack>
  <Rules>
    <ExactMatch id = "E1CC861E-3FE9-4A58-82DF-4BD259EAB371" patternsProximity = "300" dataStore ="PatientRecords" recommendedConfidence = "65" >
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="65">
        <idMatch matches = "SSN" classification = "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)" />
      </Pattern>
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="75">
        <idMatch matches = "SSN" classification = "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)" />
        <Any minMatches ="3" maxMatches ="100">
          <match matches="PatientID" />
          <match matches="MRN"/>
          <match matches="FirstName"/>
          <match matches="LastName"/>
          <match matches="Phone"/>
          <match matches="DOB"/>
        </Any>
      </Pattern>
    </ExactMatch>
    <LocalizedStrings>
      <Resource idRef="E1CC861E-3FE9-4A58-82DF-4BD259EAB371">
        <Name default="true" langcode="en-us">Patient SSN Exact Match.</Name>
        <Description default="true" langcode="en-us">EDM Sensitive type for detecting Patient SSN.</Description>
      </Resource>
    </LocalizedStrings>
  </Rules>
</RulePackage>
```

1. Upload the rule package by running the following PowerShell cmdlets, one at a time:

```powershell
$rulepack=Get-Content .\\rulepack.xml -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0
New-DlpSensitiveInformationTypeRulePackage -FileData $rulepack
```

At this point, you have set up EDM-based classification. The next step is to index the sensitive data, and then upload the indexed data.

Recall from the previous procedure that our PatientRecords schema defines five fields as searchable: *PatientID*, *MRN*, *SSN*, *Phone*, and *DOB*. Our example rule package includes those fields and references the database schema file (edm.xml), with one *ExactMatch* items per searchable field. Consider the following ExactMatch item:

```xml
<ExactMatch id = "E1CC861E-3FE9-4A58-82DF-4BD259EAB371" patternsProximity = "300" dataStore ="PatientRecords" recommendedConfidence = "65" >
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="65">
        <idMatch matches = "SSN" classification = "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)" />
      </Pattern>
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="75">
        <idMatch matches = "SSN" classification = "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)" />
        <Any minMatches ="3" maxMatches ="100">
          <match matches="PatientID" />
          <match matches="MRN"/>
          <match matches="FirstName"/>
          <match matches="LastName"/>
          <match matches="Phone"/>
          <match matches="DOB"/>
        </Any>
      </Pattern>
    </ExactMatch>
```

In this example, note the following:

- The dataStore name references the .csv file we created earlier: **dataStore = "PatientRecords"**.

- The idMatch value references a searchable field that is listed in the database schema file: **idMatch matches = "SSN"**.

- The classification value references an existing or custom sensitive information type: **classification = "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)"**. (In this case, we use the existing sensitive information type of U.S. Social Security Number.)

> [!NOTE]
> It can take between 10-60 minutes to update the EDMSchema with additions. The update must complete before you execute steps that use the additions.

### Part 2: Index and upload the sensitive data

During this phase, you set up a custom security group and user account, and set up the EDM Upload Agent tool. Then, you use the tool to index the sensitive data, and upload the indexed data.

#### Set up the security group and user account

1. As a global administrator, go to the admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/)) and [create a security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group?view=o365-worldwide) called EDM\_DataUploaders.

2. Add one or more users to the *EDM\_DataUploaders* security group. (These users will manage the database of sensitive information.)

3. Make sure each user who is managing the sensitive data is a local admin on the machine used for the EDM Upload Agent.

#### Set up the EDM Upload Agent

>[!NOTE]
> Before you begin this procedure, make sure that you are a member of the *EDM\_DataUploaders* security group and a local admin on your machine.

1. Download and install the [EDM Upload Agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088639). By default, the installation location should be C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\EdmUploadAgent.

2. To authorize the EDM Upload Agent, open Windows Command Prompt (as an administrator), and then run the following command:

    `EdmUploadAgent.exe /Authorize`

3. Sign in with your work or school account for Office 365.

The next step is to use the EDM Upload Agent to index the sensitive data, and then upload the indexed data.

#### Index and upload the sensitive data

Save the sensitive data file (recall our example is *PatientRecords.csv*) to the local drive on the machine. (We saved our example *PatientRecords.csv* file to C:\\Edm\\Data.)

To index and upload the sensitive data, run the following command in Windows Command Prompt:

`EdmUploadAgent.exe /UploadData /DataStoreName \<DataStoreName\> /DataFile \<DataFilePath\> /HashLocation \<HashedFileLocation\>`

Example: **EdmUploadAgent.exe /UploadData /DataStoreName PatientRecords /DataFile C:\\Edm\\Hash\\PatientRecords.csv /HashLocation C:\\Edm\\Hash**

To separate and execute index of sensitive data in an isolated environment, execute index and upload steps separately.

To index the sensitive data, run the following command in Windows Command Prompt:

`EdmUploadAgent.exe /CreateHash /DataFile \<DataFilePath\> /HashLocation \<HashedFileLocation\>`

Example: **EdmUploadAgent.exe /CreateHash /DataFile C:\\Edm\\Data\\PatientRecords.csv /HashLocation C:\\Edm\\Hash**

To upload the indexed data, run the following command in Windows Command Prompt:

`EdmUploadAgent.exe /UploadHash /DataStoreName \<DataStoreName\> /HashFile \<HashedSourceFilePath\>`

Example: **EdmUploadAgent.exe /UploadHash /DataStoreName PatientRecords /HashFile C:\\Edm\\Hash\\PatientRecords.EdmHash**

To verify your sensitive data has been uploaded, run the following command in Windows Command Prompt:

`EdmUploadAgent.exe /GetDataStore`

You'll see a list of data stores and when they were last updated.

Proceed to set up your process and schedule for [Refreshing your sensitive information database](#refreshing-your-sensitive-information-database).

At this point, you are ready to use EDM-based classification with your Microsoft cloud services. For example, you can [set up a DLP policy using EDM-based classification](#to-create-a-dlp-policy-with-edm).

#### Refreshing your sensitive information database

You can refresh your sensitive information database daily or weekly, and the EDM Upload Tool can reindex the sensitive data and then reupload the indexed data.

1. Determine your process and frequency (daily or weekly) for refreshing the database of sensitive information.

2. Re-export the sensitive data to an app, such as Microsoft Excel, and save the file in .csv format. Keep the same file name and location you used when you followed the steps described in [Index and upload the sensitive data](#index-and-upload-the-sensitive-data).

> [!NOTE]
> If there are no changes to the structure (field names) of the .csv file, you won't need to make any changes to your database schema file when you refresh the data. But if you must make changes, make sure to edit the database schema and your rule package accordingly.

3. Use [Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/TaskSchd/task-scheduler-start-page) to automate steps 2 and 3 in the [Index and upload the sensitive data](#index-and-upload-the-sensitive-data) procedure. You can schedule tasks using several methods:

| **Method**             | **What to do**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### Example PowerShell script for Task Scheduler

This section includes an example PowerShell script you can use to schedule your tasks for indexing data and uploading the indexed data:

##### To schedule index and upload in a combined step

```powershell

### Part 3: Use EDM-based classification with your Microsoft cloud services

Office 365 DLP for Exchange Online (email), OneDrive for Business (files), Microsoft Teams (conversations) and Microsoft Cloud App Security DLP policies will support EDM sensitive information types.

EDM sensitive information types for following scenarios are currently in development, but not yet available:

- Office 365 DLP for SharePoint (files)
- Auto-classification of sensitivity labels and retention labels

#### To create a DLP policy with EDM
