# Data Subject Requests for the GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives rights to people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined very broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of it, requesting changes to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is called a Data Subject Request or DSR. The controller is obligated to promptly consider each DSR and provide a substantive response either by taking the requested action or by providing an explanation for why the DSR cannot be accommodated by the controller. A controller should consult with its own legal or compliance advisers regarding the proper disposition of any given DSR.

These articles discusses how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to help you find and act on personal data to respond to DSRs:

- [Office 365](gdpr-dsr-Office365.md)
- [Windows](gdpr-dsr-Windows.md)
- [Azure](gdpr-dsr-Azure.md)
- [Intune](gdpr-dsr-Intune.md)
- [Dynamics 365](gdpr-dsr-Dynamics365.md)
- [Visual Studio Family](gdpr-dsr-visual-studio-family.md)
- [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](gdpr-dsr-vsts.md)
- [Microsoft Support and Professional Services](gdpr-dsr-prof-services.md)

For more information about how Microsoft enables you to respond to DSRs, see [GDPR: Data Subject Requests (DSRs)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRDSR) in the Service Trust Portal.
