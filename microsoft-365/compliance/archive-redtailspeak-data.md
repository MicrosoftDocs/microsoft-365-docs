# Set up a connector to archive Redtail Speak data

Use a Globanet connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive data from the Redtail Speak to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Globanet provides you with a [Redtail Speak](https://globanet.com/redtail/) connector that's configured to capture items from your organization’s SFTP server where the items are received from Redtail. The connector converts the content from Redtail Speak to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After Redtail Speak data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies, and retention labels. Using a Redtail Speak connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving the Redtail Speak data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive the Redtail Speak data in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for Redtail Speak data](../media/RedtailSpeakConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with Redtail Speak to set up and configure an SMTP gateway where messages are forwarded from Redtail Speak to your organization's SFTP server on a daily basis.

2. Once every 24 hours, the Redtail Speak items are copied to the Globanet Merge1 site. The connector also converts the Redtail Speak items to an email message format.

3. The Redtail Speak connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center connects to the Globanet Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted Redtail Speak items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in [Step 3](#step-3-map-users-and-complete-the-connector-setup). A subfolder in the Inbox folder named **Redtail Speak** is created in the user mailboxes, and the items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every Redtail Speak item contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant of the item.

## Before you begin

- Create a Globanet Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create an account, contact [Globanet Customer Support](https://globanet.com/contact-us/). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- In Step 2, you need to specify your organization's SFTP server. This step is necessary so that Globanet Merge1 can contact it to collect Redtail Speak data via SFTP.

- The user who creates the Redtail Speak Importer connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the Data connectors page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. This role is not assigned to any role group in Exchange Online by default. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the Redtail Speak connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and create a connector for the Redtail Speak data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and select **Data connectors** &gt; **Redtail Speak**.

2. On the **Redtail Speak** product description page, select **Add new connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, select **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then select **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the Redtail Speak connector on the Globanet Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the Redtail Speak connector on the Merge1 site. For information about how to configure the Redtail Speak connector, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Redtail%20Speak%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you select **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map Redtail Speak users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The Redtail Speak items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that user’s mailbox.

2. Select **Next**, review your settings, and go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the Redtail Speak connector

After you create the Redtail Speak connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and select **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Select the **Connectors** tab and then select the **Redtail Speak** connector to display the flyout page. This page displays properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, select the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
