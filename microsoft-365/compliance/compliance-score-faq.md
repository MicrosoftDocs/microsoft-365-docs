# Microsoft Compliance Score (Preview) frequently asked questions

## What is Compliance Score?

Microsoft Compliance Score is a preview feature in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](microsoft-365-compliance-center.md) that helps you understand your organization’s compliance posture. It calculates a risk-based score measuring your progress in completing actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It also provides built-in control mapping that helps connect common controls among key regulations and standards, so you can take one action to satisfy multiple requirements at the same time and better scale your compliance program.

## How do I access Compliance Score?

Go to the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and **sign in** with a Microsoft 365 global admin, compliance admin, or compliance data admin role. Select **Compliance Score** on the left navigation pane. You should then see your [Compliance Score dashboard with your score](compliance-score-setup.md#understand-the-compliance-score-dashboard). If you don’t have appropriate role access, the global admin for your organization can grant you permission.

## What roles or permissions are needed to use Compliance Score?

Compliance Score uses a role-based access control (RBAC) permission model, and the actions you can perform depend on the type of role assigned to you. Your organization's Microsoft 365 global admin is the person who can perform the setup functions and administer roles in Compliance Score. At a minimum, users need the **Azure AD global reader** role to read data in Compliance Score. Learn more about permissions, roles, and setup procedures at [Compliance Score setup](compliance-score-setup.md).

## What is the difference between Compliance Score and Compliance Manager?

Compliance Score and Compliance Manager share the same backend, but they are in two different locations (Compliance Score is in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and Compliance Manager is in the Microsoft Service Trust Portal). Think of Compliance Score as a simplified version of Compliance Manager, giving you a more complete view of your organization's current compliance posture and the steps you can take to improve it. While you can take many actions directly within Compliance Score, some functionality resides in Compliance Manager for now. Read more about the [relationship between Compliance Score and Compliance Manager](compliance-score.md#relationship-to-compliance-manager).

## Who should use Compliance Score and who should use Compliance Manager?

Compliance Score is useful for everyone in your organization who plays a role in monitoring compliance and carrying out activities to help comply with regulatory standards. With Compliance Score, you don't need to be familiar with regulations and standards to help improve your organization's data protection. Compliance Score is the optimal starting place for all users. From here, you can see your compliance score, learn which recommended actions can help minimize risks, and, in many cases, launch right into the solutions to take those actions.

For now, Compliance Manager is the place where users can manage assessments and create custom templates to build assessments. Learn more about [which actions are supported only by Compliance Manager](compliance-score-release-notes.md#compliance-score-and-compliance-manager-relationship) during public preview.

## If I have a high score, does it mean I'm fully compliant?

No. Your compliance score measures your progress in completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It does not express an absolute measure of organizational compliance with any particular standard or regulation. Compliance Score should not be interpreted as a guarantee in any way.

## What regulations and standards does Compliance Score monitor?

Compliance Score gives you an initial score based on the Microsoft 365 data protection baseline, which is a set of controls that includes common industry regulations and standards. This baseline draws elements primarily from NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization), as well as from FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union).

Organizations can create and add custom assessments that are more relevant to their organization. You can use one of Compliance Score's [out-of-the-box templates](compliance-score.md#templates) to create assessments for particular standards, or [create your own template](working-with-compliance-manager.md#create-a-template-1).

Read more about [how Compliance Score calculates your score](compliance-score-methodology.md).

## What is the difference between Compliance Score and Secure Score?

Compliance Score provides a broad view of your organization's data protection and compliance posture. Compliance Score also provides built-in workflow tools; it lets organizations assign work to users, track the control implementation and test status, and upload evidence and create audit reports.

Microsoft Secure Score is a security analytics tool for helping to understand your security posture. [Learn more about Secure Score and how it works](../security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score.md).

## Which cloud services are covered by Compliance Score?

Compliance Score currently provides assessments for Office 365 and Intune. Expanded coverage is expected in future releases, and will be noted in the [Compliance Score release notes](compliance-score-release-notes.md).

## Can I use Compliance Score for non-Microsoft products?

While Compliance Score provides continuous monitoring and recommended actions only for Microsoft cloud services, you can add custom assessments in Compliance Manager for your on-premises, third-party services. In this way, you can use Microsoft Compliance Score as a SaaS compliance management tool to help you manage all the controls across your digital assets.

You can use one of Compliance Score's [out-of-the-box templates](compliance-score.md#templates) to create assessments for particular standards, or [create your own template](working-with-compliance-manager.md#create-a-template-1).

## How do I delete a template or assessment I no longer need?

You can't delete an assessment or template, but you can hide them from your view. Review [instructions for hiding assessments](working-with-compliance-manager.md#hide-a-template-or-an-assessment).
