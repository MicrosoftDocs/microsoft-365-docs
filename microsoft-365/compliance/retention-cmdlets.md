# PowerShell cmdlets for retention policies and retention labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

Use the following sections to identify the main PowerShell cmdlets that are available for retention policies and retention labels that you might need for configuration at-scale, automated scripts, or advanced configuration scenarios. For the full list of  cmdlets, see the [policy-and-compliance-retention list](/powershell/module/exchange#policy-and-compliance-retention) from the PowerShell documentation.

Before you use these cmdlets, you must first [connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

In the descriptions that follow, a policy for retention can refer to a retention policy (no labels), or a retention label policy. Each policy defines whether it's static or adaptive and the locations for the policy to be applied. 

When you use retention policies, the policy requires one rule to complete the configuration, for example, a rule that defines the retention settings, such as retain for five years and then delete.

When you use retention labels, these contain the retention settings and their policies need different rules:
- A retention label policy that you publish needs a rule that defines which labels should be displayed in apps.
- An auto-apply retention label policy needs a rule that defines the label to apply and the conditions for applying the label.

## Retention cmdlets for most locations

Use the cmdlets in the following table when the locations are **Exchange mailboxes**, **SharePoint sites** or **SharePoint classic and communication sites**, **OneDrive accounts**, **Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes & sites**, **Skype for Business**, **Exchange public folders**, **Teams chat messages**, or **Teams channel messages**.

Don't use these cmdlets when the locations are for Teams private channel messages, Yammer user messages, or Yammer community messages. These locations have alternative cmdlets that are identified in the [next section](#retention-cmdlets-specific-to-teams-private-channels-and-yammer).
