# Compliance offering: European Standards EN 301 549 reports

## About EN 301 549

Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of information and communications technologies (ICT) products and services are set forth in EN 301 549, which is a set of standards for ICT products and services including websites, software, and digital devices. EN 301 549 was published in 2014 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to a request from the European Commission, and it was updated in 2018 with version 2.1.2. It is intended for use in procurement by government and public-sector organizations. EN 301 549 incorporates the WCAG 2.1 standards for web accessibility in clause 9.2.

Because Microsoft is a major software and cloud-services provider to European states, it is committed to complying with all relevant [government standards and compliance controls](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2051708). By adhering to these wide-ranging accessibility standards, Microsoft ensures that all customers — both inside and outside of government — can use Microsoft services and products.

## Microsoft and EN 301 549

Microsoft’s adherence to the EN 301 549 standard points to its commitment to accessibility for all customers. EN 301 549 is the Europe-specific accessibility standard that complements Section 508 (U.S.) and WCAG 2.1 (international).
