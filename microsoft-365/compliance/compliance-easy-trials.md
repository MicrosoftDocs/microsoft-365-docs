# About the Microsoft Purview solutions trial

Microsoft Purview solutions help protect your organization from internal threats arising from inappropriate permissions on files and emails, and helps your organization to comply with regulatory and internal business requirements.

The Microsoft Purview solutions trial is the easiest way to try all the capabilities of Microsoft Purview solutions, and setting it up only takes a couple of minutes. After the trial setup is complete, all features of the Microsoft E5 license package are available for you to use for up to 90 days.

Get more details about [roles for starting Microsoft 365 trials](compliance-easy-trials-roles.md).

## How to sign up for the trial

Visit the [Microsoft 365 trials hub](https://compliance.microsoft.com/trialHorizontalHub?sku=ComplianceE5&ref=DocsRef) to sign up for the trial. You can also follow the steps below:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149), select **Trials** on the left navigation to get to the Microsoft 365 trials hub.
2. Under **Compliance trials**, find the **Microsoft Purview solutions** card and select **Try now**.
3. On the **Microsoft Purview solutions trial** flyout pane, review the information about what's included and what to expect when you start the trial, then select **Start trial.**

Your trial will be effective immediately for 90 days. It can take up to two hours for all Purview solutions to appear in your left navigation. Sign out and sign back in to see the updates.

## Getting started, finding support, and ending the trial

#### Getting started

You can start using Purview solutions as soon as you see them in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Nothing is created automatically and users won't be affected. When you navigate to each solution, you may be guided to make extra setup configurations to start using features.

Use our [trial playbook](compliance-easy-trials-compliance-playbook.md) to help you get started.

#### Finding support

Organizations may use FastTrack for trial deployment support if the tenant has at least 150 licenses. Get more [details about FastTrack](/fasttrack/introduction).

#### Extending the trial

You can extend the trial within the last 15 days of the trial period. You're limited to a maximum of two trial periods. If you don't extend by the time your trial period ends, you'll need to wait at least 30 days before signing up for a second trial.

#### Ending the trial

Admins can disable the trial anytime by going to the **Purview solutions trial** card in the Microsoft 365 trials hub (see [How to sign up for the trial](#how-to-sign-up-for-the-trial)) and selecting **End trial**.

If you decide not to upgrade to the E5 level solutions, unless stated otherwise for the solution your trial data will be maintained for a period of time, usually 180 days, before being permanently deleted. You may continue to access the data gathered during the trial until that time.

- **Audit**

  Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) helps organizations to conduct forensic and compliance investigations by increasing audit log retention required to conduct an investigation, providing access to crucial events that help determine scope of compromise, and faster access to Office 365 Management Activity API.

Learn more about [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md)

- **Data Lifecycle Management**

  Automate your retention coverage by using adaptive policy scopes. This feature allows you to dynamically target policies for retention to specific users, groups, or sites. These policies automatically update when changes occur in your organization. In addition, policies that use adaptive scopes are not subject to location limits. Learn more about [adaptive policy scopes](retention.md#adaptive-or-static-policy-scopes-for-retention).

- **Data Loss Prevention**

  Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) helps you control sharing and use of sensitive info on devices, apps, and services. With trials, you can extend coverage of DLP policies to Teams and devices, protect even more sensitive content using trainable classifiers and exact data match (EDM), and get started quickly with our recommended DLP policies.  [Learn more about Data Loss Prevention](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md)

   When the trial ends:

  - Your existing policies will stay turned on unless you turn them off.
  - You'll no longer be able to edit or add Teams or Devices locations in existing or new policies.

- **eDiscovery**

  Take advantage of an end-to-end workflow for preserving, collecting, analyzing, and exporting content that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. Legal teams can also manage the entire legal hold notification process by communicating with custodians involved in a case. Learn more about [eDiscovery](ediscovery.md)

- **Information Protection**

  Implement Microsoft Purview Information Protection with [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) to help you discover, classify, and protect your sensitive content wherever it lives or travels. With the trials, you can recommend users apply sensitivity labels to their emails and docs, discover and automatically label sensitive content, take advantage of machine learning based classifiers, and get started quickly with our recommended labels and policies.

  The Information Protection trial provides you with default labels, auto-labeling for documents and emails, and data loss prevention to protect credit card numbers shared in Teams and by devices. The default policies we create for you get you up and running quickly, but you can fully customize them as you want.

    When the trial ends:

  - All files and emails labeled during your trial stay labeled. You can manually remove the labels.
  - Your existing policies will stay turned on unless you turn them off.
  - Any auto-labeling policies cannot be edited after the trial ends, but can be deleted.
