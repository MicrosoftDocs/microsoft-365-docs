## How to sign up for the trial

Visit the [Microsoft 365 trials hub](https://compliance.microsoft.com/trialHorizontalHub?sku=ComplianceE5&ref=DocsRef) to sign up for the trial. You can also follow the steps below:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149), select **Trials** on the left navigation to get to the Microsoft 365 trials hub.
2. Under **Compliance trials**, find the **Microsoft Purview solutions** card and select **Try now**.
3. On the **Microsoft Purview solutions trial** flyout pane, review the information about what's included and what to expect when you start the trial, then select **Start trial.**

Your trial will be effective immediately for 90 days. It can take up to two hours for all Purview solutions to appear in your left navigation. Sign out and sign back in to see the updates.

## Getting started, finding support, and ending the trial

#### Getting started

You can start using Purview solutions as soon as you see them in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Nothing is created automatically and users won't be affected. When you navigate to each solution, you may be guided to make extra setup configurations to start using features.

Use our [trial user guide](compliance-easy-trials-compliance-playbook.md) to help you get started.

#### Finding support

Organizations may use FastTrack for trial deployment support if the tenant has at least 150 licenses. Get more [details about FastTrack](/fasttrack/introduction).

#### Extending the trial

You can extend the trial within the last 15 days of the trial period. You're limited to a maximum of two trial periods. If you don't extend by the time your trial period ends, you'll need to wait at least 30 days before signing up for a second trial.

#### Ending the trial

Admins can disable the trial anytime by going to the **Purview solutions trial** card in the Microsoft 365 trials hub (see [How to sign up for the trial](#how-to-sign-up-for-the-trial)) and selecting **End trial**.

If you decide not to upgrade to the E5 level solutions, unless stated otherwise for the solution your trial data will be maintained for a period of time, usually 180 days, before being permanently deleted. You may continue to access the data gathered during the trial until that time.

  The Information Protection trial provides you with default labels, auto-labeling for documents and emails, and data loss prevention to protect credit card numbers shared in Teams and by devices. The default policies we create for you get you up and running quickly, but you can fully customize them as you want.

  - All files and emails labeled during your trial stay labeled. You can manually remove the labels.
  - Your existing policies will stay turned on unless you turn them off.
  - Any auto-labeling policies can't be edited after the trial ends, but can be deleted.
