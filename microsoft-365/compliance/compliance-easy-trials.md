# About the Microsoft Purview solutions trial

[!include[Purview banner](../includes/purview-rebrand-banner.md)]

Microsoft Purview solutions help protect your organization from internal threats rising from inappropriate permissions on files and emails, and helps your organization to comply with regulatory and policy requirements.

The Microsoft Purview solutions trial is the easiest way to try all the capabilities of Microsoft Purview solutions, and setting it up only takes a couple of minutes. After the trial setup is complete, all features of the Microsoft E5 license package are available for you to use for up to 90 days.

## Terms and conditions

See the [terms and conditions](terms-conditions.md) for Microsoft Purview trials.

## Set up a compliance trial

You can sign up for a trial in the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149) using the **Trials** link in the left navigation pane.

## Licensing

As part of the trial setup, the Microsoft E5 compliance licenses are automatically applied to your organization. The licenses are active for 90 days.

## Permissions

To start or end the trial, you need to be a member of the Global Administrator or Security Administrator roles in Azure Active Directory. For details, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Additional information

After you enroll in the trial, it might take up to 2 hours for the changes and updates to be available. And, admins must sign out and sign back in to see the changes.

You can extend the trial within the last 15 days of the trial period. You are limited to a maximum of two trial periods. If you do not extend by the time your trial period ends, you must wait at least 30 days before signing up for a second trial.

## Ending the trial

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the compliance card.

If you decide not to enroll in a feature that is part of the compliance solutions trial, unless stated otherwise for the solution, your trial data will be maintained for a period of time, usually 180 days, before being permanently deleted. You may continue to access the data gathered during the trial until that time.

## Availability

The Microsoft Purview solutions trial is gradually rolling out to existing customers who meet specific criteria (including geography) who don't already have a Microsoft E5 license package.

## Learn more about compliance solutions

Wondering what you can experience in your free trial? The compliance solutions trial includes the following solutions:

- **Audit**

  Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) helps organizations to conduct forensic and compliance investigations by increasing audit log retention required to conduct an investigation, providing access to crucial events that help determine scope of compromise, and faster access to Office 365 Management Activity API. Learn more about [Audit](advanced-audit.md)

- **Communication Compliance**

  Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance helps you overcome modern compliance challenges associated with internal and external communications by helping you automatically capture inappropriate messages, investigate possible policy violations, and take steps to remediate. Learn more about [Communication Compliance](communication-compliance.md)

- **Compliance Manager**

  Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager can help you throughout your compliance journey, from taking inventory of your data protection risks to managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications, and reporting to auditors. Learn more about [Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md)

- **eDiscovery**

  Take advantage of an end-to-end workflow for preserving, collecting, analyzing, and exporting content that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. Legal teams can also manage the entire legal hold notification process by communicating with custodians involved in a case. Learn more about [eDiscovery](ediscovery.md)

- **Data Lifecycle Management**

  Automate your retention coverage by using adaptive policy scopes. This feature allows you to dynamically target policies for retention to specific users, groups, or sites. These policies automatically update when changes occur in your organization. In addition, policies that use adaptive scopes are not subject to location limits. Learn more about [adaptive policy scopes](retention.md#adaptive-or-static-policy-scopes-for-retention).

- **Information Protection**

  Implement Microsoft Purview Information Protection with [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) and [Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention policies](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md) to help you discover, classify, and protect your sensitive content wherever it lives or travels.

  The Information Protection trial provides you with default labels, auto-labeling for documents and emails, and data loss prevention to protect credit card numbers shared in Teams and by devices. The default policies we create for you get you up and running quickly, but you can fully customize them as you want.

    When the trial ends, you'll receive an email that informs you:

  - All files and emails labeled during your trial stay labeled. You can manually remove the labels.
  - You'll be downgraded to your previous Microsoft E3 license package that doesn't support auto-labeling and data loss prevention. Your existing policies will stay turned on unless you turn them off.
  - Any auto-labeling policies cannot be edited after the trial ends, but can be deleted.
  - If you edit DLP policies that include either the Teams or Devices locations after the trial ends, those locations will be removed from the policy.

  For more information about each of these preconfigured features and how they will impact users, see Learn about the [free trial for Microsoft Purview Information Protection](mip-easy-trials.md).

- **Insider Risk Management**

  Leverage artificial intelligence to help you quickly identify, triage, and remediate internal risks. Using logs from Microsoft 365 and Azure services, you can define policies that monitor for risk signals, then take remediation actions such as promoting user education or initiating an investigation.

- **privacy management**

    Privacy management helps your organization understand and manage the personal data in your Microsoft 365 environment, remediate potential privacy risks, and fulfill subject rights requests. [Learn more](/privacy/solutions/privacymanagement/privacy-management)

  Use integrated Microsoft Purview Records Management features to:
  - Classify content as a record to prevent users from editing, as required by regulations, laws, or organizational policy
  - Apply retention labels to content automatically when it matches criteria you specify, using auto-apply label policies
  - Use adaptive scope policies to dynamically target your retention label policies to locations, with no limit on how many locations are included
  - Get full content lifecycle support, including the ability to perform disposition review on contents before they are permanently deleted at the end
