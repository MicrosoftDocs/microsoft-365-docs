# Learn about app policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft app governance detects anomalous app behavior in your Microsoft 365 tenant and generates alerts that you can see, investigate, and resolve. Beyond this built-in detection capability, you can use a set of default templates to create your own app policies that generate other alerts.

These policies for app and user patterns and behaviors can protect your users from using non-compliant or malicious apps and limit the access of risky apps to your tenant data.

See [Administrator roles](app-governance-get-started.md#administrator-roles) for information on which roles can modify policies.

How app policies are the method by which MAPG detects app anomolies resulting in detection (alerts) and remediation (manual or automatic) 


CFA #2 Scenario 1: As an admin, I can quickly set up policies to govern M365 apps in my tenant using MAPG out-of-the-box templates
CFA #2 Scenario 2: As an admin, I can create customized policies to govern M365 apps in my tenant to meet my organizations requirements.
CFA #2 Scenario 3: As an admin or policy reviewer, I can view all policies created in my environment and quickly see which policies have associated alerts. 
CFA #2 Scenario 4: As an admin, I can adjust policies efficiently to meet changing needs.
