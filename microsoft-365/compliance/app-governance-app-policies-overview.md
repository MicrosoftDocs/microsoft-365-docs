# Learn about app policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft app governance detects anomalous app behavior in your Microsoft 365 tenant and generates alerts that you can see, investigate, and resolve. Beyond this built-in detection capability, you can use a set of default templates to create your own app policies that generate other alerts.

These policies for app and user patterns and behaviors can protect your users from using non-compliant or malicious apps and limit the access of risky apps to your tenant data.

See [Administrator roles](app-governance-get-started.md#administrator-roles) for information on which roles can modify policies.
