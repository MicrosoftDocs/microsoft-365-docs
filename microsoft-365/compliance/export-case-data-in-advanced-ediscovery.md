# Export case data in Advanced eDiscovery (classic)

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
The Export process in Advanced eDiscovery enables the exporting of Advanced eDiscovery content and results for external review. 
  
## Guidelines for exporting data

- You can review the export data generated from Advanced eDiscovery, for example, to distribute pertinent elements to the document review team or export to an external document review tool.
    
- You can generate and manipulate the export output at any time during and after Advanced eDiscovery processing. In a standard scenario, significant results are achieved after Relevance training and Batch calculation are successfully completed. For example, you can generate a sample of the 1,000 most relevant files and evaluate Advanced eDiscovery performance before you proceed.
    
- Exporting a large amount of data to a database may have a significant impact on the required database size and the required configuration of the Advanced eDiscovery database.
