# Manage holds in Advanced eDiscovery

You can use an Advanced eDiscovery case to create holds to preserve content that might be relevant to your case. Using the Advanced eDiscovery hold capabilities, you can place holds on custodians and their data sources. Additionally, you can place a non-custodial hold on mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites. You can also place a hold on the group mailbox, SharePoint site, and OneDrive for Business site for an Microsoft 365 Group. Similarly, you can place a hold on the mailbox and site that are associated with Microsoft Teams. When you place content locations on hold, content is held until you release the custodian, remove a specific data location, or delete the hold policy entirely.

## Manage custodian-based holds

In some cases, you may have a set of custodians that you have identified and have decided to preserve their data during the case. In Advanced eDiscovery, when these custodians are placed on hold, the user and their selected data sources are automatically added to a custodian hold policy.

To view the custodian hold policy:

1. In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, click **eDiscovery > Advanced** to display the list of cases in your organization.

2. Go to the **Sources** tab to add custodians within your case. To learn how you can add and place custodians on hold within an Advanced eDiscovery case, see [Add Custodians to a case](add-custodians-to-case.md). If you have already added custodians and placed them on hold, go to step 3.

3. Go to the **Holds** tab and click **CustodianHold\<HoldId>**.

4. On the flyout page, you can see hold statistics for the policy. You can also perform actions like apply a query to your custodian-based hold. For more information about creating a hold query and using conditions, see [Keyword queries and search conditions for Content Search](keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Custodial Holds cannot be turned ON or OFF from the Security & Compliance center Admin center. Aministrator needs to use Powershell to make this change. For more information, See [Set-CaseHoldPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-caseholdpolicy?view=exchange-ps)

## Manage non-custodial holds

When you create a hold, you have the following options to scope the content that is held in the specified content locations:

- You create an infinite hold where all content is placed on hold. Alternatively, you can create a query-based hold where only content that matches a search query is placed on hold.
  
- You can specify a date range to hold only the content that was sent, received, or created within that date range. Alternatively, you can hold all content regardless of when it was sent, received, or created.

To create a non-custodial hold for an Advanced eDiscovery case:

1. In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, click **eDiscovery > Advanced** to display the list of cases in your organization.
  
2. Click **Open** next to the case that you want to create the holds in.
  
3. From the home page for the case, click the **Holds** tab.
  
4. On the **Holds** tab, click **Create**.
  
5. On the **Name your hold** page, give the hold a name. The name of the hold must be unique in your organization.
 
6. (Optional) In the **Description** box, add a description of the hold.
  
7. Click **Next**.
  
8. Choose the content locations that you want to place on hold. You can place mailboxes, sites, and public folders on hold.

   1. **Exchange email** - Click **Choose users, groups, or teams** and then click **Choose users, groups, or teams** again to specify mailboxes to place on hold. Use the search box to find user mailboxes and distribution groups (to place a hold on the mailboxes of group members) to place on hold. You can also place a hold on the associated mailbox for an Microsoft 365 Group or a Microsoft Team. Select the user, group, team check box, click **Choose**, and then click **Done**.
 
      > [!NOTE]
      > When you click **Choose users, groups, or teams** to specify mailboxes to place on hold, the mailbox picker that's displayed is empty. This is by design to enhance performance. To add people to this list, type a name (a minimum of 3 characters) in the search box.

   1. **SharePoint Sites** - Click **Choose sites** and then click **Choose sites** again to specify SharePoint and OneDrive for Business sites to place on hold. Type the URL for each site that you want to place on hold. You can also add the URL for the SharePoint site for an Microsoft 365 Group or a Microsoft Team. Click **Choose**, and then click **Done**.
    
      See the **FAQ** section for tips on putting Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams on hold.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The URL for a user's OneDrive account includes their user principal name (UPN) (for example, `https://alpinehouse-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sarad_alpinehouse_onmicrosoft_com`). In the rare case that a person's UPN is changed, their OneDrive URL will also change to incorporate the new UPN. If a user's OneDrive account is part of a non-custodial hold and their UPN is changed, you need to update the hold and point to the new OneDrive URL. For more information, see [How UPN changes affect the OneDrive URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/upn-changes).

   1. **Exchange public folders** - Move the toggle switch to the All position to put all public folders in your Exchange Online organization on hold. Note that you can't choose specific public folders to put on hold. Leave the toggle switch set to **None** if you don't want to put a hold on public folders.

9. When you're done adding content locations to the hold, click **Next**.
  
10. To create a query-based hold with conditions, complete the following. Otherwise, just click **Next**.
    
    - In the box under **Keywords**, type a search query in the box so that only the content that meets the search criteria is placed on hold. You can specify keywords, message properties, or document properties, such as file names. You can also use more complex queries that use a Boolean operator, such as AND, OR, or NOT. If you leave the keyword box empty, then all content located in the specified content locations will be placed on hold.

    - Click  **Add** conditions to add one or more conditions to narrow the search query for the hold. Each condition adds a clause to the KQL search query that is created and run when you create the hold. For example you can specify a date range so that email or site documents that were created within the date ranged are placed on hold. A condition is logically connected to the keyword query (specified in the keyword box) by the AND operator. That means that items have to satisfy both the keyword query and the condition to be placed on hold.

     For more information about creating a search query and using conditions, see [Keyword queries and search conditions for Content Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/SecurityCompliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions).

11. After configuring a query-based hold, click **Next**.

12. Review your settings, and then click **Create this hold**.

## View hold statistics

After some time, information about the new hold is displayed in the details pane on the **Holds** tab for the selected hold. This information includes the number of mailboxes and sites on hold and statistics about the content that was placed on hold, such as the total number and size of items placed on hold and the last time the hold statistics were calculated. These hold statistics help you identify how much content that's related to the eDiscovery case is being held.

Keep the following things in mind about hold statistics:

- The total number of items on hold indicates the number of items from all content sources that are placed on hold. If you've created a query-based hold, this statistic indicates the number of items that match the query.
  
- The number of items on hold also includes unindexed items found in the content locations. Note that if you create a query-based hold, all unindexed items in the content locations are placed on hold. This includes unindexed items that don't match the search criteria of a query-based hold and unindexed items that might fall outside of a date range condition. This is different than what happens when you run a Content Search, in which unindexed items that don't match the search query or are excluded by a date range condition aren't included in the search results. For more information about unindexed items, see [Partially indexed items in Content Search in Office 365](partially-indexed-items-in-content-search.md). 

- You can get the latest hold statistics by clicking Update statistics to re-run a search estimate that calculates the current number of items on hold.

- If necessary, click Refresh in the toolbar to update the hold statistics in the details pane.

- It's normal for the number of items on hold to increase over time because users whose mailbox or site is on hold are typically sending or receiving new email message and creating new SharePoint and OneDrive for Business documents.

- If a SharePoint site or OneDrive account is moved to a different region in a multi-geo environment, the statistics for that site won't be included in the hold statistics. However, the content in the site will still be on hold. Also, if a site is moved to a different region the URL that's displayed in the hold will not be updated. You'll have to edit the hold and update the URL.

## Place a hold on Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Groups

Microsoft Teams are built on Office 365 Groups. Therefore, placing them on hold in Advanced eDiscovery is very similar. 

- **How do I map an additional Microsoft 365 Groups or Microsoft Teams site to a custodian? And what about placing a non-Custodial hold on Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams?** Microsoft Teams are built on Microsoft 365 Groups. Therefore, placing them on hold in an eDiscovery case is very similar. Keep the following things in mind when placing Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams on hold.
  - To place content located in Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams on hold, you have to specify the mailbox and SharePoint site that associated with a group or team.
  
  - Run the **Get-UnifiedGroup** cmdlet in Exchange Online to view properties for an Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team. This is a good way to get the URL for the site that's associated with an Microsoft 365 Group or a Microsoft Team. For example, the following command displays selected properties for an Microsoft 365 Group named Senior Leadership Team:


    ```console
    Get-UnifiedGroup "Senior Leadership Team" | FL DisplayName,Alias,PrimarySmtpAddress,SharePointSiteUrl
    DisplayName            : Senior Leadership Team
    Alias                  : seniorleadershipteam
    PrimarySmtpAddress     : seniorleadershipteam@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
    SharePointSiteUrl      : https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/seniorleadershipteam
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > To run the Get-UnifiedGroup cmdlet, you have to be assigned the View-Only Recipients role in Exchange Online or be a member of a role group that's assigned the View-Only Recipients role.

 - When a user's mailbox is searched, any Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team that the user is a member of won't be searched. Similarly, when you place an Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team hold, only the group mailbox and group site are placed on hold; the mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites of group members aren't placed on hold unless you explicitly add them as custodians or place their data sources hold. Therefore, if you the need to place an Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team on hold for a specific custodian, consider mapping the group site and group mailbox to the custodian (See Managing Custodians in Advanced eDiscovery). If the Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team is not attributable to a single custodian, consider adding the source to a non-custodial hold. 
 
 - To get a list of the members of a Microsoft 365 Group or Microsoft Team, you can view the properties on the Home > Groups page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Alternatively, you can run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Get-UnifiedGroupLinks <group or team name> -LinkType Members | FL DisplayName,PrimarySmtpAddress
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > To run the **Get-UnifiedGroupLinks** cmdlet, you have to be assigned the View-Only Recipients role in Exchange Online or be a member of a role group that's assigned the View-Only Recipients role.

- Channel conversations that are part of a Microsoft Teams channel are stored in the mailbox that's associated with the Team. Similarly, files that team members share in a channel are stored on the team's SharePoint site. Therefore, you have to place the Microsoft Team mailbox and SharePoint site on hold to retain conversations and files in a channel.
  
- Alternatively, conversations that are part of the Chat list in Microsoft Teams are stored in the mailbox of the user's who participate in the chat.  Files that a user shares in Chat conversations are stored in the OneDrive for Business site of the user who shares the file. Therefore, you have to place the individual user mailboxes and OneDrive for Business sites on hold to retain conversations and files in the Chat list. 
  
- Every Microsoft Team or team channel contains a Wiki for note-taking and collaboration. The Wiki content is automatically saved to a file with a .mht format. This file is stored in the Teams Wiki Data document library on the team's SharePoint site. You can place the content in the Wiki on hold by placing the team's SharePoint site on hold.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The capability to retain Wiki content for a Microsoft Team or team channel (when you place the team's SharePoint site on hold) was released on June 22, 2017. If a team site is on hold, the Wiki content will be retained starting on that date. However, if a team site is on hold and the Wiki content was deleted before June 22, 2017, the Wiki content was not retained.
