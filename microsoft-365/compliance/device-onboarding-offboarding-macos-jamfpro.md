# Onboard and offboard macOS devices into Microsoft Purview solutions using JAMF Pro #

You can use JAMF Pro to onboard macOS devices into Microsoft Purview solutions such as Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this procedure if you ***do not*** have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) deployed to your macOS devices.

**Applies to:**

- [Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP)](./endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md)
- [Insider risk management](insider-risk-management.md)

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

## Before you begin ##

- Make sure your [macOS devices are managed through JAMF pro](https://www.jamf.com/resources/product-documentation/jamf-pro-installation-guide-for-mac/) and are associated with an identity (Azure AD joined UPN) through [JAMF Connect](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-connect) or Microsoft Intune.
- OPTIONAL: Install the v95+ Microsoft Edge browser on your macOS devices for native Endpoint DLP support on Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> The three most recent major releases of macOS are supported.

## Onboard devices into Microsoft Purview solutions using JAMF Pro ##

Onboarding a macOS device into Microsoft Purview solutions is a multi-phase process:
1. [Deploy onboarding packages](#deploy-onboarding-packages)
2. [Configure application preferences](#configure-application-preferences)
3. [Upload the installation package](#upload-the-installation-package)
4. [Deploy System Configuration Profiles](#deploy-system-configuration-profiles)

### Prerequisites

Download the following files.

|File | Description|
|-----|------------|
| [mdatp-nokext.mobileconfig](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/combined/mdatp-nokext.mobileconfig) | This is the bundled file. |
| [schema.json](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/settings/data_loss_prevention/schema.json)| This is the MDE preference file.|

[!INCLUDE [devices-macos-onboarding-tip](../includes/devices-macos-onboarding-tip.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> To download the files:
> 1. Right-click the link and select **Save link as...**. 
> 2. Choose a folder and save the file.

### Get the device onboarding and installation packages

4. Choose **Download onboarding package** and then extract the contents of the device onboarding package. the *DeviceComplianceOnboarding.plist* file is downloaded to the JAMF folder.

5. Choose **Download installation package**.

### Deploy onboarding packages

1. Create a new configuration profile in JAMF Pro. Refer to the [JAMF Pro documentation](https://www.jamf.com/resources/product-documentation/jamf-pro-administrators-guide/). Use the following values:
    - **Name:** *MDATP onboarding for macOS*
    - **Description:** **MDATP EDR onboarding for macOS*

### Configure application preferences

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must use *com.microsoft.wdav* as the **Preference Domain** value. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses this name and *com.microsoft.wdav.ext* to load the managed settings.

1. Sign in to JAMF Pro to create a new configuration profile in JAMF Pro. Refer to the [JAMF Pro documentation](https://www.jamf.com/resources/product-documentation/jamf-pro-administrators-guide/) for more information. Use these values:
    - **Name:** *MDATP MDAV configuration settings*
    - **Description:** *Leave this blank*

6. Choose **Save**.

7. Under **Preference Domain Properties** manually update the settings as follows:
    - **Features**

    - **Data Loss Prevention**
        - **Features** 
            - Use DLP_browser_only_cloud_egress: `enabled` if you want to monitor the browser.
            - Use DLP_ax_only_cloud_egress: `enabled` if you want to monitor only the URL in the browser address bar.
    -  **Antivirus engine** <br>
        If you are *only* deploying data loss prevention, and not MDE, take the following steps:
        - Choose **Real-time Protection**.
        - Choose **Passive mode**.
        - Choose **Apply**.

8. Enter a name for the configuration profile and then choose **Save**.

## Offboard macOS devices using JAMF Pro ##

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Offboarding causes the device to stop sending sensor data to the portal. However,  data from the device, including references to any alerts it has had, will be retained for up to six months.

1. If you are not using MDE, uninstall the application.  See the **Package Deployment** section in the [JAMF Pro documentation](https://www.jamf.com/resources/product-documentation/jamf-pro-administrators-guide/).

2. Restart the macOS device. (Some applications may lose printing functionality until they're restarted.)
