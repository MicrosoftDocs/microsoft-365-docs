# How content is identified for data-governance recommendations

The Microsoft 365 security center and Microsoft 365 compliance center provide recommendations for data governance based on your org's current setup and lets you set things up in a couple clicks.

For example, a recommendation might detect items that contain business-critical content (such as attorney-client privilege or NDA info), and then let you automatically apply a retention label to those items to ensure that they're classified and retained as needed.

This topic lists the data-governance recommendations you might see and describes what content is detected to trigger each one.
