# Get started with sensitivity labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

For information about what sensitivity labels are and how they can help you protect your organization's data, see [Learn about sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md).

If you have [Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection), determine whether you need to migrate labels to the unified labeling platform, and which labeling client to use:
- [How can I determine if my tenant is on the unified labeling platform?](/azure/information-protection/faqs#how-can-i-determine-if-my-tenant-is-on-the-unified-labeling-platform)
- [Choose your Windows labeling solution](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/use-client#choose-your-windows-labeling-solution)

When you're ready to start protecting your organization's data by using sensitivity labels:

1. **Create the labels.** Create and name your sensitivity labels according to your organization's classification taxonomy for different sensitivity levels of content. Use common names or terms that make sense to your users. If you don't already have an established taxonomy, consider starting with label names such as Personal, Public, General, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. You can then use sublabels to group similar labels by category. When you create a label, use the  tooltip text to help users select the appropriate label.
    
    For more extensive guidance for defining a classification taxonomy, download the white paper, "Data Classification & Sensitivity Label Taxonomy" from the [Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/DataClassificationWhitepaper).

2. **Define what each label can do.** Configure the protection settings you want associated with each label. For example, you might want lower sensitivity content (such as a "General" label) to have just a header or footer applied, while higher sensitivity content (such as a "Confidential" label) should have a watermark and encryption.

3. **Publish the labels.** After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users. So for example, you could pilot your sensitivity labels by assigning a label policy to just a few users. Then when you're ready to roll out the labels across your organization, you can create a new label policy for your labels and this time, specify all users.

The basic flow for deploying and applying sensitivity labels:

## Subscription and licensing requirements for sensitivity labels

A number of different subscriptions support sensitivity labels and the licensing requirements for users depend on the features you use.

To see the options for licensing your users to benefit from Microsoft 365 compliance features, see the [Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance). For sensitivity labels, see the [Information Protection](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection) section and related PDF or Excel download.

## Permissions required to create and manage sensitivity labels

Members of your compliance team who will create sensitivity labels need permissions to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 security center, or the Security & Compliance Center. 

By default, global administrators for your tenant have access to these admin centers and can give compliance officers and other people access, without giving them all of the permissions of a tenant admin. For this delegated limited admin access, add users to the **Compliance Data Administrator**, **Compliance Administrator**, or **Security Administrator** role group. 

Alternatively to using the default roles, you can create a new role group and add either **Sensitivity Label Administrator** or **Organization Configuration** roles to this group. For a read-only role, use **Sensitivity Label Reader**. 

For instructions to add users to the default roles or create your own role groups, see [Give users access to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](../security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

These permissions are required only to create and configure sensitivity labels and their label policies. They are not required to apply the labels in apps or services. If additional permissions are needed for specific configurations that relate to sensitivity labels, those permissions will be listed in their respective documentation instructions.

## Deployment strategy for sensitivity labels
A successful strategy to deploy sensitivity labels for an organization is to create a working virtual team that identifies and manages the business and technical requirements, proof of concept testing, internal checkpoints and approvals, and final deployment for the production environment.

Using the table in the next section, we recommend identifying your top one or two scenarios that map to your most impactful business requirements. After these scenarios are deployed, return to the list to identify the next one or two priorities for deployment.

You'll find additional general deployment guidance in the downloadable Data Loss Prevention and Microsoft Information Protection Deployment Acceleration Guide. For more information, see the blog post, [Microsoft 365 Information Protection and Compliance Deployment Acceleration Guides](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/microsoft-365-information-protection-and-compliance-deployment/ba-p/2076404).

## End-user documentation for sensitivity labels

The most effective end-user documentation will be customized guidance and instructions you provide for the label names and configurations you choose. For built-in labeling, you can use the label policy setting **Provide users with a link to a custom help page** to specify an internal link for this documentation. Users can then easily access it by selecting **Learn More** from the **Sensitivity** button on the Office ribbon for Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook.

To help you write your customized documentation, see the following blog post for a download package that you can use to train users and drive adoption: [End User Training for Sensitivity Labels in M365 – How to Accelerate Your Adoption](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/end-user-training-for-sensitivity-labels-in-m365-how-to/ba-p/1750880).
