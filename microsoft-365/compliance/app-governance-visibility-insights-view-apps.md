# View your apps

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft app governance allows you to quickly gain deep insights into the Microsoft 365 apps in your tenant. For example, you can see:

- A list of OAuth-enabled apps in the tenant that use the Microsoft Graph API, together with relevant app metadata and usage data.
- App details with deeper insights and information by selecting an app in the list.

## Getting a list of all the apps in your tenant

For a summary of apps in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Apps**.

![The MAPG app summary page in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-apps.png)

>[!Note]
> Your sign-in account must have one of [these roles](app-governance-get-started.md#administrator-roles) to view any app governance data.
>

You will see a list of apps and this information:

- App Name
- Publisher
- App certification

  Indicates whether the app is compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft.

- Last modified

  Shows the date app governance was installed in client if that date is more recent than the date the app was last modified.

- Date installed
- Privilege level
- Number of users
- Data access

  The sum of the appâ€™s data upload and download in the tenant over the last day, along with the change over the prior day.

App governance sorts the app list by **App name** by default. To sort the list by another app attribute, select the attribute name.

You can also select **Search** to search for an app by name.

## Getting detailed information on an app

For detailed information on a specific app in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App governance > Apps page > *app name***.

![The app governance app details pane in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-apps-app.png)

The app details pane provides additional information on these tabs:

| Tab name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Details | See additional data on the app such as the date first consented and the App ID. To see the properties of the app as registered in Azure AD, select **View app in Azure AD**. |
| Usage | See the data accessed by the app in the tenant, plot the data usage, and show usage by the top \<x> users and users with [priority accounts](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts). |
| Users | See a list of users who are using the app, whether they are a priority account, and the amount of data downloaded and uploaded. |
| Permissions | See a summary of the permissions granted to and used by the app and the list of specific permissions. See the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference) for more information. |
|||

For an enabled app, there is also a **Disable app** control to disable the use of the selected app and an **Enable app** control to enable the use of the disabled app. These actions require these [administrator roles](app-governance-get-started.md#administrator-roles):

- Compliance Administrator
- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator
