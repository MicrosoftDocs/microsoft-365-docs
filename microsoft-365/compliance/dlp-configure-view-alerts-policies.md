# Configure and view alerts for data loss prevention polices

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies can take protective actions to prevent unintentional sharing of sensitive items. When an action is taken on a sensitive item, you can be notified by configuring alerts for DLP. This article shows you how to define rich alert policies that are linked to your data loss prevention (DLP) policies. You'll see how to use the
new DLP alert management dashboard in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 compliance center</a> to view alerts, events, and associated metadata for DLP policy violations.

## Features

The following features are part of this:

-   **DLP alert management dashboard**: In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 compliance center</a>, this dashboard shows
    alerts for DLP policies that are enforced on the following workloads:

    -   Exchange
    -   SharePoint
    -   OneDrive
    -   Teams
    -   Devices
-   **Advanced alert configuration options**: These options are part of the DLP policy authoring flow. Use them to create rich alert configurations. You can create a single-event alert or an aggregated alert, based on the number of events or the size of the leaked data.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites:

-   Licensing for the DLP alerts management dashboard
-   Licensing for alert configuration options
-   Roles

### Licensing for the DLP alert management dashboard

All eligible tenants for Office 365 DLP can access the new DLP alert management dashboard. To get started, you should be eligible for Office
365 DLP for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. For more information about the licensing requirements for Office 365 DLP, see [Which licenses provide the rights for a user to benefit from the service?](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#which-licenses-provide-the-rights-for-a-user-to-benefit-from-the-service-16).

Customers who use [Endpoint DLP](endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md) who are eligible for [Teams DLP](dlp-microsoft-teams.md) will see their endpoint DLP policy alerts and Teams DLP policy alerts in the DLP alert management dashboard.

### Licensing for alert configuration options

- **Single-event alert configuration**: Organizations that have an E1, F1, or G1 subscription or an E3 or G3 subscription can create alert policies only where an alert is triggered every time an activity occurs.
- **Aggregated alert configuration**: To configure aggregate alert policies based on a threshold, you must have either of the following configurations:
  - An E5 or G5 subscription
  - An E1, F1, or G1 subscription or an E3 or G3 subscription that includes one of the following features:
    - Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2
    - Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance
    - Microsoft 365 eDiscovery and Audit add-on license

### Roles

If you want to view the DLP alert management dashboard or to edit the alert configuration options in a DLP policy, you must be a member of one of these role groups:

-   Compliance Administrator
-   Compliance Data Administrator
-   Security Administrator
-   Security Operator
-   Security Reader

To access the DLP alert management dashboard, you need the Manage alerts role and either of the following roles:

-   DLP Compliance Management
-   View-Only DLP Compliance Management

## Alert configuration experience

If you're eligible for [aggregated alert configuration options](#licensing-for-alert-configuration-options), then you see the following options inline in the DLP policy authoring experience.

:::image type="content" source="../media/incident-reports-options-aggregated-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing options for incident reports for users who are eligible for aggregated alert configuration options." border="false":::

This configuration allows you to set up a policy to generate an alert:

- every time an activity matches the policy conditions
- when the defined threshold is met or exceeded
- based on the number of activities
- based on the volume of exfiltrated data

To prevent a flood of notification emails, all matches that occur within a one-minute time window and are for the same DLP rule and on the same location are grouped together in the same alert. The one minute aggregation time window feature is available in: 

- An E5 or G5 subscription
- An E1, F1, or G1 subscription or an E3 or G3 subscription that includes one of the following features:
    - Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2
    - Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance
    - Microsoft 365 eDiscovery and Audit add-on license
 
For organizations that have an E1, F1, or G1 subscription or an E3 or G3 subscription, the aggregation time window is 15 minutes.
