# Audit New Search

Your organization requires access to critical audit log event data to gain insight and further investigate user activities. Previously, your search jobs in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal UI were limited in their ability to create concurrent audit search jobs and review historical search jobs. These critical audit search jobs also had a dependency on the browser window remaining open in order to complete.

The Audit New Search builds upon the existing search functionalities and includes the following key improvements:

- Search jobs initiated via the compliance portal UI no longer require the web browser window to remain open in order to complete. These jobs will continue to run even after the browser window is closed.
- Completed search jobs are now stored for 30 days, giving customers the ability to reference historical audit searches. These search jobs are presented in the UI, listing the search name, search job status, progress %, Number of results, Creation Time, and Searched by.
- Each admin Audit account user can have a maximum of 10 concurrent search jobs in progress with a maximum of one unfiltered search job.

## Information to get started

View the available Microsoft Purview Audit documentation as the search job creation and export experiences have many parallels with the current search experience:

- [Search the audit log in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](audit-log-search.md) (note that PowerShell isn't yet compatible with Audit Search V2)
- [Detailed properties in the audit log](audit-log-detailed-properties.md)
- [Export, configure, and view audit log records](audit-log-export-records.md)

Additional information:

- Searching via an EXO PowerShell session using the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet isn't compatible with the New Search at this time.
- Search jobs can take in the following criteria: Date Range, Time Range, Search Job Name, Activities, Users, Files, Folders, and Sites.
- Searching and filtering using date, time, search name, activities, and users are all fully functional
- Audit Log data will be stored for the defined retention period, regardless of a search job being deleted

## Frequently asked questions

- **Is there a maximum number of search jobs per user?**
  There's a maximum of 10 *In progress* search jobs per user. If a user requires more than 10 search jobs, they must wait for an *In progress* job to finish or delete a search job. We would appreciate your feedback on this limit.
- **Does deletion of a search job delete the back-end data?**
  No, the deletion of the search job will only delete the search job definition and the associated search result.
