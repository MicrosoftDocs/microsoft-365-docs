# Get started with Microsoft Service Trust Portal

The Microsoft Service Trust Portal provides a variety of content, tools, and other resources about how Microsoft cloud services protect your data, and how you can manage cloud data security and compliance for your organization.

## Accessing the Service Trust Portal

The Service Trust Portal is Microsoft's public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information associated with Microsoft’s cloud services. STP users can download audit reports produced by external auditors and gain insight from Microsoft-authored whitepapers that provide details on how Microsoft cloud services protect your data, and how you can manage cloud data security and compliance for your organization. To access some of the resources on the Service Trust Portal, you must log in as an authenticated user with your Microsoft cloud services account (Azure Active Directory organization account) and review and accept the Microsoft Non-Disclosure Agreement for Compliance Materials.

### Existing customers

Existing customers can access the Service Trust Portal at <https://aka.ms/STP> with one of the following online subscriptions (trial or paid):

- Microsoft 365
- Dynamics 365
- Azure

 > [!NOTE]
 > Azure Active Directory accounts associated with organizations have access to the full range of documents and resources like Compliance Manager.

### New customers and customers evaluating Microsoft online services

To create a new account or to create a trial account, use one of the following sign-up forms (also used for trial accounts) to get access to the STP.

- Sign up for a new [Microsoft 365 Apps for business trial account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=507653) or a new [Office 365 Enterprise trial account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279)
