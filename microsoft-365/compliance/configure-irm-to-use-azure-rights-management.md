# Configure IRM to use Azure Rights Management

With the release of the new capabilities for Office 365 Message Encryption (OME), you no longer need to set up IRM separately. Microsoft does not recommend setting up new deployments using legacy OME and IRM with Azure Rights Management. For more information about the new OME capabilities, see the [Office 365 Message Encryption FAQ](./ome-faq.yml). If you're ready to get started using the new OME capabilities within your organization, see [Set up new Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities built on top of Azure Information Protection](./set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities.md).
