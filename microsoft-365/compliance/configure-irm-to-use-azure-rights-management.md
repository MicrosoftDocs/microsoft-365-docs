# Configure IRM to use Azure Rights Management

With the release of Microsoft Purview Message Encryption, you no longer need to set up IRM separately. Microsoft does not recommend setting up new deployments using legacy OME and IRM with Azure Rights Management. For more information about the Microsoft Purview Message Encryption, see the [Message encryption FAQ](./ome-faq.yml). If you're ready to get started using Microsoft Purview Message Encryption within your organization, see [Set up Microsoft Purview Message Encryption](./set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities.md).
