# Document metadata fields in Advanced eDiscovery

The following table lists the metadata fields for documents in a review set in a case in Advanced eDiscovery. The table provides the following information:

- **Field name** and **Display field name:** The name of the metadata field and the name of the field that's displayed when viewing the file metadata of a selected document in a review set. Some metadata fields aren't included when viewing the file metadata of a document. These fields are highlighted with an asterisk (*).

- **Searchable field name:** The name of the property that you can search for when running a [review set query](review-set-search.md). A blank cell means that you can't search for the field in a review set query.

- **Exported field name:** The name of the metadata field that included when documents are exported.  A blank cell means the field isn't included with the exported metadata.

- **Description:** A description of the metadata field.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Keywords** field in [review set search](./review-set-search.md) uses Keyword Query Language (KQL). The fields listed in the **Searchable field name** column can be used in the **Keywords** field in a review set search to form complex queries without you having to use the query builder. For more information about KQL, see [Keyword Query Language syntax reference](/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference).
