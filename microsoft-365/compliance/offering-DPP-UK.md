# Digital Production Partnership (DPP) United Kingdom

## About the DPP

Broadcasters are confronting increasingly frequent cyberattacks against their websites, IT infrastructure, and systems. In response to these threats, the [Digital Production Partnership](https://www.thedpp.com/) (DPP) partnered with the [**North American Broadcasters Association**](https://nabanet.com/) (NABA) to develop the [Broadcasters Cyber Security Requirements for Suppliers](https://nabanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NABA_DPP_CyberSecurity_Requirements_3.pdf). Chief information security officers from UK broadcasters have endorsed these as the minimum cybersecurity requirements.  
  
The DPP then worked with broadcasters and supplier security experts to create a self-assessment inventory, the [Committed to Security Programme Broadcast Checklist](https://dpp-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CTS_BroadcastChecklist.xlsx), which enables suppliers to demonstrate to broadcasters their deployment of cybersecurity best practices. This work led to establishing a formal [DPP Committed to Security Programme](https://www.thedpp.com/tech/security/committed-to-security/) launched in October 2017, with two different marks: one for Broadcast and one for Production.

## Microsoft and the DPP

Microsoft Azure has been awarded the DPP Committed to Security Mark for Broadcast after completing the Digital Production Partnership (DPP) self-assessment questionnaire, the *Committed to Security Programme Broadcast Checklist*. It required documenting a set of best practices for documentation and testing, authentication, and security controls. [Eurofins Digital Testing](https://www.eurofins-digitaltesting.com/), a quality assurance expert and DPP member, reviewed and signed off on the Microsoft response and submitted it to the DPP for final validation.  
  
This means that broadcasters and other media customers using Azure can have confidence that its robust security and resilient service can help meet the unique demands of the broadcast industry, from program development to transmission.
