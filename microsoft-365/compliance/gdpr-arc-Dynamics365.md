# Dynamics 365 accountability readiness checklist for the GDPR

## **1. Introduction**

This accountability readiness checklist provides a convenient way to access information you may need to support GDPR when using Microsoft Dynamics 365. The checklist is organized using the titles and reference number (in parenthesis for each checklist topic) of a set of privacy and security controls for personal data processors drawn from *ISO/IEC CD 27552 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Enhancement to ISO/IEC 27001 for privacy management – Requirements. *

You can manage the items in this checklist with the Compliance Manager [[15](gdpr-arc-Dynamics365.md#15)] by referencing the Control ID and Control Title under *Customer Managed Controls* in the GDPR tile.

In addition, items in this checklist under 5. Data Protection & Security references controls listed in Compliance Manager, located in the Service Trust portal at https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager. Reviewing the Microsoft Implementation Details for these controls provides additional explanation of the Microsoft approach to fulfilling the customer considerations in the checklist item.

This control structure is also used to organize the presentation of the internal controls that Microsoft Dynamics365 implements to support GDPR, which you can download here: https://aka.ms/gdprcontrols.
