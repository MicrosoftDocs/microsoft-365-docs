description: Use Content Search in the Security & Compliance Center to perform targeted collections, which ensure items are located in a specific mailbox or site folder.

# Use Content Search for targeted collections

The Content Search feature in the Security &amp; Compliance Center doesn't provide a direct way in the UI to search specific folders in Exchange mailboxes or SharePoint and OneDrive for Business sites. However, it's possible to search specific folders (called a *targeted collection*) by specifying the folder ID property for email or path (DocumentLink) property for sites in the actual search query syntax. Using Content Search to perform a targeted collection is useful when you're confident that items responsive to a case or privileged items are located in a specific mailbox or site folder. You can use the script in this article to obtain the folder ID for mailbox folders or the path (DocumentLink) for folders on a SharePoint and OneDrive for Business site. Then you can use the folder ID or path in a search query to return items located in the folder.

> [!NOTE]
> To return content located in a folder in a SharePoint or OneDrive for Business site, the script in this topic uses the DocumentLink managed property instead of the Path property. The DocumentLink property is more robust than the Path property because it will return all content in a folder, whereas the Path property won't return some media files.

## Before you run a targeted collection

- You have to be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group in the Security &amp; Compliance Center to run the script in Step 1. For more information, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions](assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).

    Additionally, you have to be assigned the Mail Recipients role in your Exchange Online organization. This is required to run the **Get-MailboxFolderStatistics** cmdlet, which is included in the script in Step 1. By default, the Mail Recipients role is assigned to the Organization Management and Recipient Management role groups in Exchange Online. For more information about assigning permissions in Exchange Online, see [Manage role group members](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=692102). You could also create a custom role group, assign the Mail Recipients role to it, and then add the members who need to run the script in Step 1. For more information, see [Manage role groups](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=730688).

- Each time you run the script in Step 1, a new remote PowerShell session is created. So you could use up all the remote PowerShell sessions available to you. To prevent this from happening, you can run the following command to disconnect your active remote PowerShell sessions.

  ```powershell
  Get-PSSession | Remove-PSSession
  ```

    For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554).

- The script includes minimal error handling. The primary purpose of the script is to quickly display a list of mailbox folder IDs or site paths that can be used in the search query syntax of a Content Search to perform a targeted collection.

- The sample script provided in this topic isn't supported under any Microsoft standard support program or service. The sample script is provided AS IS without warranty of any kind. Microsoft further disclaims all implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk arising out of the use or performance of the sample script and documentation remains with you. In no event shall Microsoft, its authors, or anyone else involved in the creation, production, or delivery of the scripts be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the sample scripts or documentation, even if Microsoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
## Step 1: Run the script to get a list of folders for a mailbox or site

The script that you run in this first step will return a list of mailbox folders or SharePoint and OneDrive for Business folders, and the corresponding folder ID or path for each folder. When you run this script, it will prompt you for the following information.
  
- **Email address or site URL**: Type an email address of the custodian to return a list of Exchange mailbox folders and folder IDs. Or type the URL for a SharePoint site or a OneDrive for Business site to return a list of paths for the specified site. Here are some examples:

  - **Exchange**: stacig@contoso.onmicrosoft.com 

  - **SharePoint**: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing 

  - **OneDrive for Business**: https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/stacig_contoso_onmicrosoft_com 

- **Your user credentials**: The script will use your credentials to connect to Exchange Online and the Security & Compliance Center with remote PowerShell. As previously explained, you have to assign the appropriate permissions to successfully run this script.

To display a list of mailbox folders or site documentlink (path) names:
  
1. Save the following text to a Windows PowerShell script file by using a filename suffix of .ps1; for example, `GetFolderSearchParameters.ps1`.
    
   ```powershell
   #########################################################################################################
   # This PowerShell script will prompt you for:                                #
   #    * Admin credentials for a user who can run the Get-MailboxFolderStatistics cmdlet in Exchange    #
   #      Online and who is an eDiscovery Manager in the Security & Compliance Center.            #
   # The script will then:                                            #
   #    * If an email address is supplied: list the folders for the target mailbox.            #
   #    * If a SharePoint or OneDrive for Business site is supplied: list the documentlinks (folder paths) #
   #    * for the site.                                                                                    #
   #    * In both cases, the script supplies the correct search properties (folderid: or documentlink:)    #
   #      appended to the folder ID or documentlink to use in a Content Search.                #
   # Notes:                                                #
   #    * For SharePoint and OneDrive for Business, the paths are searched recursively; this means the     #
   #      the current folder and all sub-folders are searched.                        #
   #    * For Exchange, only the specified folder will be searched; this means sub-folders in the folder    #
   #      will not be searched.  To search sub-folders, you need to use the specify the folder ID for    #
   #      each sub-folder that you want to search.                                #
   #    * For Exchange, only folders in the user's primary mailbox will be returned by the script.        #

   ```

2. On your local computer, open Windows PowerShell and go to the folder where you saved the script.

3. Run the script; for example:

   ```powershell
   .\GetFolderSearchParameters.ps1
   ```

4. Enter the information that the script prompts you for.

    The script displays a list of mailbox folders or site folders for the specified user. Leave this window open so that you can copy a folder ID or documentlink name and paste it in to a search query in Step 2.

    > [!TIP]
    > Instead of displaying a list of folders on the computer screen, you can re-direct the output of the script to a text file. This file will be saved to the folder where the script is located. For example, to redirect the script output to a text file, run the following command in Step 3:  `.\GetFolderSearchParameters.ps1 > StacigFolderIds.txt` Then you can copy a folder ID or documentlink from the file to use in a search query.
  
### Script output for mailbox folders

If you're getting mailbox folder IDs, the script connects to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell, runs the **Get-MailboxFolderStatisics** cmdlet, and then displays the list of the folders from the specified mailbox. For every folder in the mailbox, the script displays the name of the folder in the **FolderPath** column and the folder ID in the **FolderQuery** column. Additionally, the script adds the prefix of **folderId** (which is the name of the mailbox property) to the folder ID. Because the **folderid** property is a searchable property, you'll use  `folderid:<folderid>` in a search query in Step 2 to search that folder. The script displays a maximum of 100 mailbox folders.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script in this article includes encoding logic that converts the 64-character folder Id values that are returned by **Get-MailboxFolderStatistics** to the same 48-character format that is indexed for search. If you just run the **Get-MailboxFolderStatistics** cmdlet in PowerShell to obtain a folder Id (instead of running the script in this article), a search query that uses that folder Id value will fail. You have to run the script to get the correctly-formatted folder Ids that can be used in a Content Search.
  
Here's an example of the output returned by the script for mailbox folders.
  
![Example of the  list of mailbox folders and folder IDs returned by the script](../media/cd739207-eb84-4ebf-a03d-703f3d3a797d.png)
  
The example in Step 2 shows the query used to search the Purges subfolder in the user's Recoverable Items folder.
  
### Script output for site folders

If you're getting the path of the **documentlink** property from SharePoint or OneDrive for Business sites, the script connects to the Security & Compliance Center using remote PowerShell, creates a new Content Search that searches the site for folders, and then displays a list of the folders located in the specified site. The script displays the name of each folder and adds the prefix of **documentlink** to the folder URL. Because the **documentlink** property is a searchable property, you'll use `documentlink:<path>` property:value pair in a search query in Step 2 to search that folder. The script displays a maximum of 200 site folders. If there are more than 200 site folders, the newest ones are displayed.
  
Here's an example of the output returned by the script for site folders.
  
![Example of the list of documentlink names for site folders returned by the script](../media/519e8347-7365-4067-af78-96c465dc3d15.png)
  
## Step 2: Use a folder ID or documentlink to perform a targeted collection

After you've run the script to collect a list of folder IDs or document links for a specific user, the next step to go to the Security & Compliance Center and create a new Content Search to search a specific folder. You'll use the  `folderid:<folderid>` or  `documentlink:<path>` property:value pair in the search query that you configure in the Content Search keyword box (or as the value for the  *ContentMatchQuery*  parameter if you use the **New-ComplianceSearch** cmdlet). You can combine the  `folderid` or  `documentlink` property with other search parameters or search conditions. If you only include the  `folderid` or  `documentlink` property in the query, the search will return all items located in the specified folder.
  
1. Go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com).

2. Sign in using the account and credentials that you used to run the script in Step 1.

3. In the left pane of the Security & Compliance Center, click **Search** \> **Content search**, and then click **New** ![Add icon](../media/O365-MDM-CreatePolicy-AddIcon.gif).

4. On the **New search** page, type a name for the Content Search. This name has to be unique in your organization. 

5. Under **Where do you want us to look**, do one of the following, based on whether you're searching a mailbox folder or a site folder:

    - Click **Choose specific mailboxes to search** and then add the same mailbox that you specified when you ran the script in Step 1.

      Or

    - Click **Choose specific sites to search** and then add the same site URL that you specified when you ran the script in Step 1.

6. Click **Next**.

7. In the keyword box on the **What do you want us to look for** page, paste the  `folderid:<folderid>` or  `documentlink:<path>` value that was returned by the script in Step 1. 

    For example, the query in the following screenshot will search for any item in the Purges subfolder in the user's Recoverable Items folder (the value of the `folderid` property for the Purges subfolder is shown in the screenshot in Step 1):

    ![Paste the folderid or documentlink in to the keyword box of the search query](../media/84057516-b663-48a4-a78f-8032a8f8da80.png)
  
8. Click **Search** to start the targeted collection search. 
  
### Examples of search queries for targeted collections

Here are some examples of using the  `folderid` and  `documentlink` properties in a search query to perform a targeted collection. Placeholders are used for  `folderid:<folderid>` and  `documentlink:<path>` to save space. 
  
- This example searches three different mailbox folders. You could use similar query syntax to search the hidden folders in a user's Recoverable Items folder.

  ```powershell
  folderid:<folderid> OR folderid:<folderid> OR folderid:<folderid>
  ```

- This example searches a mailbox folder for items that contain an exact phrase.

  ```powershell
  folderid:<folderid> AND "Contoso financial results"
  ```

- This example searches a site folder (and any subfolders) for documents that contain the letters "NDA" in the title.

  ```powershell
  documentlink:<path> AND filename:nda
  ```

- This example searches a site folder (and any subfolder) for documents there were changed within a date range.

  ```powershell
  documentlink:<path> AND (lastmodifiedtime>=01/01/2017 AND lastmodifiedtime<=01/21/2017)
  ```

## More information

Keep the following things in mind when using the script in this article to perform targeted collections.
  
- The script doesn't remove any folders from the results. So some folders listed in the results might be unsearchable (or return zero items) because they contain system-generated content or because they only contain subfolders and not mailbox items.

- This script only returns folder information for the user's primary mailbox. It doesn't return information about folders in the user's archive mailbox. To return information about folders in the user's archive mailbox, you can edit the script. To do this, change the line `$folderStatistics = Get-MailboxFolderStatistics $emailAddress` to `$folderStatistics = Get-MailboxFolderStatistics $emailAddress -Archive` and then save and run the edited script. This change will return the folder IDs for folders and subfolders in the user's archive mailbox. To search the entire archive mailbox, you can connect all folder ID property:value pairs with an `OR` operator in a search query.

- When searching mailbox folders, only the specified folder (identified by its `folderid` property) will be searched; subfolders won't be searched. To search subfolders, you need to use the  folder ID for the subfolder that you want to search.

- When searching site folders, the folder (identified by its `documentlink` property) and all subfolders will be searched. 

- When exporting the results of a search in which you only specified the `folderid` property in the search query, you can choose the first export option, "All items, excluding ones that have an unrecognized format, are encrypted, or weren't indexed for other reasons." All items in the folder will always be exported regardless of their indexing status because the folder ID is always indexed.
