# Query and filter content in a review set

In most cases, it will be useful to dig deeper into the content in a review set and organize it to facilitate a more efficient review. Using filters and queries in a review set helps you focus on a subset of documents that meet the criteria of your review.

## Default filters

In a review set, there are five default filters that are pre-loaded in the review set:

- Keywords
- Date
- Sender/Author
- Subject/Title
- Tags

Click each filter to expand it and assign a value. Click outside the filter to automatically apply the filter to the review set. The following screenshot shows the Date filter configured to show documents within a date range.

## Add or remove filters

To add or remove filters that are displayed for the review set, select **Filters** to open the filter panel, which is displayed on a flyout page. 

![Filter panel.](../media/FilterPanel.png)

The available filters are organized in four sections:

- **Search**: Filters that provide different search capabilities.

- **Analytics & predictive coding**: Filters for properties generated and added to documents when you run the **Document & email analytic** job or use predictive coding models.

- **IDs**: Filters for all ID properties of documents.

- **Item properties**: Filters for document properties. 

Expand each section and select or deselect filters to add or remove them in the filter set. When you add a filter, it's displayed in the filter set.

> [!NOTE]
> When you expand a section in the filter panel, you'll notice that the default filter types are selected. You can keep these selected or deselect them and removed them from the filter set. 

## Filter types

Every searchable field in a review set has a corresponding filter that you can use for filter items based on a specific field.

There are multiple types of filters:

- **Freetext**: A freetext filter is applied to text fields such as "Subject". You can list multiple search terms by separating them with a comma.

- **Date**: A date filter is used for date fields such as "Last modified date".

- **Search options**: A search options filter provides a list of possible values (each value is displayed with a checkbox that you can select) for particular fields in the review. This filter is used for fields, such as "Sender", where there is a finite number of possible values in the review set.

- **Keyword**: A keyword condition is a specific instance of freetext condition that you can use to search for terms. You can also use KQL-like query language in this type of filter. For more information, see the Query language and Advanced query builder sections in this topic.

## Include and exclude filter relationships

You have the option to change the include and exclude relationship for a particular filter. For example, in the Tag filter, you can exclude items that are tagged with a particular tag by selecting **Equals none of** in the dropdown filter.

## Save filters as queries

After you are satisfied with your filters, you can save the filter combination as a filter query. This lets you apply the filter in the future review sessions.

To save a filter, select **Save the query** and name it. You or other reviewers can run previously saved filter queries by selecting the **Saved filter queries** dropdown and selecting a filter query to apply to review set documents.

To delete a filter query, open the filter panel and select the trashcan icon next to the query.

## Query language

In addition to using filters, you can also use a KQL-like query language in the Keywords filter to build your review set search query. The query language for review set queries supports standard Boolean operators, such as **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **NEAR**. It also supports a single-character wildcard (?) and a multi-character wildcard (*).

## Advanced query builder

You can also build more advanced queries to search for documents in a review set.

1. Open the filter panel, select **Filters**, and expand the **Search** section.

  ![Add a KQL filter.](../media/AddKQLFilter.png)

2. Select the **KQL** filter and click **Open query builder**.

   In this panel, you can create complex KQL queries by using the query builder. You can add conditions or add condition groups that are made up of multiple conditions that are logically connected by **AND** or **OR** relationships.
