# Add or remove members from a data investigation

You can add or remove members to manage who can access the investigation. To see and access data investigations, members must be part of Data Investigator role group or a custom role group with Data Investigation Management role assigned. Data investigator who created the investigation is automatically added as a member.

1. From the **Data Investigations (Preview)** page, go to your investigation.

2. Go to **Settings** and select "Access & Permissions".
 
3. Select **Update**.
 
4. Under **Manage members**, select Add Icon Add to add members to the investigation. You can also choose to add a role group to the investigation. Under **Manage role groups**, select Add Icon Add. 
     Keep in mind that role groups control permission to access the investigation. That means you can only add people who are assigned Data Investigator role group or custom role groups with Data Investigation Management role.
 
5. In the list of people or role groups that can be added as members of the investigation, select the check box next to the names of the people or role groups that you want to add.

6. After you've selected the people or role groups to add as members of the group, select **Add**.

7. In **Manage this investigation**, select **Save** to save the new list of investigation members.

8. Select **Save** to save the new list of investigation members.
