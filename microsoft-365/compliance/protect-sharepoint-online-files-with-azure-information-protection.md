# Protect SharePoint Online files with Azure Information Protection

 **Summary:** Apply Azure Information Protection to protect files in a highly confidential SharePoint Online team site.
  
Use the steps in this article to configure Azure Information Protection to provide encryption and permissions for files. These files can be added to a SharePoint library configured for highly confidential protection. Or, you can open a file directly from the site and use the Azure Information Protection client to add encryption. The encryption and permissions protection travels with a file even when it is downloaded from the site. 

These steps are part of a larger solution for configuring highly confidential protection for SharePoint sites and the files within these sites. For more information, see [Secure SharePoint Online sites and files](/security/office-365-security/secure-sharepoint-online-sites-and-files.md). 

Using Azure Information Protection for files in SharePoint Online is not recommended for all customers, but is an option for customers who need this level of protection for a subset of files.

Some important notes about this solution:
- When Azure Information Protection encryption is applied to files stored in Office 365, the service cannot process the contents of these files. Co-authoring, eDiscovery, search, Delve, and other collaborative features do not work. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies can only work with the metadata (including Office 365 labels) but not the contents of these files (such as credit card numbers within files).

- This solution requires a user to select a label that applies the protection from Azure Information Protection. If you require automatic encryption and the ability for SharePoint to index and inspect the files, consider using Information Rights Management (IRM) in SharePoint Online. When you configure a SharePoint library for IRM, files are automatically encrypted when they are downloaded for editing.  SharePoint IRM includes limitations that might influence your decision. For more information, see [Set up Information Rights Management (IRM) in SharePoint admin center](https://support.office.com/article/Set-up-Information-Rights-Management-IRM-in-SharePoint-admin-center-239CE6EB-4E81-42DB-BF86-A01362FED65C).

## Admin setup
First, use the instructions in [Activate Azure RMS with the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/activate-office365) for your Office 365 subscription.
  
Next, configure Azure Information Protection with a new scoped policy and sub-label for protection and permissions of your highly confidential SharePoint Online team site.
  
1. Sign in to the admin center with an account that has the Security Administrator or Company Administrator role. For help, see [Where to sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/Article/Where-to-sign-in-to-Office-365-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4).
    
2. In a separate tab of your browser, go to the Azure portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)).
    
3. If this is the first time you are configuring Azure Information Protection, see these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/configure-policy#to-access-the-azure-information-protection-blade-for-the-first-time).

4. In the list pane, click **All services**, type **information**, and then click **Azure Information Protection**.

5. Click **Labels**.
    
6. Right-click the **Highly Confidential** label, and then click **Add a sub-label**.
    
7. Type a name for the sub-label in **Name** and a description of the sub-label in **Description**.
    
8. In **Set permissions for documents and emails containing this label**, click **Protect**.
    
9. In the **Protection** section, click **Azure (cloud key)**.
    
10. On the **Protection** blade, under **Protection settings**, click **Add permissions**.
    
11. On the **Add permissions** blade, under **Specify users and groups**, click **Browse directory**.
    
12. On the **AAD Users and Groups** pane, select the site members access group for your highly sensitive SharePoint Online team site, and then click **Select**.
    
13. Under **Choose permissions from the preset or set custom**, click **Custom**, and then click the **View Rights**, **Edit Content**, **Save**, **Reply**, and **Reply all** check boxes.
    
14. Click **OK** twice.
    
15. On the **Sub-label** blade, click **Save**, and then click **OK**.

16. On the **Azure Information protection** blade, click **Policies > + Add a new policy**.
    
17. Type a name for the new policy in **Policy name** and a description in **Description**.
    
18. Click **Select which users or groups get this policy > User/Groups**, and then select the site members access group for your highly sensitive SharePoint Online team site.
    
19. Click **Select > OK**.

20. Click **Add or remove labels**. In the **Policy: Add or remove labels** pane, click the name of your new sub-label, and then click **OK**.   

21. Click **Save**, and then click **OK**.
 
## Client setup
You are now ready to begin creating documents and protecting them with Azure Information Protection and your new label.
  
You must [install the Azure Information Protection client](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/rms-client/install-client-app) on your device or Windows-based computer. You can script and automate the installation, or users can install the client manually. See the following resources:
  
- [The client side of Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/rms-client/use-client)
    
- [Installing the Azure Information Protection client](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide)
    
- [Download page for manual installation](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018)
    
Once installed, your users run and then sign-in from an Office application (such as Microsoft Word) with their Office 365 account. A new **Information Protection** bar allows users to select the new label. Make sure that your users know the SharePoint Online team site and which label to use, to protect their highly confidential files.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple highly sensitive SharePoint Online team sites, you should create multiple Azure Information Protection scoped policies with sub-labels with the above settings, with the permissions for each sub-label set to the site members access group of a specific SharePoint Online team site. 
  
## Adding permissions for external users
There are two ways you can grant external users access to files protected with Azure Information Protection. In both cases, external users must have an Azure AD account. If external users aren't members of an organization that uses Azure AD, they can obtain an Azure AD account as an individual by using this signup page: [https://aka.ms/aip-signup](https://aka.ms/aip-signup).

 - Add external users to an Azure AD group that is used to configure protection for a label. You'll need to first add the account as a B2B user in your directory. It can take a couple of hours for [group membership caching by Azure Rights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/plan-design/prepare#group-membership-caching-by-azure-information-protection).  
 - Add external users directly to the label protection. You can add all users from an organization (e.g. Fabrikam.com), an Azure AD group (such as a finance group within an organization), or user. For example, you can add an external team of regulators to the protection for a label.
