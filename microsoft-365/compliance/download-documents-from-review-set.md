# Download selected documents from a review set

Download offers a simple way to download content from a review set in native format. The download tool in eDiscovery (Premium) uses the browser's data transfer features. A browser prompt will appear when a download is ready. Files downloaded using this method are zipped in a container file and will contain item-level files. It means that if you select to download an attachment, you will receive the email message with the attachment included. Similarly, if you export an Excel spreadsheet that is embedded in a Word document, the Word document and the embedded Excel spreadsheet are included in the download. When you downloaded items, the Last Modified Data property is preserved and can be viewed as a file property.

To download content from a review set in an eDiscovery (Premium) case, start by selecting the files you want to download then select **Action items** > **Download**.
