Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT)

FACT overview

Copyrighted content comes in many forms—pictures, videos, music, contracts, scripts, workflows, art, architecture, and more—and represents the core assets of many businesses. Piracy threatens to undermine the very existence of these businesses through the unlawful distribution of intellectual property for illicit gain or market disruption. As production and post-production workflows increasingly move to the cloud, the black market for intellectual property is similarly moving away from physical media toward online mechanisms.

Microsoft and Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT)

To underscore Microsoft’s commitment to protect customers when they entrust such assets to the public cloud, Microsoft Azure has been certified by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) in the United Kingdom. FACT certification is based on ISO 27001, focusing on physical and digital security, staff screening and training, and access control. The FACT content protection and security program draws on expertise across law enforcement, technology partners, and industry associations to fight copyright infringement and content theft, such as peer-to-peer sharing, illegal disc duplication, and signal theft.

Based on the voluntary submission by Microsoft to a FACT audit, the FACT auditor certified Azure. Azure was the first multitenant public cloud service to achieve FACT certification, adding to Azure’s portfolio of media-related certifications, including CDSA certification and a formal assessment by the MPAA.

Frequently asked questions

Collapse all

[Why is FACT important?](javascript:void\(0\);)

Content security is critical for feature film and television development, as there are multiple points along the workflow where digital assets can be compromised or stolen. Dailies, rough cuts, and visual effects are just some of the materials exposed during a normal film production cycle, and the box-office impacts of a security breach on a blockbuster project can reach tens of millions of dollars. By passing the FACT audit, Azure provides another layer of assurance to customers by helping to prevent the illegal distribution and sale of motion picture and television assets.

[Does my organization still need to undergo a FACT audit, or can we just use the Azure audit?](javascript:void\(0\);)

Compliance with FACT is voluntary, but Microsoft elected to carry out an independent assessment so that media customers can be confident in the content security and protection capabilities of Azure. However, customers’ individual cloud environments are not managed by Azure, and thus may be subject to additional regulation that is best addressed by an individual audit.
