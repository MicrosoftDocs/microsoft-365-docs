# Get started with Microsoft Purview Chrome Extension

Use these procedures to roll out the Microsoft Purview Chrome Extension.

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Purview Extension is only applicable to Windows devices. The extension is not necessary for the enforcement of data loss prevention on macOS devices.

## Before you begin

To use Microsoft Purview Chrome Extension, the device must be onboarded into endpoint DLP. Review these articles if you are new to DLP or endpoint DLP

### Overall installation workflow

Deploying the extension is a multi-phase process. You can choose to install on one machine at a time, or use Microsoft Endpoint Manager or Group Policy for organization-wide deployments.

1. [Prepare your devices](#prepare-your-devices).
2. [Basic Setup Single Machine Selfhost](#basic-setup-single-machine-selfhost)
3. [Deploy using Microsoft Endpoint Manager](#deploy-using-microsoft-endpoint-manager)
4. [Deploy using Group Policy](#deploy-using-group-policy)
5. [Test the extension](#test-the-extension)
6. [Use the Alerts Management Dashboard to viewing Chrome DLP alerts](#use-the-alerts-management-dashboard-to-viewing-chrome-dlp-alerts)
7. [Viewing Chrome DLP data in activity explorer](#viewing-chrome-dlp-data-in-activity-explorer)

### Prepare infrastructure

If you are rolling out the extension to all your monitored Windows 10/11 devices, you should remove Google Chrome from the unallowed app and unallowed browser lists. For more information, see [Unallowed browsers](dlp-configure-endpoint-settings.md#unallowed-browsers). If you are only rolling it out to a few devices, you can leave Chrome on the unallowed browser or unallowed app lists. The extension will bypass the restrictions of both lists for those computers where it is installed.

### Prepare your devices

1. Use the procedures in these topics to onboard your devices:
    1. [Get started with Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md)
    1. [Onboarding Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices](device-onboarding-overview.md)
    1. [Configure device proxy and internet connection settings for Information Protection](device-onboarding-configure-proxy.md#configure-device-proxy-and-internet-connection-settings-for-information-protection)

### Basic Setup Single Machine Selfhost

This is the recommended method.

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Purview Extension - Chrome Web Store (google.com)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-compliance-exte/echcggldkblhodogklpincgchnpgcdco).

2. Install the extension using the instructions on the Chrome Web Store page.

### Deploy using Microsoft Endpoint Manager

Use this setup method for organization-wide deployments.

#### Microsoft Endpoint Manager Force Install Steps

Before adding the extension to the list of force-installed extensions, it is important to ingest the Chrome ADMX. Steps for this process in Microsoft Endpoint Manager are documented by Google: [Manage Chrome Browser with Microsoft Intune - Google Chrome Enterprise Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9102677?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-ingest-the-chrome-admx-file-into-intune).

 After ingesting the ADMX, the steps below can be followed to create a configuration profile for this extension.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center (https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

2. Navigate to Configuration Profiles.

3. Select **Create Profile**.

4. Select **Windows 10 and later** as the platform.

5. Select **Templates** as the profile type.

6. Select **Custom** as the template name.

7. Select **Create**.

8. Enter a name and optional description on the **Basics** tab and select **Next**.

9. Select **Add** on the **Configuration settings** tab.

10. Enter the following policy information.

    OMA-URI: `./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Chrome~Policy~googlechrome~Extensions/ExtensionInstallForcelist`<br/>
    Data type: `String`<br/>
    Value: `<enabled/><data id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc" value="1&#xF000; echcggldkblhodogklpincgchnpgcdco;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"/>`
    
11. Select **Save** and then select **Next**.

12. Add or edit scope tags on the **Scope tags** tab as needed and select **Next**.

13. Add the required deployment users, devices, and groups on the **Assignments** tab and select **Next**.

14. Add applicability rules on the **Applicability Rules** tab as required and select **Next**.

15. Select **Create**.

### Deploy using Group Policy

#### Adding the Chrome Extension to the ForceInstall List

1. In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to your OU.

2. Expand the following path **Computer/User configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative templates** > **Classic administrative templates** > **Google** > **Google Chrome** > **Extensions**. This path may vary depending on your configuration.

3. Select **Configure the list of force-installed extensions**.

4. Right click and select **Edit**.

5. Select **Enabled**.

6. Select **Show**.

7. Under **Value**, add the following entry: `echcggldkblhodogklpincgchnpgcdco;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`

8. Select **OK** and then **Apply**.

### Test the Extension

#### Upload to cloud service, or access by unallowed browsers Cloud Egress

1. Create or get a sensitive item and, try to upload a file to one of your organization’s restricted service domains. The sensitive data must match one of our built-in [Sensitive Info Types](sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions.md), or one of your organization’s sensitive information types. You should get a DLP toast notification on the device you are testing from that shows that this action is not allowed when the file is open.

#### Testing other DLP scenarios in Chrome

Now that you’ve removed Chrome from the disallowed browsers/apps list, you can test the scenarios below to confirm the behavior meets your organization’s requirements:

- Copy data from a sensitive item to another document using the Clipboard
  - To test, open a file that is protected against copy to clipboard actions in the Chrome browser and attempt to copy data from the file.
  - Expected Result: A DLP toast notification showing that this action is not allowed when the file is open.
- Print a document
  - To test, open a file that is protected against print actions in the Chrome browser and attempt to print the file.
  - Expected Result: A DLP toast notification showing that this action is not allowed when the file is open.
- Copy to USB Removeable Media
  - To test, try to save the file to a removeable media storage.
  - Expected Result: A DLP toast notification showing that this action is not allowed when the file is open.
- Copy to Network Share
  - To test, try to save the file to a network share.
  - Expected Result: A DLP toast notification showing that this action is not allowed when the file is open.

### Use the Alerts Management Dashboard to viewing Chrome DLP alerts

1. Open the **Data loss prevention** page in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a> and select **Alerts**.

2. Refer to the procedures in [How to configure and view alerts for your DLP policies](dlp-configure-view-alerts-policies.md) to view alerts for your Endpoint DLP policies.

### Viewing Chrome DLP data in activity explorer

1. Open the [Data classification page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/dataclassification?viewid=overview) for your domain in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a> and choose **Activity explorer**.

2. Refer to the procedures in [Get started with Activity explorer](data-classification-activity-explorer.md) to access and filter all the data for your Endpoint devices.
