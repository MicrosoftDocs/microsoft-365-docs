# Insider risk management policies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potentially malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

Insider risk management policies determine which users are in-scope and which types of risk indicators are configured for alerts. You can quickly create a security policy that applies to all users in your organization or define individual users or groups for management in a policy. Policies support content priorities to focus policy conditions on multiple or specific Microsoft Teams, SharePoint sites, data sensitivity types, and data labels. Using templates, you can select specific risk indicators and customize event thresholds for policy indicators, effectively customizing risk scores, and level and frequency of alerts. 

You can also configure quick data leak and data theft policies by departing user policies that automatically define policy conditions based on results from the latest analytics. Also, risk score boosters and anomaly detections help identify potentially risky user activity that is of higher importance or unusual. Policy windows allow you to define the time frame to apply the policy to alert activities and are used to determine the duration of the policy once activated.

Check out the [Insider Risk Management Policies Configuration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudK5ajZTUo) for an overview of how policies created with built-in policy templates can help you to quickly act on potential risks.

## Policy dashboard

The **Policy dashboard** allows you to quickly see the policies in your organization, the health of the policy, manually add users to security policies, and to view the status of alerts associated with each policy.

- **Policy name**: Name assigned to the policy in the policy wizard.
- **Status**: Health status for each policy. Displays number of policy warnings and recommendations, or a status of *Healthy* for policies without issues.  You can select the policy to see the health status details for any warnings or recommendations.
- **Active alerts**: Number of active alerts for each policy.
- **Confirmed alerts**: Total number of alerts that resulted in cases from the policy in the last 365 days.
- **Actions taken on alerts**: Total number of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed for the last 365 days.
- **Policy alert effectiveness**: Percentage determined by total confirmed alerts divided by total actions taken on alerts (which is the sum of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed over the past year).

## Policy recommendations from analytics

Insider risk analytics gives you an aggregate view of anonymized user activities related to security and compliance, enabling you to evaluate potential insider risks in your organization without configuring any insider risk policies. This evaluation can help your organization identify potential areas of higher risk and help determine the type and scope of insider risk management policies you may consider configuring. If you decide to act on analytics scan results for [data leaks](#data-leaks) or [data theft](#data-theft-by-departing-users) by departing users policies, you even have the option to configure a quick policy based on these results.

To learn more about insider risk analytics and policy recommendations, see [Insider risk management settings: Analytics](insider-risk-management-settings.md#analytics).

## Quick policies from recommended actions (preview)

For many organizations, getting started with an initial policy can be a challenge. If you're new to insider risk management and are using the recommended actions to get started, you can configure a quick policy to expedite a *General data leaks* or *Data theft by departing users* policy. Quick policy settings are automatically populated based on results from the latest analytics scan in your organization. For example, if the check detected potential data leak activities, the quick policy would include the indicators used to detect those activities. 

To get started, review the quick policy settings and configure the policy with a single selection. If you need to customize a quick policy, you can change the conditions during the initial configuration or after the policy has been created. Also, you can stay up to date with the detection results for a quick policy by configuring email notifications each time you have a policy warning or each time the policy generates a high severity alert.

## Policy templates

Insider risk management templates are pre-defined policy conditions that define the types of risk indicators and risk scoring model used by the policy. Each policy must have a template assigned in the policy creation wizard before the policy is created. Insider risk management supports up to five policies for each policy template. When you create a new insider risk policy with the policy wizard, choose from one of the following policy templates:

### Data theft by departing users

When users leave your organization, there are specific risk indicators typically associated with potential data theft by departing users. This policy template uses exfiltration indicators for risk scoring and focuses on detection and alerts in this risk area. Data theft for departing users may include downloading files from SharePoint Online, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services near their employment resignation and end dates. By using either the Microsoft HR connector or the option to automatically check for user account deletion in Azure Active Directory for your organization, this template starts scoring for risk indicators relating to these activities and how they correlate with user employment status.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using this template, you can configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector to periodically import resignation and termination date information for users in your organization. See the [Import data with the HR connector](import-hr-data.md) article for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector. If you choose not to use the HR connector, you must select the User account deleted from Azure Active Directory option when configuring trigger events in the policy wizard.

### Data leaks

Protecting data and preventing data leaks is a constant challenge for most organizations, particularly with the rapid growth of new data created by users, devices, and services. Users are empowered to create, store, and share information across services and devices that make managing data leaks increasingly more complex and difficult. Data leaks can include accidental oversharing of information outside your organization or data theft with malicious intent. With an assigned Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, built-in, or customizable triggering events, this template starts scoring real-time detections of suspicious SharePoint Online data downloads, file and folder sharing, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services.

When using a *Data leaks* template, you can assign a DLP policy to trigger indicators in the insider risk policy for high severity alerts in your organization. Whenever a high severity alert is generated by a DLP policy rule is added to the Office 365 audit log, insider risk policies created with this template automatically examine the high severity DLP alert. If the alert contains an in-scope user defined in the insider risk policy, the alert is processed by the insider risk policy as a new alert and assigned an insider risk severity and risk score. You can also choose to assign selected indicators as triggering events for a policy. This flexibility and customization helps scope the policy to only the activities covered by the indicators. This policy allows you to evaluate this alert in context with other activities included in the case.

#### Data leaks policy guidelines

When creating or modifying data loss prevention policies for use with insider risk management policies, consider the following guidelines:

- Prioritize data exfiltration events and be selective when assigning **Incident reports** settings to *High* when configuring rules in your DLP policies. For example, emailing sensitive documents to a known competitor should be a *High* alert level exfiltration event. Over-assigning the *High* level in the **Incident reports** settings in other DLP policy rules can increase the noise in the insider risk management alert workflow and make it more difficult for your data investigators and analysts to properly evaluate these alerts. For example, assigning *High* alert levels to access denial activities in DLP policies makes it more challenging to evaluate truly risky user behavior and activities.
- When using a DLP policy as the triggering event, make sure you understand and properly configure the in-scope users in both the DLP and insider risk management policies. Only users defined as in-scope for insider risk management policies using the **Data leaks** template will have high severity DLP policy alerts processed. Additionally, only users defined as in-scope in a rule for a high severity DLP alert will be analyzed by the insider risk management policy for consideration. It's important that you don't unknowingly configure in-scope users in both your DLP and insider risk policies in a conflicting manner.

     For example, if your DLP policy rules are scoped to only users on the Sales Team and the insider risk policy created from the **Data leaks** template has defined all users as in-scope, the insider risk policy will only process high severity DLP alerts for the users on the Sales Team. The insider risk policy won't receive any high priority DLP alerts for users to process that aren't defined in the DLP rules in this example. Conversely, if your insider risk management policy created from **Data leaks** templates is scoped to only users on the Sales Team and the assigned DLP policy is scoped to all users, the insider risk policy will only process high severity DLP alerts for members of the Sales Team. The insider risk management policy will ignore high severity DLP alerts for all users not on the Sales Team.

- Make sure the **Incident reports** rule setting in the DLP policy used for this insider risk management template is configured for *High* severity level alerts. The *High* severity level is the triggering events and insider risk management alerts won't be generated from rules in DLP policies with the **Incident reports** field set at *Low* or *Medium*.

    ![DLP policy alert setting.](../media/insider-risk-DLP-policy-high-severity.png)

     > [!NOTE]
     > When creating a new DLP policy using the built-in templates, you'll need to select the **Create or customize advanced DLP rules** option to configure the **Incident reports** setting for the *High* severity level.

Each insider risk management policy created from the **Data leaks** template can only have one DLP policy assigned when using this triggering event option. Consider creating a dedicated DLP policy that combines the different activities you want to detect and act as triggering events for  insider risk policies that use the **Data leaks** template.

See the [Create, test, and tune a DLP policy](create-test-tune-dlp-policy.md) article for step-by-step guidance to configure DLP policies for your organization.

### Data leaks by priority users (preview)

Protecting data and preventing data leaks for users in your organization may depend on their position, level of access to sensitive information, or risk history. Data leaks can include accidental oversharing of highly sensitive information outside your organization or data theft with malicious intent. With an assigned data loss prevention (DLP) policy as a triggering event option, this template starts scoring real-time detections of suspicious activity and result in an increased likelihood of insider risk alerts and alerts with higher severity levels. Priority users are defined in [priority user groups](insider-risk-management-settings.md#priority-user-groups) configured in the insider risk management settings area.

As with the **Data leaks template**, you can choose a DLP policy to trigger indicators in the insider risk policy for high severity alerts in your organization. Follow the Data leaks policy guidelines for DLP policies when creating a policy with the DLP option when using this template. You can also choose to assign selected indicators as triggering events for a policy. This flexibility and customization help scope the policy to only the activities covered by the indicators. Additionally, you'll need to assign priority user groups created in **Insider risk management** > **Settings** > **Priority user groups** to the policy.

### Data leaks by risky users (preview)

When users experience employment stressors, they may become risky users, which may increase the chances of insider risk activity. This template starts scoring user activity when an indicator associated with risky user is identified. Examples may include performance improvement notifications, poor performance reviews, changes to job level status, or email and other messages that may signal risk activities. Data leaks for risky users may include downloading files from SharePoint Online and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services.

When using this template, you must either configure a HR connector, select the option to [integrate communication compliance risk signals](/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance-policies#policy-for-insider-risk-management-integration-preview) from user messages, or choose both. The HR connector enables the periodic import of performance improvement notifications, poor performance review statuses, or job level change information for users in your organization. Communication compliance risk integration imports signals for user messages that may contain potentially threatening, harassing, or discriminatory text content. Associated alerts generated in Communication Compliance do not need to be triaged, remediated, or changed in status to be integrated with the insider risk management policy.

To configure a HR connector, see the [Import data with the HR connector](import-hr-data.md) article. To configure integration with communication compliance, you'll select this option in the wizard when you configure the policy.

### Security policy violations (preview)

In many organizations, users have permission to install software on their devices or to modify device settings to help with their tasks. Either inadvertently or with malicious intent, users may install malware or disable important security features that help protect information on their device or on your network resources. This policy template uses security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to start scoring these activities and focus detection and alerts to this risk area. Use this template to provide insights for security policy violations in scenarios when users may have a history of security policy violations that may be an indicator of insider risk.

You'll need to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configured in your organization and enable Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration in the Defender Security Center to import security violation alerts. For more information on configuring Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center).

### Patient data misuse (preview)

Protecting healthcare record data and preventing the misuse of patient personal data is a significant concern for organizations in the healthcare industry. This misuse may include confidential data leaks to unauthorized persons, fraudulent modification of patient records, or the theft of patient healthcare records. Preventing this misuse of patient data, either by lack of awareness, negligence, or fraud by users is also key component in meeting the regulatory requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Both of these acts establish the requirements for safeguarding patient protected health information (PHI).

This policy template enables risk scoring for internal users that detects suspicious activities associated with records hosted on existing electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Detection focuses on unauthorized access, viewing, modification, and export of patient data. You'll need to configure a connector the [Microsoft Healthcare connector](import-healthcare-data.md) or [Epic connector](import-epic-data.md) to support detection of access, exfiltration, or obfuscation activities in your EMR system.

When using this template, you must also configure a Microsoft HR connector to periodically import organization profile data for users in your organization. See the [Set up a connector to import HR data](/microsoft-365/compliance/import-hr-data) article for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector.

### Risky browser usage (preview)

Identifying user visitation to potentially inappropriate or unacceptable web sites on organization devices and networks is an important part of minimizing security, legal, and regulatory risks. Users that inadvertently or purposefully visit these types of websites may expose the organization to legal actions from other users, violate regulatory requirements, elevate network security risks, or jeopardize current and future business operations and opportunities. This misuse is often defined in an organization's acceptable use policy for user devices and organization network resources but is often difficult to quickly identify and act upon.

To help protect against these risks, this policy can help detect and enable risk scoring for web browsing that might be in violation of your organization's acceptable use policy, such as visiting sites that pose a threat (for example phishing sites) or contain adult content. Several types of categories are available for automatic categorization of web browsing activities by in-scope users.

When using this policy template, you'll need several prerequisites. For more information, see [Learn about and configure insider risk management browser signal detection](/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management-browser-support).

### Security policy violations by departing users (preview)

Departing users, whether leaving on positive or negative terms, may be higher risks for security policy violations. To help protect against inadvertent or malicious security violations for departing users, this policy template uses Defender for Endpoint alerts to provide insights into security-related activities. These activities include the user installing malware or other potentially harmful applications and disabling security features on their devices. By using either the [Microsoft HR connector](import-hr-data.md) or the option to automatically check for user account deletion in Azure Active Directory for your organization, this template starts scoring for risk indicators relating to these security activities and how they correlate with user employment status.

You'll need to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configured in your organization and enable Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration in the Defenfder Security Center to import security violation alerts. For more information on configuring Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center).

### Security policy violations by priority users (preview)

Protecting against security violations for users in your organization may depend on their position, level of access to sensitive information, or risk history. Because security violations by priority users may have a significant impact on your organization's critical areas, this policy template starts scoring on these indicators, and uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts to provide insights into security-related activities for these users. These activities may include the priority users installing malware or other potentially harmful applications and disabling security features on their devices. Priority users are defined in priority user groups configured in the insider risk management settings area.

You'll need to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configured in your organization and enable Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration in the Defender Security Center to import security violation alerts. For more information on configuring Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center). Additionally, you'll need to assign priority user groups created in **Insider risk management** > **Settings** > **Priority user groups** to the policy.

### Security policy violations by risky users (preview)

Users that experience employment stressors may be at a higher risk for inadvertent or malicious security policy violations. These stressors may result in behaviors that result in the user being placed on a performance improvement plan, a poor performance review status, being demoted from their current position, or the user sending email and other messages that may signal risky behavior. This policy template starts risk scoring based on these indicators and activities associated with these events for these users.

When using this template, you must configure a HR connector, or select the option to [integrate communication compliance risk signals](/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance-policies#policy-for-insider-risk-management-integration-preview) from user messages, or both. The HR connector enables the periodic import of performance improvement notifications, poor performance review statuses, or job level change information for users in your organization. Communication compliance risk integration imports signals for user messages that may contain potentially threatening, harassing, or discriminatory text content. Associated alerts generated in communication compliance do not need to be triaged, remediated, or changed in status to be integrated with the insider risk management policy. To configure a HR connector, see the [Import data with the HR connector](import-hr-data.md) article. To configure integration with communication compliance, you'll select this option in wizard when you configure the policy.

You'll also need to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configured in your organization and enable Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration in the Defender Security Center to import security violation alerts. For more information on configuring Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center).

### Policy template prerequisites and triggering events

Depending on the template you choose for an insider risk management policy, the triggering events and policy prerequisites vary. Triggering events are prerequisites that determine if a user is active for an insider risk management policy. If a user is added to an insider risk management policy but doesn't have a triggering event, the user activity isn't evaluated by the policy unless they're manually added in the Users dashboard. Policy prerequisites are required items so that the policy receives the signals or activities necessary to evaluate risk.

The following table lists the triggering events and prerequisites for policies created from each insider risk management policy template:

| **Policy template** | **Triggering events for policies** | **Prerequisites** |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Data theft by departing users** | Resignation or termination date indicator from HR connector or Azure Active Directory account deletion | (optional) Microsoft 365 HR connector configured for termination and resignation date indicators |

| **Security policy violations by risky users** | - Performance improvement, poor performance, or job level change indicators from HR connector. <br> - Messages containing potentially threatening, harassing, or discriminatory language | Microsoft 365 HR connector configured for risk indicators <br><br> AND/OR <br><br> Communication Compliance integration and dedicated risky user policy <br><br> AND <br><br> Active Microsoft Defender for Endpoint subscription <br><br> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration with Microsoft Purview compliance portal configured |

## Prioritize content in policies

Insider risk management policies support specifying a higher priority for content depending on where it's stored, the type of content, or how it's classified. You can also choose whether to assign risk scores to all activities detected by a policy or only activities that include priority content. Specifying content as a priority increases the risk score for any associated activity, which in turn increases the chance of generating a high severity alert. However, some activities won't generate an alert at all unless the related content contains built-in or custom sensitive info types or was specified as a priority in the policy.

For example, your organization has a dedicated SharePoint site for a highly confidential project. Data leaks for information in this SharePoint site could compromise the project and would have a significant impact on its success. By prioritizing this SharePoint site in a Data leaks policy, risk scores for qualifying activities are automatically increased. This prioritization increases the likelihood that these activities generate an insider risk alert and raises the severity level for the alert.

Additionally, you can choose to focus this policy for SharePoint site activity that only includes priority content for this project. Risk scores will be assigned and alerts will be generated only when specified activities include priority content. Activities without priority content won't be scored, but you'll still be able to review them if an alert is generated.

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure a policy to generate alerts only for activity that includes priority content, no changes are applied to risk score boosters.

When you create an insider risk management policy in the policy wizard, you can choose from the following priorities:

- **SharePoint sites**: Any activity associated with all file types in defined SharePoint sites is assigned a higher risk score. Users configuring the policy and selecting priority SharePoint sites can select SharePoint sites that they have permission to access. If SharePoint sites aren't available for selection in the policy by the current user, another user with the required permissions can select the sites for the policy later, or the current user should be given access to the required sites.
- **Sensitive information types**: Any activity associated with content that contains [sensitive information types](sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions.md) are assigned a higher risk score.
- **Sensitivity labels**: Any activity associated with content that has specific [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) applied are assigned a higher risk score.
- **File extensions**: Any activity associated with content that has specific file extensions. Users configuring a data theft/leak policy that select **File extensions to prioritize** in the policy wizard can define up to 50 file extensions to prioritize in the policy. Entered extensions can include or omit a '.' as the first character of the prioritized extension.
- **Trainable classifiers**: Any activity associated with content that is included in a [trainable classifier](/microsoft-365/compliance/classifier-learn-about). Users configuring a policy that select Trainable classifiers in the policy wizard can select up to 5 trainable classifiers to apply to the policy. These classifiers can be existing classifiers that identify patterns of sensitive information like social security, credit card, or bank account numbers or custom classifiers created in your organization.

## Sequence detection (preview)

Risk management activities may not occur as isolated events. These risks are frequently part of a larger sequence of events. A sequence is a group of two or more potentially risky activities performed one after the other that might suggest an elevated risk. Identifying these related user activities is an important part of evaluating overall risk. When sequence detection is selected for data theft or data leaks policies, insights from sequence information activities are displayed on the **User activity** tab within an insider risk management case. The following policy templates support sequence detection:

- Data theft by departing users
- Data leaks
- Data leaks by priority users
- Data leaks by risky users

These insider risk management policies can use specific indicators and the order that they occur to detect each step in a sequence of risk. For policies created from the *Data leaks* and *Data leaks by priority user* templates, you can also select which sequences trigger the policy. File names are used when mapping activities across a sequence. These risks are organized into four main categories of activity:

- **Collection**: Detects download activities by in-scope policy users. Example risk management activities include downloading files from SharePoint sites or moving files into a compressed folder.
- **Exfiltration**: Detects sharing or extraction activities to internal and external sources by in-scope policy users. An example risk management activity includes sending emails with attachments from your organization to external recipients.
- **Obfuscation**: Detects the masking of potentially risky activities by in-scope policy users. An example risk management activities include renaming files on a device.
- **Clean-up**: Detects deletion activities by in-scope policy users. An example risk management activity includes deleting files from a device.

> [!NOTE]
> Sequence detection uses indicators that are enabled in the global settings for insider risk management. If appropriate indicators are not selected, you'll be able to turn on these indicators in the sequence detection step in the policy wizard.

You can customize individual threshold settings for each sequence detection type when configured in the policy. These threshold settings adjust alerts based on the volume of files associated with the sequence type.

To learn more about sequence detection management in the **User activity** view, see [Insider risk management cases: User activity](insider-risk-management-cases.md#user-activity).

## Cumulative exfiltration detection (preview)

With privacy on by default, insider risk indicators help identify unusual levels of risk activities when evaluated daily for users that are in-scope for insider risk policies. Cumulative exfiltration detection uses machine learning models to help you identify when exfiltration activities that a user performs over a certain time exceeds the normal amount performed by users in your organization for the past 30 days over multiple exfiltration activity types. For example, if a user shared more files than most users over the past month, this activity would be detected and classified as a cumulative exfiltration activity.

Insider risk management analysts and investigators may use cumulative exfiltration detection insights to help identify exfiltration activities that may not typically generate [alerts](insider-risk-management-activities.md#alert-dashboard) but are above what is typical for their organization. Some examples may be departing users slowly exfiltrate data across a range of days, or when users repeatedly share data across multiple channels more than usual for data sharing for your organization, or compared to their peer groups.
>[!NOTE]
> By default, cumulative exfiltration detection generates risk scores based on a user's cumulative exfiltration activity compared to their organization norms. You can enable *Cumulative exfiltration detection* options in the **Policy indicators** section of the Insider risk management settings page.
Higher risk scores are assigned to cumulative exfiltration activities for SharePoint sites, sensitive information types, and content with [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels#label-priority-order-matters) configured as priority content in a policy or for activity involving labels configured as high priority in [Microsoft Purview Information Protection](information-protection.md).

Cumulative exfiltration detection is enabled by default when using the following policy templates:

- Data theft by departing users
- Data leaks
- Data leaks by priority users
- Data leaks by risky users

### Peer groups for cumulative exfiltration detection

Insider risk management identifies three types of peer groups for analyzing exfiltration activity performed by users. Peer groups defined for users are based on the following criteria:

**SharePoint sites**: Insider risk management identifies peer groups based on users who access similar SharePoint sites. 

**Similar organization**: Users with reports and team members based on organization hierarchy. This option requires that your organization uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to maintain organization hierarchy. 

**Similar job title**: Users with a combination of organizational distance and similar job titles. For example, a user with a Senior Sales Manager title with a similar role designation as a Lead Sales Manager in the same organization would be identified as similar job title. This option requires that your organization uses Azure AD to maintain organization hierarchy, role designations, and job titles. If you do not have Azure AD configured for organization structure and job titles, then insider risk management identifies peer groups based on common SharePoint sites.
 
If you enable cumulative exfiltration detection, your organization is agreeing to sharing Azure AD data with the compliance portal, including organization hierarchy and job titles. If your organization does not use Azure AD to maintain this information, then detection may be less accurate.
> [!NOTE]
> Cumulative exfiltration detection uses exfiltration indicators that are enabled in the global settings for insider risk management and exfiltration indicators that are selected in a policy. As such, cumulative exfiltration detection is only evaluated for the necessary exfiltration indicators selected. Cumulative exfiltration activities for [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) configured in priority content generate higher risk scores.

When cumulative exfiltration detection is enabled for data theft or data leak policies, insights from cumulative exfiltration activities are displayed on the **User activity** tab within an insider risk management case. To learn more about user activity management, see [Insider risk management cases: User activities](insider-risk-management-cases.md#user-activity). 

## Policy health

The policy health status gives you insights into potential issues with your insider risk management policies. The **Status** column on the **Policies** tab can alert you to policies issues that may prevent user activity from being reported or why the number of activity alerts is unusual. The policy health status can also confirm that the policy is healthy and doesn't need attention or configuration changes.

If there are issues with a policy, the policy health status displays notification warnings and recommendations to help you take action to resolve policy issues. These notifications can help you resolve the following issues:

- **Policies with incomplete configuration**. These issues may include missing users or groups in the policy or other incomplete policy configuration steps.
- **Policies with indicator configuration issues**. Indicators are an important part of each policy. If indicators aren't configured, or if too few indicators are selected, the policy may not evaluate risky activities as expected.
- **Policy triggers aren't working, or policy trigger requirements aren't properly configured**. Policy functionality may depend on other services or configuration requirements to effectively detect triggering events to activate risk score assignment to users in the policy. These dependencies may include issues with connector configuration, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert sharing, or data loss prevention policy configuration settings.
- **Volume limits are nearing or over limits**. Insider risk management policies use numerous Microsoft 365 services and endpoints to aggregate risk activity signals. Depending on the number of users in your policies, volume limits may delay identification and reporting of risk activities. Learn more about these limits in the Policy template limits section of this article.

To quickly view the health status for a policy, navigate the **Policy** tab and the **Status** column. Here you'll see the following policy health status options for each policy:

- *Healthy*: No issues have been identified with the policy.
- *Recommendations*: An issue with the policy that may prevent the policy from operating as expected.
- *Warnings*: An issue with the policy that may prevent it from identifying potentially risky activities.

For more details about any recommendations or warnings, select a policy on the **Policy** tab to open the policy details card.

## Policy template limits

Insider risk management policy templates use limits to manage the volume and rate of processing for in-scope user risk activities and how this process is integrated with supporting Microsoft 365 services. Each policy template has a maximum number of users that can be actively assigned risk scores for the policy that it can support and effectively process and report potentially risky activities. In-scope users are users with triggering events for the policy.

The limit for each policy is calculated based on the total number of unique users receiving risk scores per policy template type. If the number of users for a policy template type is near or exceeds the user limit, the policy performance will be reduced. To view the current number of users for a policy, navigate to the Policy tab and the Users in scope column. You may have up to five policies for any policy template. These maximum limits apply to users across all policies using a given policy template.

Use the following table to determine the maximum number of in-scope users supported for each policy template:

|**Policy template**|**Current in-scope user maximum**|
|:------------------|:--------------------------------|
|General data leak|15,000|
|Data leak by risky users|7,500|
|Data leak by priority users|1,000|
|Data theft by departing users|20,000|
|Security policy violations|1,000|
|Patient data misuse|5,000|
|Risky browser usage|7,000|
|Security policy violation by priority users|1,000|
|Security policy violations by departing users|15,000|
|Security policy violations by risky users|7,500|
|Forensic evidence|5 users for preview release|

## Create a new policy

To create a new insider risk management policy, you'll generally use the policy wizard in the **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. You can also create quick policies for general data leaks and data theft by departing users from Analytics checks if applicable.

Complete the following steps to create a new policy using the policy wizard:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Policies** tab.
2. Select **Create policy** to open the policy wizard.
3. On the **Policy template** page, choose a policy category and then select the template for the new policy. These templates are made up of conditions and indicators that define the risk activities you want to detect and investigate. Review the template prerequisites, triggering events, and detected activities to confirm this policy template fits your needs.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Some policy templates have prerequisites that must be configured for the policy to generate relevant alerts. If you haven't configured the applicable policy prerequisites, see **Step 4** in the [Get started with insider risk management](/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management-configure).

4. Select **Next** to continue.
5. On the **Name and description** page, complete the following fields:
    - **Name (required)**: Enter a friendly name for the policy. This name can't be changed after the policy is created.
    - **Description (optional)**: Enter a description for the policy.

6. Select **Next** to continue.
7. On the **Users and groups** page, select **Include all users and groups** or **Include specific users and groups** to define which users or groups are included in the policy, or if you've chosen a priority users-based template; select **Add or edit priority user groups**. Selecting **Include all users and groups** will look for triggering events for all users and groups in your organization to start assigning risk scores for the policy. Selecting **Include specific users and groups** allows you to define which users and groups to assign to the policy. Guest user accounts aren't supported.
8. Select **Next** to continue.
9. On the **Content to prioritize** page, you can assign (if needed) the sources to prioritize, which increases the chance of generating a high severity alert for these sources. Select one of the following choices:

    - **I want to prioritize content**. Selecting this option will enable you to prioritize *SharePoint sites*, *Sensitivity labels*, *Sensitive info types*, and *File extensions* content types. If you choose this option, you must select at least one priority content type.
    - **I don't want to specify priority content right now**. Selecting this option will skip the priority content detail pages in the wizard.

10. Select **Next** to continue.

11. If you've selected **I want to prioritize content** in the previous step, you'll see the detail pages for *SharePoint sites*, *sensitive info types*, *sensitivity labels*, *file extensions*, and *Scoring*. Use these detail pages to define the SharePoint, sensitive info types, sensitivity labels, and file extensions to prioritize in the policy. The *Scoring* detail page allows you to scope the policy to only assign risk scores to priority content.

    - **SharePoint sites**: Select **Add SharePoint site** and select the SharePoint sites you have access to and want to prioritize. For example, *"group1@contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/group1"*.
    - **Sensitive info type**: Select **Add sensitive info type** and select the sensitivity types you want to prioritize. For example, *"U.S. Bank Account Number"* and *"Credit Card Number"*.
    - **Sensitivity labels**: Select **Add sensitivity label** and select the labels you want to prioritize. For example, *"Confidential"* and *"Secret"*.
    - **File extensions**: Add up to 50 file extensions. You can include or omit the '.' with the file extension. For example, *.py* or *py* would prioritize Python files.
    - **Scoring**: Decide whether to assign risk scores to all activities detected by this policy or only for activities that include priority content. Choose **Get alerts for all activity** or **Get alerts only for activity that includes priority content**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users configuring the policy and determining priority SharePoint sites can select SharePoint sites that they have permission to access. If SharePoint sites aren't available for selection in the policy by the current user, another user with the required permissions can select the sites for the policy later or the current user should be given access to the required sites.

12. Select **Next** to continue.
13. If you've selected the *Data leaks* or *Data leaks by priority users* templates, you'll see options on the **Triggers for this policy** page for custom triggering events and policy indicators. You have the choice to select a DLP policy or indicators for triggering events that bring users assigned to the policy in-scope for activity scoring. If you select the **User matches a data loss prevention (DLP) policy triggering event** option, you must select a DLP policy from the DLP policy dropdown list to enable triggering indicators for the DLP Policy for this insider risk management policy. If you select the **User performs an exfiltration activity triggering event** option, you must select one or more of the listed indicators for the policy triggering event.
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you're unable to select a listed indicator, it's because they aren't enabled for your organization. To make them available to select and assign to the policy, enable the indicators in **Insider risk management** > **Settings** > **Policy indicators**.

    If you've selected other policy templates, custom triggering events aren't supported. The built-in policy triggering events apply and you'll continue to Step 23 without defining policy attributes.

14. If you've selected the *Data leaks by risky users* or *Security policy violations by risky users* templates, you'll see options on the **Triggers for this policy** page for integration with communication compliance and HR data connector events. You have the choice to assign risk scores when users send messages that contain potentially threatening, harassing, or discriminatory language or to bring users into the the policy scope after risky user events are reported in your HR system. If you select the **Risk triggers from communication compliance (preview)** option, you can accept the default communication compliance policy (automatically created), choose a previously created policy scope for this trigger, or create another scoped policy. If you select **HR data connector events**, you must configure a HR data connector for your organization.
15. Select **Next** to continue.
16. If you've selected the *Data leaks* or *Data leaks by priority users* templates and have selected the **User performs an exfiltration activity and associated indicators**, you can choose custom or default thresholds for the indicator triggering events that you've selected. Choose either the **Use default thresholds (Recommended)** or **Use custom thresholds for the triggering events**.
17. Select **Next** to continue.
18. If you've selected **Use custom thresholds for the triggering events**, for each triggering event indicator that you selected in Step 13, choose the appropriate level to generate the desired level of activity alerts.
19. Select **Next** to continue.
20. On the **Policy indicators** page, you'll see the [indicators](insider-risk-management-settings.md#indicators) that you've defined as available on the **Insider risk settings** > **Indicators** page. Select the indicators you want to apply to the policy.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If indicators on this page can't be selected, you'll need to select the indicators you want to enable for all policies. You can use the **Turn on indicators** button in the wizard or select indicators on the **Insider risk management** > **Settings** > **Policy indicators** page.

    If you've selected at least one *Office* or *Device* indicator, select the **Risk score boosters** as appropriate. Risk score boosters are only applicable for selected indicators.
    If you've selected a *Data theft* or *Data leaks* policy template, select one or more **Sequence detection** methods and a **Cumulative exfiltration detection** method to apply to the policy.
    If you've selected the *Risky browser usage* policy template, select one or more of the **Browsing indicators**.

21. Select **Next** to continue.
22. On the **Decide whether to use default or custom indicator thresholds** page, choose custom or default thresholds for the policy indicators that you've selected. Choose either the **Use default thresholds for all indicators** or **Specify custom thresholds** for the selected policy indicators. If you've selected Specify custom thresholds, choose the appropriate level to generate the desired level of activity alerts for each policy indicator.
23. Select **Next** to continue.
24. On the **Review** page, review the settings you've chosen for the policy and any suggestions or warnings for your selections. Select **Edit** to change any of the policy values or select **Submit** to create and activate the policy.

## Copy a policy

You may need to create a new policy that is similar to an existing policy but needs just a few configuration changes. Instead of creating a new policy from scratch, you can copy an existing policy and then modify the areas that need to be updated in the new policy.

Complete the following steps to copy an existing policy:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Policies** tab.
2. On the policy dashboard, select the policy you want to copy.
3. On the policy details page, select Copy.
4. In the policy wizard, name the new policy and update the policy configuration as needed.

## Immediately start scoring security-related user activity

There may be scenarios where you need to immediately start assigning risk scores to users with insider risk policies outside of the insider risk management triggering event workflow. Use **Start scoring activity for users** on the **Policies** tab to manually add a user (or users) to one or more insider risk policies for a specific amount of time, to immediately start assigning risk scores to their activity, and to bypass the requirement for a user to have a triggering indicator (like a DLP policy match). You can also add a reason for adding the user to the policy, which will appear on the users' activity timeline. Users manually added to policies are displayed in the **Users** dashboard and alerts are created if activity meets the policy alert thresholds. You can add up to 4,000 users per policy when adding users for immediate scoring.

Some scenarios where you may want to immediately start scoring user activities:

- When users are identified with risk concerns and you want to immediately start assigning risk scores to their activity for one or more of your policies.
- When there's an incident that may require you to immediately start assigning risk scores to involved users' activity for one or more of your policies.
- When you haven't configured your HR connector yet, but you want to start assigning risk scores to user activities for HR events by uploading a .csv file for the users.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take several hours for new manually-added users to appear in the **Users** dashboard. Activities for the previous 90 days for these users may take up to 24 hours to display. To view activities for manually added users, navigate to the **Users** tab and select the user on the **Users** dashboard and open the **User activity** tab on the details pane.

To manually start scoring activity for users in one or more insider risk management policies, complete the following steps:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Policies** tab.
2. On the policy dashboard, select the policy or policies you want to add users to.
3. Select **Start scoring activity for users**.
4. In the **Reason field** in the **Add users to multiple policies** pane, add a reason for adding the users.
5. In the **This should last for (choose between 5 and 30 days)** field, define the number of days to score the user's activity for the policy they're added to
6. To search your Active Directory for users, use the **Search user to add to policies** field. Type the name of the user you want to add to the policies. Select the user name and repeat to assign additional users to the policies. The list of users you've selected appear in the users section of the Add users to multiple policies pane.
7. To import a list of users to add to the policies, select **Import** to import a .csv (comma-separated values) file. The file must be in the following format and you must list the user principal names in the file:

    ```csv
    user principal name
    user1@domain.com
    user2@domain.com
    ```

8. Select the Add users to policies to accept the changes and add users to the policies or select Cancel to discard the changes and close the dialog.

## Stop scoring users in a policy

To stop scoring users in a policy, see the [Insider risk management users: Remove users from in-scope assignment to policies](insider-risk-management-users.md#remove-users-from-in-scope-assignment-to-policies) article.

## Delete a policy

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a policy does not delete active or archived alerts generated from the policy.

To delete an existing insider risk management policy, complete the following steps:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Policies** tab.
2. On the policy dashboard, select the policy you want to delete.
3. Select **Delete** on the dashboard toolbar.
4. On the **Delete** dialog, Select **Yes** to delete the policy, or select **Cancel** to close the dialog.
