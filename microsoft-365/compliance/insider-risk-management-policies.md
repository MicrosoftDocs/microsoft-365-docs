# Insider risk management policies

Insider risk management policies determine which employees are in-scope and which types of risk indicators are configured for alerts. You can quickly create a policy that applies to all users in your organization, or define individual users or groups for management in a policy. Policies support content priorities to focus policy conditions on multiple or specific Microsoft Teams, SharePoint sites, data sensitivity types, and data labels. Using templates, they include specific risk indicators and how much weight they are assigned within a policy, effectively determining the weight of each alert trigger in the policy. Policies windows allow you to define the time frame to apply the policy to alert activities and are used to determine the duration of the policy once activated. The maximum policy limit is five active policies at the same time. However, you can configure additional policies and activate and deactivate policies as needed.

## Policy dashboard

The **Policy dashboard** allows you to quickly see the policies in your organization and the current status of alerts associated with each policy.

- **Policy name**: The name assigned to the policy in the policy wizard.
- **Active alerts**: The number of active alerts for each policy.
- **Confirmed alerts**: The total number of alerts the resulted in cases from the policy in the last 365 days.
- **Actions taken on alerts**: The total number of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed for the last 365 days.
- **Policy effectiveness**: The percentage determined by total confirmed alerts divided by total actions taken on alerts (which is the sum of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed over the past year).
- **Active**: The status of the case, either *Yes* or *No*.

## Policy templates

Insider risk management templates are pre-defined policy conditions that define the types of risk indicators monitored by a policy. Each policy must have a template assigned in the policy creation wizard before the policy is created. When you create a new insider risk policy, you'll choose from one of the following templates.

### Departing employee data theft

When employees leave your organization, there are specific risk indicators typically associated with data theft by departing employees. This policy template prioritizes these indicators and focuses detection and alerts to this risk area. Data theft for departing employees may include downloading files from SharePoint Online, copying files to portable devices such as USB drives, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services near their employment resignation and end dates. This template prioritizes risk indicators relating to these activities and how they correlate with employee employment status.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When using this template, you must configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector to periodically import resignation and termination date information for employees in your organization. See the [Import data with the HR Connector](import-hr-data.md) topic for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR Connector for your organization.

### Data leaks

Protecting data and preventing data leaks is a constant challenge for most organizations, particularly with the rapid grow of new data created by employees, devices, and services. Employees are empowered to create, store, and share information across services and devices that make managing data leaks increasingly more complex and difficult. Data leaks can include accidental oversharing of information outside your organization or data theft with malicious intent. In conjunction with an assigned Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, this template prioritizes real-time detection of suspicious SharePoint Online data downloads, file and folder sharing, copying files to portable devices such as USB drives, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services.

When using **Data leaks** template, you must assign a DLP policy to trigger indicators in the insider risk policy for high severity alerts in your organization. Whenever a high severity alert is generated by a DLP policy rule is added to the Office 365 audit log, insider risk policies created with this template automatically examine the high severity DLP alert. If the alert contains an in-scope user defined in the insider risk policy, the alert will be processed by the insider risk policy as a new alert and assigned an insider risk severity and risk score. This alert can be evaluated as part of the insider risk management workflow and added to an insider risk management case if needed.

When creating or modifying DLP policies for use with insider risk management policies, consider the following guidelines:

- Prioritize data exfiltration events and be selective when assigning **Incident reports** settings to *High* when configuring rules in your DLP policies. For example, emailing sensitive documents to a known competitor should be a *High* alert level exfiltration event. Over-assigning the *High* level in the **Incident reports** settings in other DLP policy rules can increase the noise in the insider risk management alert workflow and make it more difficult for your data investigators and analysts to properly evaluate these alerts. For example, assigning *High* alert levels to blocking activities in DLP policies makes it more challenging to evaluate truly risky user behavior and activities.
- Make sure you understand and properly configure the in-scope users in both the DLP and insider risk management policies. Only users defined as in-scope for insider risk management policies using the **Data leaks** template will have high severity DLP policy alerts processed. Additionally, only users defined as in-scope in a rule for a high severity DLP alert will be examined by the insider risk management policy for consideration. It is important that you don’t unknowingly configure in-scope users in both your DLP and insider risk policies in a conflicting manner.

     For example, if your DLP policy rules are scoped to only users on the Sales Team and the insider risk policy created from the **Data leaks** template has defined all users as in-scope, the insider risk policy will only actually process high severity DLP alerts for the users on the Sales Team. The insider risk policy won’t receive any high priority DLP alerts for users to process that aren’t defined in the DLP rules in this example. Conversely, if your insider risk management policy created from the **Data leaks** template is scoped to only users on the Sales Team and the assigned DLP policy is scoped to all users, the insider risk policy will only process high severity DLP alerts for members of the Sales Team. The insider risk management policy will ignore high severity DLP alerts for all users not on the Sales Team.

- Make sure the **Incident reports** rule setting in the DLP policy used for this insider risk management template is configured for *High* severity level alerts. The *High* severity level is the triggering indicator and insider risk management alerts won't be generated from rules in DLP policies with the **Incident reports** field set at *Low* or *Medium*.

    ![DLP policy alert setting](../media/insider-risk-DLP-policy-high-severity.png)

     >[!NOTE]
     >When creating a new DLP policy using the built-in templates, you’ll need to select the **Create or customize advanced DLP rules** option to configure the **Incident reports** setting for the *High* severity level.

Each insider risk management policy created from the **Data leaks** template can only have one DLP policy assigned. Consider creating a dedicated DLP policy that combines the different activities you want to detect and act as triggering indicators for  insider risk policies that use the **Data leaks** template.

See the [Create, test, and tune a DLP policy](create-test-tune-dlp-policy.md) topic for step-by-step guidance to configure DLP policies for your organization.

### Offensive language in email

Detecting and taking action to prevent offensive and abusive behavior is a critical component of preventing risk. Built-in offensive language classifiers in Microsoft 365 can scan sent email messages from Exchange Online mailboxes in your organization for different types of compliance issues. These classifiers use a combination of artificial intelligence and keywords to identify language in email likely to violate anti-harassment policies. Use this template to quickly create a policy that uses these classifiers to automatically detect email message content that may be considered abusive or offensive. Insider risk management uses classifiers that scan sent email messages for English language terms and sentiment for offensive language.

## Policy settings

Insider risk settings apply to all insider risk management policies, regardless of the template you chose when creating a policy. Settings are configured using the **Insider risk settings** control located at the top of all insider risk management tabs. These settings control privacy, indicators, monitoring windows, and intelligent detections.

### Privacy

Protecting the privacy of users that have policy matches is important and can help promote objectivity in data investigation and analysis reviews for insider risk alerts. For users with an insider risk policy match, you can choose one of the following settings:

- **Show anonymized versions of usernames**: User names are anonymized to prevent admins, data investigators, and reviewers from seeing who is associated with policy alerts. For example, a user 'Grace Taylor' would appear with a randomized pseudonym such as 'AnonIS8-988' in all areas of the insider risk management experience. Choosing this setting anonymizes all users with current and past policy matches and applies to all policies. User profile information in the insider risk alert and case details will not be available when this option is chosen. However, usernames are displayed when adding new users to existing policies or when assigning users to new policies. If you choose to turn off this setting, usernames will be displayed for all users that have current or past policy matches.
- **Do not show anonymized versions of usernames**: Usernames are displayed for all current and past policy matches for alerts and cases. User profile information (the name, title, alias, and organization or department) is displayed for the user for all insider risk management alerts and cases.

### Indicators

Insider risk policy templates define the type of risk activities that you want to detect and investigate. Each policy template is based on specific indicators that correspond to specific triggers and risk activities. All indicators are disabled by default, and you must select one or more policy indicators before configuring an insider risk management policy. 

Alerts are triggered by policies when users perform activities related to policy indicators that meet a required threshold. Insider risk management uses two types of indicators:

- **Triggering indicators**: Indicators that determine if a user is active for an insider risk management policy. If a user is added to an insider risk management policy that uses triggering indicators but does not have a triggering indicator activity, the user activity is not evaluated by the policy. For example, User A is added to a policy created from the *Departing employee data theft* policy template and the policy and HR connector are properly configured. Until User A has a termination date reported by the HR connector, User A activities aren't evaluated by this insider risk management policy for risk. Another example of a triggering indicator is if a user is in-scope for a *High* severity DLP policy alert.
- **Insider risk policy indicators**: Indicators included in insider risk management policies used to determine a risk score for an in-scope user. These policy indicators are only activated after a triggering indicator occurs for a user. Some examples of insider risk policy indicators are when a user copies data to personal cloud storage services or portable storage devices, or if a user shares internal files and folders with unauthorized external parties.

In some cases, you may want to limit the insider risk policy indicators that are applied to insider risk policies in your organization. You can turn off the policy indicators for specific areas by disabling them from all insider risk policies. Triggering indicators cannot be modified for insider risk policy templates.

To define the insider risk policy indicators that are enabled in all insider risk policies, navigate to **Insider risk settings** > **Indicators** and select one or more policy indicators. The indicators selected on the Indicators settings page cannot be individually configured when creating or editing an insider risk policy in the policy wizard.

>[!NOTE]
>It may take several hours for new manually-added users to appear in the **Users dashboard**. Activities for the previous 90 days for these users may take up to 24 hours to display. To view activities for manually added users, select the user on the **Users dashboard** and open the **User activity** tab on the details pane.

### Policy timeframes

Policy timeframes allow you to define past and future review periods that are triggered after policy matches based on events and activities for the insider risk management policy templates. Depending on the policy template you choose, the following policy timeframes are available:

- **Activation window**: Available for all policy templates, the *Activation window* is the defined number of days that the window activates **after** a triggering event. The window activates for 1 to 30 days after a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *Activation window* to 30 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *Activation window* and the policy is active for that user for 30 days after the triggering event occurred.
- **Past activity detection**: Available for all policy templates, the *Past activity detection* is the defined number of days that the window activates **before** a triggering event. The window activates for 0 to 180 days before a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *Past activity detection* to 90 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *Past activity detection* and the policy gathers historic activities for that user for 90 days prior to the triggering event.

### Intelligent detections

Intelligent detection settings help refine how the detections of risky activities are processed for alerts. In certain circumstances, you may need to define files types to ignore or you want to enforce a detection level for files to help define a minimum bar for alerts. When using offensive language policies, you may need to increase or decrease the detection sensitivity to control the amount of reported policy matches. Use these settings to control overall alert volume, file type exclusions, file volume limits, and the offensive language detection sensitivity.

#### Anomaly detections

Anomalous detections include settings for file type exclusions and file volume limits.

- **File type exclusions**: To exclude specific file types from all insider risk management policy matching, enter file type extensions separated by commas. For example, to exclude certain types of music files from policy matches you may enter *aac,mp3,wav,wma* in the **File type exclusions** field. Files with these extensions would be ignored by all insider risk management policies.
- **File volume cut off limit**: To define a minimum file level before activity alerts are reported in insider risk policies, enter the number of files. For example, you would enter '10' if you do not want to generate insider risk alerts when a user downloads 10 files or less, even if the policies consider this activity an anomaly.

#### Offensive language detections

To adjust the sensitivity of the offensive language classifier for policies using the *Offensive language in email* template, choose one of the following settings:

- **Low**: The lowest sensitivity level with the broadest range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is elevated.
- **Medium**: The mid-level sensitivity level with a balanced range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is average.
- **High**: The highest sensitivity level with a narrow range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is low.

#### Alert volume

User activities detected by insider risk policies are assigned a specific risk score, which in turn determines the alert severity (low, medium, high). By default, we'll generate a certain amount of low, medium, and high severity alerts, but you can increase or decrease the volume to suit your needs. To adjust the volume of alerts for all insider risk management policies, choose one of the following settings:

- **Fewer alerts**: You'll see all high severity alerts, fewer medium severity alerts, and no low severity ones. This setting level means you might miss some true positives.
- **Default volume**: You'll see all high severity alerts and a balanced amount of medium and low severity alerts.
- **More alerts**: You'll see all medium and high severity alerts and most low severity alerts. This setting level might result in more false positives.

## Create a new policy

To create a new insider risk management policy, you'll use the policy wizard in **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.
