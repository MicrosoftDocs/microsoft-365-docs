# Audit log activities

The tables in this article describe the activities that are audited in Microsoft 365. You can search for these events by searching the audit log in the compliance portal.

These tables group related activities or the activities from a specific service. The tables include the friendly name that's displayed in the **Activities** drop-down list (or that are available in PowerShell) and the name of the corresponding operation that appears in the detailed information of an audit record and in the CSV file when you export the search results. For descriptions of the detailed information, see [Audit log detailed properties](audit-log-detailed-properties.md).

> [!TIP]
> Select one of the links in the **In this article** list on the right side of this page to go to a specific table.

## Application administration activities

The following table lists application admin activities that are logged when an admin adds or changes an application that's registered in Azure AD. Any application that relies on Azure AD for authentication must be registered in the directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The operation names listed in the **Operation** column in the following table contain a period ( `.` ). You must include the period in the operation name if you specify the operation in a PowerShell command when searching the audit log, creating audit retention policies, creating alert policies, or creating activity alerts. Also be sure to use double quotation marks (`" "`) to contain the operation name.

## eDiscovery activities

Content Search and eDiscovery-related activities that are performed in the security and compliance portal or by running the corresponding PowerShell cmdlets are logged in the audit log. Includes the following activities:

- Creating and managing eDiscovery cases
- Creating, starting, and editing Content Searches
- Performing Content Search actions, such as previewing, exporting, and deleting search results
- Configuring permissions filtering for Content Search
- Managing the eDiscovery Administrator role

For a list and detailed description of the eDiscovery activities that are logged, see [Search for eDiscovery activities in the audit log](ediscovery-search-for-activities-in-the-audit-log.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It takes up to 30 minutes for events that result from the activities listed under **eDiscovery activities** and **eDiscovery (Premium) activities** in the **Activities** drop-down list to be displayed in the search results. Conversely, it takes up to 24 hours for the corresponding events from eDiscovery cmdlet activities to appear in the search results.

## eDiscovery (Premium) activities

You can also search the audit log for activities in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium). For a description of these activities, see the "eDiscovery (Premium) activities" section in [Search for eDiscovery activities in the audit log](ediscovery-search-for-activities-in-the-audit-log.md#ediscovery-premium-activities).

## Encrypted message portal activities

Access logs are available for encrypted messages through the encrypted message portal that lets your organization determine when messages are read, and forwarded by your external recipients. For more information on enabling and using encrypted message portal activity logs, see [Encrypted message portal activity log](audit-log-encrypted-messages.md).

Each audit entry for a tracked message contains the following fields:

- **MessageID**: Contains the ID of the message being tracked. The key identifier used to follow a message through the system.
- **Recipient**: List of all recipient email addresses.
- **Sender**: The originating email address.
- **AuthenticationMethod**: Describes the authenticating method for accessing the message, for example OTP, Yahoo, Gmail, or Microsoft.
- **AuthenticationStatus**: Contains a value indicating that the authentication succeeded or failed.
- **OperationStatus**: Indicates whether the indicated operation succeeded or failed.
- **AttachmentName**: Name of the attachment.
- **OperationProperties**: A list of optional properties. For example, the number of OTP passcodes sent, or the email subject.

## Exchange admin activities

Exchange administrator audit logging (which is enabled by default in Microsoft 365) logs an event in the audit log when an administrator (or a user who has been assigned administrative permissions) makes a change in your Exchange Online organization. Changes made by using the Exchange admin center or by running a cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell are logged in the Exchange admin audit log. Cmdlets that begin with the verbs **Get-**, **Search-**, or **Test-** aren't logged in the audit log. For more detailed information about admin audit logging in Exchange, see [Administrator audit logging](/exchange/administrator-audit-logging-exchange-2013-help).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Exchange Online cmdlets that aren't logged in the Exchange admin audit log (or in the audit log). Many of these cmdlets are related to maintaining the Exchange Online service and are run by Microsoft datacenter personnel or service accounts. These cmdlets aren't logged because they would result in a large number of "noisy" auditing events. If there's an Exchange Online cmdlet that isn't being audited, please submit a design change request (DCR) to Microsoft Support.

Here are some tips for searching for Exchange admin activities when searching the audit log:

- To return entries from the Exchange admin audit log, you have to select **Show results for all activities** in the **Activities** list. Use the date range boxes and the **Users** list to narrow the search results for cmdlets run by a specific Exchange administrator within a specific date range.
- To display events from the Exchange admin audit log, select the **Activity** column to sort the cmdlet names in alphabetical order.
- To get information about what cmdlet was run, which parameters and parameter values were used, and what objects were affected, you can export the search results by selecting the **Download all results** option. For more information, see [Export, configure, and view audit log records](audit-log-export-records.md).
- You can also use the `Search-UnifiedAuditLog -RecordType ExchangeAdmin` command in Exchange Online PowerShell to return only audit records from the Exchange admin audit log. It may take up to 30 minutes after an Exchange cmdlet is run for the corresponding audit log entry to be returned in the search results. For more information, see [Search-UnifiedAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-unifiedauditlog). For information about exporting the search results returned by the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** cmdlet to a CSV file, see the "Tips for exporting and viewing the audit log" section in [Export, configure, and view audit log records](audit-log-export-records.md#tips-for-exporting-and-viewing-the-audit-log).
- You can also view events in the Exchange admin audit log by using the Exchange admin center or running the **Search-AdminAuditLog** in Exchange Online PowerShell. The audit log is a good way to specifically search for activity performed by Exchange Online administrators. For instructions, see:

  - [View the administrator audit log](/exchange/security-and-compliance/exchange-auditing-reports/view-administrator-audit-log)
  - [Search-AdminAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-adminauditlog)

   Keep in mind that the same Exchange admin activities are logged in both the Exchange admin audit log and audit log.

## Exchange mailbox activities

The following table lists the activities that can be logged by mailbox audit logging. Mailbox activities performed by the mailbox owner, a delegated user, or an administrator are automatically logged in the audit log for up to 90 days. It's possible for an admin to turn off mailbox audit logging for all users in your organization. In this case, no mailbox actions for any user are logged. For more information, see [Manage mailbox auditing](audit-mailboxes.md).

 You can also search for mailbox activities by using the [Search-MailboxAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailboxauditlog) cmdlet in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

|Friendly name|Operation|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Accessed mailbox items|MailItemsAccessed|Messages were read or accessed in mailbox. Audit records for this activity are triggered in one of two ways: when a mail client (such as Outlook) performs a bind operation on messages or when mail protocols (such as Exchange ActiveSync or IMAP) sync items in a mail folder. This activity is only logged for users with an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5 license. Analyzing audit records for this activity is useful when investigating compromised email account. For more information, see the "Audit (Premium) events" section in [Audit (Premium)](audit-premium.md#audit-premium-events). |
|Added delegate mailbox permissions|Add-MailboxPermission|An administrator assigned the FullAccess mailbox permission to a user (known as a delegate) to another person's mailbox. The FullAccess permission allows the delegate to open the other person's mailbox, and read and manage the contents of the mailbox. The audit record for this activity is also generated when a system account in the Microsoft 365 service periodically performs maintenance tasks in behalf of your organization. A common task performed by a system account is updating the permissions for system mailboxes. For more information, see [System accounts in Exchange mailbox audit records](#system-accounts-in-exchange-mailbox-audit-records).|
|Added or removed user with delegate access to calendar folder|UpdateCalendarDelegation|A user was added or removed as a delegate to the calendar of another user's mailbox. Calendar delegation gives someone else in the same organization permissions to manage the mailbox owner's calendar.|
|Added permissions to folder|AddFolderPermissions|A folder permission was added. Folder permissions control which users in your organization can access folders in a mailbox and the messages located in those folders.|
|Copied messages to another folder|Copy|A message was copied to another folder.|
|Created mailbox item|Create|An item is created in the Calendar, Contacts, Notes, or Tasks folder in the mailbox. For example, a new meeting request is created. Creating, sending, or receiving a message isn't audited. Also, creating a mailbox folder isn't audited.|
|Created new inbox rule in Outlook web app|New-InboxRule|A mailbox owner or other user with access to the mailbox created an inbox rule in the Outlook web app.|
|Deleted messages from Deleted Items folder|SoftDelete|A message was permanently deleted or deleted from the Deleted Items folder. These items are moved to the Recoverable Items folder. Messages are also moved to the Recoverable Items folder when a user selects it and presses **Shift+Delete**.|
|Labeled message as a record|ApplyRecordLabel|A message was classified as a record. Occurs when a retention label that classifies content as a record is manually or automatically applied to a message.|
|Moved messages to another folder|Move|A message was moved to another folder.|
|Moved messages to Deleted Items folder|MoveToDeletedItems|A message was deleted and moved to the Deleted Items folder.|
|Modified folder permission|UpdateFolderPermissions|A folder permission was changed. Folder permissions control which users in your organization can access mailbox folders and the messages in the folder.|
|Modified inbox rule from Outlook web app|Set-InboxRule|A mailbox owner or other user with access to the mailbox modified an inbox rule using the Outlook web app.|
|Purged messages from the mailbox|HardDelete|A message was purged from the Recoverable Items folder (permanently deleted from the mailbox).|
|Removed delegate mailbox permissions|Remove-MailboxPermission|An administrator removed the FullAccess permission (that was assigned to a delegate) from a person's mailbox. After the FullAccess permission is removed, the delegate can't open the other person's mailbox or access any content in it.|
|Removed permissions from folder|RemoveFolderPermissions|A folder permission was removed. Folder permissions control which users in your organization can access folders in a mailbox and the messages located in those folders.|
|Sent message|Send|A message was sent, replied to or forwarded. This activity is only logged for users with an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5 license. For more information, see the "Audit (Premium) events" section in [Audit (Premium)](audit-premium.md#audit-premium-events).|
|Sent message using Send As permissions|SendAs|A message was sent using the SendAs permission. This means that another user sent the message as though it came from the mailbox owner.|
|Sent message using Send On Behalf permissions|SendOnBehalf|A message was sent using the SendOnBehalf permission. This means that another user sent the message on behalf of the mailbox owner. The message indicates to the recipient whom the message was sent on behalf of and who actually sent the message.|
|Updated inbox rules from Outlook client|UpdateInboxRules|A mailbox owner or other user with access to the mailbox created, modified, or removed an inbox rule by using the Outlook client.|
|Updated message|Update|A message or its properties was changed.|
|User signed in to mailbox|MailboxLogin|The user signed in to their mailbox.|
|Label message as a record||A user applied a retention label to an email message and that label is configured to mark the item as a record. |

### System accounts in Exchange mailbox audit records

In audit records for some mailbox activities (especially **Add-MailboxPermissions**), you may notice the user who performed the activity (and is identified in the User and UserId fields) is NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM(Microsoft.Exchange.Servicehost). This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was a system account in Exchange service in the Microsoft cloud. This system account often performs scheduled maintenance tasks on behalf of your organization. For example, a common audited activity performed by the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM(Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost) account is to update the permissions on the DiscoverySearchMailbox, which is a system mailbox. The purpose of this update is to verify that the FullAccess permission (which is the default) is assigned to the Discovery Management role group for the DiscoverySearchMailbox. Ensures that eDiscovery administrators can perform necessary tasks in their organization.

Another system user account that may be identified in an audit record for **Add-MailboxPermission** is Administrator@apcprd03.prod.outlook.com. This service account is also included in mailbox audit records related to verifying and updating the FullAccess permission is assigned to the Discovery Management role group for the DiscoverySearchMailbox system mailbox. Specifically, audit records that identify the Administrator@apcprd03.prod.outlook.com account are typically triggered when Microsoft support personnel run a role-based access control diagnostic tool on behalf of your organization.

## File and page activities

The following table describes the file and page activities in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.

|Friendly name|Operation|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Accessed file|FileAccessed|User or system account accesses a file. Once a user accesses a file, the FileAccessed event isn't logged again for the same user for same file for the next five minutes.|
|(none)|FileAccessedExtended|This is related to the "Accessed file" (FileAccessed) activity. A FileAccessedExtended event is logged when the same person continually accesses a file for an extended period (up to 3 hours). <br/><br/> The purpose of logging FileAccessedExtended events is to reduce the number of FileAccessed events that are logged when a file is continually accessed. This helps reduce the noise of multiple FileAccessed records for what is essentially the same user activity, and lets you focus on the initial (and more important) FileAccessed event.|
|Changed retention label for a file|ComplianceSettingChanged|A retention label was applied to or removed from a document. This event is triggered when a retention label is manually or automatically applied to a message.|
|Changed record status to locked|LockRecord|The record status of a retention label that classifies a document as a record was locked. This means the document can't be modified or deleted. Only users assigned at least the contributor permission for a site can change the record status of a document.|
|Changed record status to unlocked|UnlockRecord|The record status of a retention label that classifies a document as a record was unlocked. This means that the document can be modified or deleted. Only users assigned at least the contributor permission for a site can change the record status of a document.|
|Checked in file|FileCheckedIn|User checks in a document that they checked out from a document library.|
|Checked out file|FileCheckedOut|User checks out a document located in a document library. Users can check out and make changes to documents that have been shared with them.|
|Copied file|FileCopied|User copies a document from a site. The copied file can be saved to another folder on the site.|
|Deleted file|FileDeleted|User deletes a document from a site.|
|Deleted file from recycle bin|FileDeletedFirstStageRecycleBin|User deletes a file from the recycle bin of a site.|
|Deleted file from second-stage recycle bin|FileDeletedSecondStageRecycleBin|User deletes a file from the second-stage recycle bin of a site.|
|Deleted file marked as a record|RecordDelete|A document or email that was marked as a record was deleted. An item is considered a record when a retention label that marks items as a record is applied to content.|
|Detected document sensitivity mismatch|DocumentSensitivityMismatchDetected|User uploads a document to a site that's protected with a sensitivity label and the document has a higher priority sensitivity label than the sensitivity label applied to the site. For example, a document labeled Confidential is uploaded to a site labeled General. <br/><br/> This event isn't triggered if the document has a lower priority sensitivity label than the sensitivity label applied to the site. For example, a document labeled General is uploaded to a site labeled Confidential. For more information about sensitivity label priority, see [Label priority (order matters)](sensitivity-labels.md#label-priority-order-matters).|
|Detected malware in file|FileMalwareDetected|SharePoint anti-virus engine detects malware in a file.|
|Discarded file checkout|FileCheckOutDiscarded|User discards (or undoes) a checked out file. That means any changes they made to the file when it was checked out are discarded, and not saved to the version of the document in the document library.|
|Downloaded file|FileDownloaded|User downloads a document from a site.|
|Modified file|FileModified|User or system account modifies the content or the properties of a document on a site. The system waits five minutes before it logs another FileModified event when the same user modifies the content or properties of the same document.|
|(none)|FileModifiedExtended|This is related to the "Modified file" (FileModified) activity. A FileModifiedExtended event is logged when the same person continually modifies a file for an extended period (up to 3 hours). <br/><br/> The purpose of logging FileModifiedExtended events is to reduce the number of FileModified events that are logged when a file is continually modified. This helps reduce the noise of multiple FileModified records for what is essentially the same user activity, and lets you focus on the initial (and more important) FileModified event.|
|Moved file|FileMoved|User moves a document from its current location on a site to a new location.|
|(none)|FilePreviewed|User previews files on a SharePoint or OneDrive for Business site. These events typically occur in high volumes based on a single activity, such as viewing an image gallery.|
|Performed search query|SearchQueryPerformed|User or system account performs a search in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business. Some common scenarios where a service account performs a search query include applying an eDiscovery holds and retention policy to sites and OneDrive accounts, and auto-applying retention or sensitivity labels to site content.|
|Recycled a file | FileRecycled | User moves a file into the SharePoint Recycle Bin. |
|Recycled a folder | FolderRecycled | User moves a folder into the SharePoint Recycle Bin. |
|Recycled all minor versions of file|FileVersionsAllMinorsRecycled|User deletes all minor versions from the version history of a file. The deleted versions are moved to the site's recycle bin.|
|Recycled all versions of file|FileVersionsAllRecycled|User deletes all versions from the version history of a file. The deleted versions are moved to the site's recycle bin.|
|Recycled version of file|FileVersionRecycled|User deletes a version from the version history of a file. The deleted version is moved to the site's recycle bin.|
|Renamed file|FileRenamed|User renames a document.|
|Restored file|FileRestored|User restores a document from the recycle bin of a site.|
|Uploaded file|FileUploaded|User uploads a document to a folder on a site.|
|Viewed page|PageViewed|User views a page on a site. This doesn't include using a Web browser to view files located in a document library. Once a user views a page, the PageViewed event isn't logged again for the same user for same page for the next five minutes.|
|(none)|PageViewedExtended|This is related to the "Viewed page" (PageViewed) activity. A PageViewedExtended event is logged when the same person continually views a web page for an extended period (up to 3 hours). <br/><br/> The purpose of logging PageViewedExtended events is to reduce the number of PageViewed events that are logged when a page is continually viewed. This helps reduce the noise of multiple PageViewed records for what is essentially the same user activity, and lets you focus on the initial (and more important) PageViewed event.|
|View signaled by client|ClientViewSignaled|A user's client (such as website or mobile app) has signaled that the indicated page has been viewed by the user. This activity is often logged following a PagePrefetched event for a page. <br/><br/>**NOTE**: Because ClientViewSignaled events are signaled by the client, rather than the server, it's possible the event may not be logged by the server and therefore may not appear in the audit log. It's also possible that information in the audit record may not be trustworthy. However, because the user's identity is validated by the token used to create the signal, the user's identity listed in the corresponding audit record is accurate. The system waits five minutes before it logs the same event when the same user's client signals that the page has been viewed again by the user.|
|(none)|PagePrefetched|A user's client (such as website or mobile app) has requested the indicated page to help improve performance if the user browses to it. This event is logged to indicate that the page content has been served to the user's client. This event isn't a definitive indication that the user navigated to the page. <br/><br/> When the page content is rendered by the client (as per the user's request) a ClientViewSignaled event should be generated. Not all clients support indicating a pre-fetch, and therefore some pre-fetched activities might instead be logged as PageViewed events.|

### Frequently asked questions about FileAccessed and FilePreviewed events

**Could any non-user activities trigger FilePreviewed audit records that contain a user agent like "OneDriveMpc-Transform_Thumbnail"?**

We aren't aware of scenarios where non-user actions generate events like these. User actions like opening a user profile card (by selecting their name or email address in a message in Outlook on the web) would generate similar events.

**Are calls to the OneDriveMpc-Transform_Thumbnail always intentionally being triggered by the user?**

No. But similar events can be logged as a result of browser pre-fetch.

**If we see a FilePreviewed event coming from a Microsoft-registered IP address, does that mean that the preview was displayed on the screen of the user's device?**

No. The event might have been logged as a result of browser pre-fetch.

**Are there scenarios where a user previewing a document generates FileAccessed events?**

Both the FilePreviewed and FileAccessed events indicate that a user's call led to a read of the file (or a read of a thumbnail rendering of the file). While these events are intended to align with preview vs. access intention, the event distinction isn't a guarantee of the user's intent.

### The app\@sharepoint user in audit records

In audit records for some file activities (and other SharePoint-related activities), you may notice the user who performed the activity (identified in the User and UserId fields) is app@sharepoint. This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was an application. In this case, the application was granted permissions in SharePoint to perform organization-wide actions (such as search a SharePoint site or OneDrive account) on behalf of a user, admin, or service. This process of giving permissions to an application is called *SharePoint App-Only* access. This indicates that the authentication presented to SharePoint to perform an action was made by an application, instead of a user. This is why the app@sharepoint user is identified in certain audit records. For more information, see [Grant access using SharePoint App-Only](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs).

For example, app@sharepoint is often identified as the user for "Performed search query" and "Accessed file" events. That's because an application with SharePoint App-Only access in your organization performs search queries and accesses files when applying retention policies to sites and OneDrive accounts.

Here are a few other scenarios where app@sharepoint may be identified in an audit record as the user who performed an activity:

- **Microsoft 365 Groups**. When a user or admin creates a new group, audit records are generated for creating a site collection, updating lists, and adding members to a SharePoint group. These tasks are performed an application on behalf of the user who created the group.
- **Microsoft Teams**. Similar to Microsoft 365 Groups, audit records are generated for creating a site collection, updating lists, and adding members to a SharePoint group when a team is created.
- **Compliance features**. When an admin implements compliance features, such as retention policies, eDiscovery holds, and auto-applying sensitivity labels.

In these and other scenarios, you'll also notice that multiple audit records with app@sharepoint as the specified user were created within a short time frame, often within a few seconds of each other. This also indicates they were probably triggered by the same user-initiated task. Also, the ApplicationDisplayName and EventData fields in the audit record may help you identify the scenario or application that triggered the event.

## Folder activities

The following table describes the folder activities in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. As previously explained, audit records for some SharePoint activities will indicate the app@sharepoint user performed the activity of behalf of the user or admin who initiated the action. For more information, see [The app\@sharepoint user in audit records](#the-appsharepoint-user-in-audit-records).

|Friendly name|Operation|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Copied folder|FolderCopied|User copies a folder from a site to another location in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business.|
|Created folder|FolderCreated|User creates a folder on a site.|

### Forms activities performed by coauthors and anonymous responders

Forms supports collaboration when forms are designed and when analyzing responses. A form collaborator is known as a *coauthor*. Coauthors can do everything a form owner can do, except delete or move a form. Forms also allows you to create a form that can be responded to anonymously. This means the responder doesn't have to be signed into your organization to respond to a form.

The following table describes the auditing activities and information in the audit record for activities performed by coauthors and anonymous responders.

|Activity type|Internal or external user|User ID that's logged|Organization logged in to|Forms user type|

## Sharing and access request activities

The following table describes the user sharing and access request activities in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. For sharing events, the **Detail** column under **Results** identifies the name of the user or group the item was shared with and whether that user or group is a member or guest in your organization. For more information, see [Use sharing auditing in the audit log](audit-log-sharing.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Users can be either  *members*  or  *guests*  based on the UserType property of the user object. A member is usually an employee, and a guest is usually a collaborator outside of your organization. When a user accepts a sharing invitation (and isn't already part of your organization), a guest account is created for them in your organization's directory. Once the guest user has an account in your directory, resources may be shared directly with them (without requiring an invitation).
