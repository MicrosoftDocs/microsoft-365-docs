- [Insider risk management](insider-risk-management.md#learn-about-insider-risk-management-in-microsoft-365)


## Before you begin

- Make sure your [macOS devices are onboarded into Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-platform-macos) and enrolled in the [Company Portal app](/mem/intune/user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-macos-cp). 
- Make sure you have access to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home)
- This supports macOS version Catalina 10.15 and higher
- Install the v95+ Edge browser on your macOS devices 

## Onboard macOS devices into Microsoft 365 Compliance solutions using Microsoft Intune

Use these steps to onboard a macOS device into Compliance solutions if it already has MDE deployed to it.

1. You'll need these files for this procedure.

|file needed for |source |
|---------|---------|
|accessibility |[accessibility.mobileconfig](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/profiles/accessibility.mobileconfig)|
full disk access     |[fulldisk.mobileconfig](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/profiles/fulldisk.mobileconfig)|

> [!TIP]
> You can download the *.mobileconfig* files individually or in [single combined file](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/combined/mdatp-nokext.mobileconfig) that contains:
> - accessibility.mobileconfig
> - fulldisk.mobileconfig
> 
>
>If any of these individual files is updated, you'd need to download the either the combined file again or the single updated file individually.

### Create system configuration profiles

1. Open the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager center** > **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**.

1. Choose: **Create profile**. 

1. Choose:
    1. **Platform = macOS**
    1. **Profile type = Templates**
    1. **Template name = Custom**

1. Choose **Create**

1. Choose a name for the profile, like *AccessibilityformacOS* in this example. Choose **Next**.

1. Choose the **accessibility.mobileconfig** file that you downloaded in step 1 as the configuration profile file.

1. Choose **Next**

1. On the **Assignments** tab add the group you want to deploy these configurations to and choose **Next**.

### Update configuration profiles

1. Update the existing full disk access profile with the **fulldisk.mobileconfig** file.

```xml
<key>features</key>
<dict>
    <key>systemExtensions</key>
    <string>enabled</string>
    <key>dataLossPrevention</key>
    <string>enabled</string>
</dict>
```

## Offboard macOS devices using Intune

> [!IMPORTANT]

```xml
<key>features</key>
<dict>
    <key>systemExtensions</key>
