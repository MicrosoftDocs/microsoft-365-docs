# Add or remove members from a case

You can add or remove members to manage who can access the case. Users who are added to Reviewer or eDiscovery Manager role groups can be added as members of the case. The eDiscovery Manager who created the case is automatically added as a member. See [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/assign-ediscovery-permissions) for more details.

1. From the **Advanced eDiscovery** page, go to your case.

2. Go to **Settings** and select "Access & Permissions".

3. Click **Update**.

4. Under **Manage members**, select Add Icon Add to add members to the case. You can also choose to add a role group to the case. Under **Manage role groups**, select Add Icon Add.
    Keep in mind that role groups control permission to access the case. That means you can only assign Reviewer, eDiscovery Manager, or custom role groups with case management role.

5. In the list of people or role groups that can be added as members of the case, select the check box next to the names of the people or role groups that you want to add.

6. After you've selected the people or role groups to add as members of the group, select **Add**.

7. In **Manage this case**, select **Save** to save the new list of case members.

8. Select **Save** to save the new list of case members.
