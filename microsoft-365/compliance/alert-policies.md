# Alert policies in Microsoft 365

You can use alert policies and the alert dashboard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create alert policies and then view the alerts generated when users perform activities that match the conditions of an alert policy. There are several default alert policies that help you monitor activities such as assigning admin privileges in Exchange Online, malware attacks, phishing campaigns, and unusual levels of file deletions and external sharing.

> [!TIP]
> Go to the [Default alert policies](#default-alert-policies) section in this article for a list and description of the available alert policies.

Alert policies let you categorize the alerts that are triggered by a policy, apply the policy to all users in your organization, set a threshold level for when an alert is triggered, and decide whether to receive email notifications when alerts are triggered. There's also a **Alerts** page where you can view and filter alerts, set an alert status to help you manage alerts, and then dismiss alerts after you've addressed or resolved the underlying incident.

> [!NOTE]
> Alert policies are available for organizations with a Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Office 365 Enterprise, or Office 365 US Government E1/F1/G1, E3/F3/G3, or E5/G5 subscription. Advanced functionality is only available for organizations with an E5/G5 subscription, or for organizations that have an E1/F1/G1 or E3/F3/G3 subscription and a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P2 or a Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance or an E5 eDiscovery and Audit add-on subscription. The functionality that requires an E5/G5 or add-on subscription is highlighted in this topic. Also note that alert policies are available in Office 365 GCC, GCC High, and DoD US government environments.

## How alert policies work

Here's a quick overview of how alert policies work and the alerts that are triggers when user or admin activity matches the conditions of an alert policy.

![Overview of how alert policies work.](../media/M365ComplianceDefender-AlertPolicies-Overview.png)

1. An admin in your organization creates, configures, and turns on an alert policy by using the **Alert policies** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. You can also create alert policies by using the [New-ProtectionAlert](/powershell/module/exchange/new-protectionalert) cmdlet in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell.

   To create alert policies, you have to be assigned the Manage Alerts role or the Organization Configuration role in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Defender portal.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes up to 24 hours after creating or updating an alert policy before alerts can be triggered by the policy. This is because the policy has to be synced to the alert detection engine.

2. A user performs an activity that matches the conditions of an alert policy. In the case of malware attacks, infected email messages sent to users in your organization trigger an alert.

3. Microsoft 365 generates an alert that's displayed on the **Alerts** page in Microsoft 365 compliance center or Defender portal. Also, if email notifications are enabled for the alert policy, Microsoft sends a notification to a list of recipients. The alerts that an admin or other users can see that on the Alerts page is determined by the roles assigned to the user. For more information, see [RBAC permissions required to view alerts](#rbac-permissions-required-to-view-alerts).

4. An admin manages alerts in the compliance center. Managing alerts consists of assigning an alert status to help track and manage any investigation.

## Alert policy settings

An alert policy consists of a set of rules and conditions that define the user or admin activity that generates an alert, a list of users who trigger the alert if they perform the activity, and a threshold that defines how many times the activity has to occur before an alert is triggered. You also categorize the policy and assign it a severity level. These two settings help you manage alert policies (and the alerts that are triggered when the policy conditions are matched) because you can filter on these settings when managing policies and viewing alerts in the compliance center. For example, you can view alerts that match the conditions from the same category or view alerts with the same severity level.

To view and create alert policies:

### Microsoft 365 compliance center

Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 compliance center</a>, and then select **Policies** > **Alert** > **Alert policies**.

![In the compliance center, select Policies,and under Alert, select Alert policies to view and create alert policies.](../media/LaunchAlertPoliciesMCC.png)

### Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> and under **Email & collaboration** select **Policies & rules** > **Alert policy**. Alternatively, you can go directly to <https://security.microsoft.com/alertpolicies>.

![In the Defender portal, select Policies & rules under Email & collaboration, and then select Alert policy to view and create alert policies.](../media/LaunchAlertPoliciesDefenderPortal.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You have to be assigned the View-Only Manage Alerts role to view alert policies in the compliance center or Defender portal. You have to be assigned the Manage Alerts role to create and edit alert policies. For more information, see [Permissions in the security and compliance center](../security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

An alert policy consists of the following settings and conditions.

- **Activity the alert is tracking**. You create a policy to track an activity or in some cases a few related activities, such a sharing a file with an external user by sharing it, assigning access permissions, or creating an anonymous link. When a user performs the activity defined by the policy, an alert is triggered based on the alert threshold settings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The activities that you can track depend on your organization's Office 365 Enterprise or Office 365 US Government plan. In general, activities related to malware campaigns and phishing attacks require an E5/G5 subscription or an E1/F1/G1 or E3/F3/G3 subscription with an [Defender for Office 365](../security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365.md) Plan 2 add-on subscription.

- **Activity conditions**. For most activities, you can define additional conditions that must be met to trigger an alert. Common conditions include IP addresses (so that an alert is triggered when the user performs the activity on a computer with a specific IP address or within an IP address range), whether an alert is triggered if a specific user or users perform that activity, and whether the activity is performed on a specific file name or URL. You can also configure a condition that triggers an alert when the activity is performed by any user in your organization. The available conditions are dependent on the selected activity.

You can also define user tags as a condition of an alert policy. This results in the alerts triggered by the policy to include the context of the impacted user. You can use system user tags or custom user tags. For more information, see [User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/user-tags).

- **When the alert is triggered**. You can configure a setting that defines how often an activity can occur before an alert is triggered. This allows you to set up a policy to generate an alert every time an activity matches the policy conditions, when a certain threshold is exceeded, or when the occurrence of the activity the alert is tracking becomes unusual for your organization.

    ![Configure how alerts are triggered, based on when the activity occurs, a threshold, or unusual activity for your organization.](../media/howalertsaretriggered.png)

    If you select the setting based on unusual activity, Microsoft establishes a baseline value that defines the normal frequency for the selected activity. It takes up to seven days to establish this baseline, during which alerts won't be generated. After the baseline is established, an alert is triggered when the frequency of the activity tracked by the alert policy greatly exceeds the baseline value. For auditing-related activities (such as file and folder activities), you can establish a baseline based on a single user or based on all users in your organization; for malware-related activities, you can establish a baseline based on a single malware family, a single recipient, or all messages in your organization.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The ability to configure alert policies based on a threshold or based on unusual activity requires an E5/G5 subscription, or an E1/F1/G1 or E3/F3/G3 subscription with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P2, Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance, or Microsoft 365 eDiscovery and Audit add-on subscription. Organizations with an E1/F1/G1 and E3/F3/G3 subscription can only create alert policies where an alert is triggered every time that an activity occurs.

- **Alert category**. To help with tracking and managing the alerts generated by a policy, you can assign one of the following categories to a policy.

  - Data loss prevention

  - Information governance

  - Mail flow

  - Permissions

  - Threat management

  - Others

  When an activity occurs that matches the conditions of the alert policy, the alert that's generated is tagged with the category defined in this setting. This allows you to track and manage alerts that have the same category setting on the **Alerts** page in the compliance center because you can sort and filter alerts based on category.

- **Alert severity**. Similar to the alert category, you assign a severity attribute (**Low**, **Medium**, **High**, or **Informational**) to alert policies. Like the alert category, when an activity occurs that matches the conditions of the alert policy, the alert that's generated is tagged with the same severity level that's set for the alert policy. Again, this allows you to track and manage alerts that have the same severity setting on the **Alerts** page. For example, you can filter the list of alerts so that only alerts with a **High** severity are displayed.

    > [!TIP]
    > When setting up an alert policy, consider assigning a higher severity to activities that can result in severely negative consequences, such as detection of malware after delivery to users, viewing of sensitive or classified data, sharing data with external users, or other activities that can result in data loss or security threats. This can help you prioritize alerts and the actions you take to investigate and resolve the underlying causes.

- **Automated investigations**. Some alerts will trigger automated investigations to identify potential threats and risks that need remediation or mitigation.  In most cases these alerts are triggered by detection of malicious emails or activities, but in some cases the alerts are triggered by administrator actions in the security portal.  For more information about automated investigations, see [Automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](../security/office-365-security/office-365-air.md).

- **Email notifications**. You can set up the policy so that email notifications are sent (or not sent) to a list of users when an alert is triggered. You can also set a daily notification limit so that once the maximum number of notifications has been reached, no more notifications are sent for the alert during that day. In addition to email notifications, you or other administrators can view the alerts that are triggered by a policy on the **Alerts** page. Consider enabling email notifications for alert policies of a specific category or that have a higher severity setting.

## Default alert policies

Microsoft provides built-in alert policies that help identify Exchange admin permissions abuse, malware activity, potential external and internal threats, and information governance risks. On the **Alert policies** page, the names of these built-in policies are in bold and the policy type is defined as **System**. These policies are turned on by default. You can turn off these policies (or back on again), set up a list of recipients to send email notifications to, and set a daily notification limit. The other settings for these policies can't be edited.

The following table lists and describes the available default alert policies and the category each policy is assigned to. The category is used to determine which alerts a user can view on the Alerts page. For more information, see [RBAC permissions required to view alerts](#rbac-permissions-required-to-view-alerts).

The table also indicates the Office 365 Enterprise and Office 365 US Government plan required for each one. Some default alert policies are available if your organization has the appropriate add-on subscription in addition to an E1/F1/G1 or E3/F3/G3 subscription.
 
| Default alert policy | Description | Category | Automated investigation | Enterprise subscription |

|**Suspicious email forwarding activity**|Generates an alert when someone in your organization has autoforwarded email to a suspicious external account. This is an early warning for behavior that may indicate the account is compromised, but not severe enough to restrict the user. This policy has a **High** severity setting. Although it's rare, an alert generated by this policy may be an anomaly. It's a good idea to [check whether the user account is compromised](../security/office-365-security/responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.md).|Threat management|No|E1/F1/G1, E3/F3/G3, or E5/G5|
|**Suspicious email sending patterns detected**|Generates an alert when someone in your organization has sent suspicious email and is at risk of being restricted from sending email. This is an early warning for behavior that may indicate that the account is compromised, but not severe enough to restrict the user. This policy has a **Medium** severity setting. Although it's rare, an alert generated by this policy may be an anomaly. However, it's a good idea to [check whether the user account is compromised](../security/office-365-security/responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.md).|Threat management|Yes|E1/F1/G1, E3/F3/G3, or E5/G5  |
|**Tenant Allow/Block List entry is about to expire**|Generates an alert when a Tenant Allow/Block List entry is about to be removed. This event is triggered three days prior to expiration date, which is based when the entry was created or last updated. This alert policy has an **Informational** severity setting. This is to inform admins of upcoming changes in the filters since the allow or block could be going away. For blocks, you can extend the expiration date to keep the block in place. For allows, you need to resubmit the item so that our analysts can take another look. However, if the allow has already been graded as a false positive, then the entry will only expire when the system filters have been updated to naturally allow the entry. For more information on events that trigger this alert, see [Manage the Tenant Allow/Block list](../security/office-365-security/tenant-allow-block-list.md).|Threat management|No|E5/G5 or Defender for Office 365 P2 add-on subscription|
|**Tenant restricted from sending email**|Generates an alert when most of the email traffic from your organization has been detected as suspicious and Microsoft has restricted your organization from sending email. Investigate any potentially compromised user and admin accounts, new connectors, or open relays, and then contact Microsoft Support to unblock your organization. This policy has a **High** severity setting. For more information about why organizations are blocked, see [Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.7xx in Exchange Online](/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/non-delivery-reports-in-exchange-online/fix-error-code-5-7-700-through-5-7-750).|Threat management|No|E1/F1/G1, E3/F3/G3, or E5/G5|
|**Tenant restricted from sending unprovisioned email**|Generates an alert when too much email is being sent from unregistered domains (also known as *unprovisioned* domains). Office 365 allows a reasonable amount of email from unregistered domains, but you should configure every domain that you use to send email as an accepted domain. This alert indicates that all users in the organization can no longer send email. This policy has a **High** severity setting. For more information about why organizations are blocked, see [Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.7xx in Exchange Online](/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/non-delivery-reports-in-exchange-online/fix-error-code-5-7-700-through-5-7-750).|Threat management|No|E1/F1/G1, E3/F3/G3, or E5/G5|

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> We've temporarily removed this default alert policy based on customer feedback. We're working to improve it, and will replace it with a new version in the near future. Until then, you can create a custom alert policy to replace this functionality by using the following settings: <ul><li>Activity is Phish email detected at time of delivery</li> <li>Mail is not ZAP'd</li> <li>Mail direction is Inbound</li> <li>Mail delivery status is Delivered</li> <li>Detection technology is Malicious URL retention, URL detonation, Advanced phish filter, General phish filter, Domain impersonation, User impersonation, and Brand impersonation</li></ul> For more information about anti-phishing in Office 365, see [Set up anti-phishing and anti-phishing policies](../security/office-365-security/set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md).<br/><br/><sup>2</sup> To recreate this alert policy, follow the guidance in the previous footnote, but choose User impersonation as the only Detection technology.

The unusual activity monitored by some of the built-in policies is based on the same process as the alert threshold setting that was previously described. Microsoft establishes a baseline value that defines the normal frequency for "usual" activity. Alerts are then triggered when the frequency of activities tracked by the built-in alert policy greatly exceeds the baseline value.

## View alerts

When an activity performed by users in your organization matches the settings of an alert policy, an alert is generated and displayed on the **Alerts** page in the compliance center or the Defender portal. Depending on the settings of an alert policy, an email notification is also sent to a list of specified users when an alert is triggered. For each alert, the dashboard on the **Alerts** page displays the name of the corresponding alert policy, the severity and category for the alert (defined in the alert policy), and the number of times an activity has occurred that resulted in the alert being generated. This value is based on the threshold setting of the alert policy. The dashboard also shows the status for each alert. For more information about using the status property to manage alerts, see [Managing alerts](#manage-alerts).

To view alerts:

### Microsoft 365 compliance center

 Go to <https://compliance.microsoft.com> and then select **Alerts**. Alternatively, you can go directly to <https://compliance.microsoft.com/compliancealerts>.

![In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, select Alerts.](../media/ViewAlertsMCC.png)

### Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> and then select **Incidents & alerts** > **Alerts**. Alternatively, you can go directly to <https://security.microsoft.com/alerts>.

![In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select Incidents & alerts and then select Alerts.](../media/ViewAlertsDefenderPortal.png)

You can use the following filters to view a subset of all the alerts on the **Alerts** page.

- **Status.** Use this filter to show alerts that are assigned a particular status. The default status is **Active**. You or other administrators can change the status value.

- **Policy.** Use this filter to show alerts that match the setting of one or more alert policies. Or you can display all alerts for all alert policies.

- **Time range.** Use this filter to show alerts that were generated within a specific date and time range.

- **Severity.** Use this filter to show alerts that are assigned a specific severity.

- **Category.** Use this filter to show alerts from one or more alert categories.

- **Tags.** Use this filter to show alerts from one or more user tags. Tags are reflected based on tagged mailboxes or users that appear in the alerts. See [User tags in Office 356 ATP](../security/office-365-security/user-tags.md) to learn more.

- **Source.** Use this filter to show alerts triggered by alert policies in the compliance center or alerts triggered by Office 365 Cloud App Security policies, or both. For more information about Office 365 Cloud App Security alerts, see [Viewing Defender for Cloud Apps alerts](#viewing-cloud-app-security-alerts).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Filtering and sorting by user tags is currently in public preview.
> It may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided about it.

## Alert aggregation

When multiple events that match the conditions of an alert policy occur with a short period of time, they are added to an existing alert by a process called *alert aggregation*. When an event triggers an alert, the alert is generated and displayed on the **Alerts** page and a notification is sent. If the same event occurs within the aggregation interval, then Microsoft 365 adds details about the new event to the existing alert instead of triggering a new alert. The goal of alert aggregation is to help reduce alert "fatigue" and let you focus and take action on fewer alerts for the same event.

The length of the aggregation interval depends on your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription.

|Subscription|Aggregation interval|
|:---------|:---------:|
|Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5/G5|1 minute|
|Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 |1 minute|
|E5 Compliance add-on or E5 Discovery and Audit add-on|1 minute|
|Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E1/F1/G1 or E3/F3/G3|15 minutes|
|Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Exchange Online Protection|15 minutes|

When events that match the same alert policy occur within the aggregation interval, details about the subsequent event are added to the original alert. For all events, information about aggregated events is displayed in the details field and the number of times an event occurred with the aggregation interval is displayed in the activity/hit count field. You can view more information about all aggregated events instances by viewing the activity list.

The following screenshot shows an alert with four aggregated events. The activity list contains information about the four email messages relevant to the alert.

![Example of alert aggregation.](../media/AggregatedAlertExample.png)

Keep the following things in mind about alert aggregation:

- Alerts triggered by the **A potentially malicious URL click was detected** [default alert policy](#default-alert-policies) are not aggregated. This is because alerts triggered by this policy are unique to each user and email message.

- At this time, the **Hit count** alert property doesn't indicate the number of aggregated events for all alert policies. For alerts triggered by these alert policies, you can view the aggregated events by clicking **View message list** or **View activity** on the alert. We're working to make the number of aggregated events listed in the **Hit count** alert property available for all alert policies.

## RBAC permissions required to view alerts

The Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions assigned to users in your organization determine which alerts a user can see on the **Alerts** page. How is this accomplished? The management roles assigned to users (based on their membership in role groups in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Microsoft 365 Defender portal) determine which alert categories a user can see on the **Alerts** page. Here are some examples:

- Members of the Records Management role group can view only the alerts that are generated by alert policies that are assigned the **Information governance** category.

- Members of the Compliance Administrator  role group can't view alerts that are generated by alert policies that are assigned the **Threat management** category.

- Members of the eDiscovery Manager role group can't view any alerts because none of the assigned roles provide permission to view alerts from any alert category.

This design (based on RBAC permissions) lets you determine which alerts can be  viewed (and managed) by users in specific job roles in your organization.

The following table lists the roles that are required to view alerts from the six different alert categories. The first column in the tables lists all roles in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.  A check mark indicates that a user who is assigned that role can view alerts from the corresponding alert category listed in the top row.

To see which category a default alert policy is assigned to, see the table in [Default alert policies](#default-alert-policies).

## Manage alerts

After alerts have been generated and displayed on the **Alerts** page in the compliance center, you can triage, investigate, and resolve them. The same [RBAC permissions](#rbac-permissions-required-to-view-alerts) that give users access to alerts also give them the ability to manage alerts.

Here are some tasks you can perform to manage alerts.

- **Assign a status to alerts.** You can assign one of the following statuses to alerts: **Active** (the default value), **Investigating**, **Resolved**, or **Dismissed**. Then, you can filter on this setting to display alerts with the same status setting. This status setting can help track the process of managing alerts.

- **View alert details.** You can select an alert to display a flyout page with details about the alert. The detailed information depends on the corresponding alert policy, but it typically includes the following:

  - The name of the actual operation that triggered the alert, such as a cmdlet or an audit log operation.

  - A description of the activity that triggered the alert.

  - The user (or list of users) who triggered the alert. This is included only for alert policies that are set up to track a single user or a single activity.

  - The number of times the activity tracked by the alert was performed. This number may not match that actual number of related alerts listed on the Alerts page because more alerts may have been triggered.

  - A link to an activity list that includes an item for each activity that was performed that triggered the alert. Each entry in this list identifies when the activity occurred, the name of the actual operation (such as "FileDeleted"), the user who performed the activity, the object (such as a file, an eDiscovery case, or a mailbox) that the activity was performed on, and the IP address of the user's computer. For malware-related alerts, this links to a message list.

  - The name (and link) of the corresponding alert policy.

- **Suppress email notifications.** You can turn off (or suppress) email notifications from the flyout page for an alert. When you suppress email notifications, Microsoft won't send notifications when activities or events that match the conditions of the alert policy occur. But alerts will be triggered when activities performed by users match the conditions of the alert policy. You can also turn off email notifications by editing the alert policy.

- **Resolve alerts.** You can mark an alert as resolved on the flyout page for an alert (which sets the status of the alert to **Resolved**). Unless you change the filter, resolved alerts aren't displayed on the **Alerts** page.

## View Defender for Cloud Apps alerts

Alerts that are triggered by Office 365 Cloud App Security policies are now displayed on the **Alerts** page in the compliance center. This includes alerts that are triggered by activity policies and alerts that are triggered by anomaly detection policies in Office 365 Cloud App Security. This means you can view all alerts in the compliance center. Office 365 Cloud App Security is only available for organizations with an Office 365 Enterprise E5 or Office 365 US Government G5 subscription. For more information, see [Overview of Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security).

Organizations that have Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps as part of an Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 subscription or as a standalone service can also view Defender for Cloud Apps alerts that are related to Microsoft 365 apps and services in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

To display only Defender for Cloud Apps alerts in the compliance center or the Defender portal, use the **Source** filter and select **Defender for Cloud Apps**.

![Use the Source filter to display only Defender for Cloud Apps alerts.](../media/FilterCASAlerts.png)

Similar to an alert triggered by an alert policy in the compliance center, you can select a Defender for Cloud Apps alert to display a flyout page with details about the alert. The alert includes a link to view the details and manage the alert in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal and a link to the corresponding Defender for Cloud Apps policy that triggered the alert. See [Monitor alerts in Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/monitor-alerts).

![Alert details contain links to the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.](../media/CASAlertDetail.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing the status of a Defender for Cloud Apps alert in the compliance center won't update the resolution status for the same alert in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal. For example, if you mark the status of the alert as **Resolved** in the compliance center, the status of the alert in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal is unchanged. To resolve or dismiss a Defender for Cloud Apps alert, manage the alert in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.
