# Remediate app threats

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

You remediate app threats to your Microsoft 365 tenant through the **Alerts** page of the Microsoft app governance section of the Microsoft 365 Compliance center.

![The app governance alerts summary page in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center.](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-alerts.png)

The **Alerts** page by default lists new threat alerts generated by app governance and policy-based alerts generated by active app policies. You can view the details of a specific alert by selecting it, which opens an alert pane with additional alert information and the ability to change its status.

From this pane, you can get this additional information:

- Additional details on the alert from the **Description** field.
- The name of the app policy that generated the alert from the **Policy name** field. You can also select **View policy** to go to the app policy that generated the alert.

App policies that you configured for automatic remediation from the **Action** will have a status of **Resolved**.

You can remediate an app alert with these steps:

1. Investigation: Examine the information in the alert and change its status to **Mark in progress**.
2. Resolution: After your investigation and, as needed, the determination of app policy changes or continued app support in your tenant, change its status to **Resolved**.

Based on app alert patterns, you can update the appropriate app policy and change its **Action** setting to perform automatic remediation. This removes your need to investigate and manually resolve future alerts that are generated by the app policy. For more information, see [Manage your app policies](app-governance-app-policies-manage.md).
