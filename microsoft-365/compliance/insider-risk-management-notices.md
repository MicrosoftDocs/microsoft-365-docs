# Insider risk management notice templates

Insider risk management notice templates allow you to automatically send email messages to users when a case is created for activities that have generated a policy match and confirmed alert. For most alerts that generate cases, user actions are the result of mistakes or inadvertent activities without ill intent. Notices serve as simple reminders to users to be more careful, to provide links to information for refresher training, or to corporate policy resources. Notices can be an important part of your internal compliance training program and can help create a documented audit trail for users with recurring risk activities.

Create notice templates if you want to send users an email reminder notice for policy matches as part of the case resolution process. Notices can only be sent to the user email address associated with the specific case being reviewed. When selecting a notice template to apply to a policy match, you can choose to accept the field values defined in the template or overwrite the fields as needed

## Notice templates dashboard

The **Notices templates dashboard** displays a list of configured notice templates and allows you to create new notice templates. The notice templates are listed in reverse date order with the most recent notice template listed first.

## HTML for notices

If you'd like to create more than a simple text-based email message for notifications, you can create a more detailed message by using HTML in the message body field of a notice template. The following example provides the message body format for a basic HTML-based email notification template:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>Action Required: Contoso User Code of Conduct Policy Training</h2>
<p>A recent activity you've performed has generated a risk alert prohibited by the Contoso User <a href='https://www.contoso.com'>Code of Conduct Policy</a>.</p>
<p>You are required to attend the Contoso User Code of Conduct <a href='https://www.contoso.com'>training</a> within the next 14 days. Please contact <a href='mailto:hr@contoso.com'>Human Resources</a> with any questions about this training request.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><em>Human Resources</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

> [!NOTE]
> HTML href attribute implementation in the insider risk management notice templates currently support only single quotation marks instead of double quotation marks for URL references.
