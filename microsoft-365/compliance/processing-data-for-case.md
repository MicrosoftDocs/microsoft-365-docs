# Work with processing errors in Advanced eDiscovery

Processing is the process of file identification, expansion of embedded documents and attachments, text extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of image files and indexing of that content.  

When you add a custodian to a case on the **Custodians** tab, all partially indexed items from Office 365 are processed to make them fully searchable. Likewise, when content is added to a review set from both Office 365 and  non-Office 365 data sources, this content is also processed.

The **Processing** tab in Advanced eDiscovery provides insight into the status of advanced indexing for different processing scenarios.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Advanced indexing of custodian data](indexing-custodian-data.md)
- [Error remediation when processing data](error-remediation.md)
- [Single item error remediation](single-item-error-remediation.md)
