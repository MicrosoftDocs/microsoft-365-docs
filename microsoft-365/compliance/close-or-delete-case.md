# Close or delete a case

When the legal case or investigation supported by an eDiscovery case is completed, you can close the case. Here's what happens when you close a case:

- If the case contains any content locations on hold, those holds will be turned off. This might result in content being permanently deleted or purged, either by the user or by an automated process, such as a deletion policy.

- Closing a case only turns off the holds that are associated with that case. If other holds are place on a content location (such as a Litigation Hold. a Preservation Policy, or a hold from a different eDiscovery case) those holds will still be maintained.

- The case is still listed on the eDiscovery page in the Security & Compliance Center. The details, holds, searches, and members of a closed case are retained.

- You can edit a case after it's closed. For example, you can add or removing members, create searches, export search results, and prepare search results for analysis in Advanced eDiscovery. The primary difference between active and closed cases is that holds are turned off when a case is closed.

To close a case:

1. On the **Advanced eDiscovery** page, select the case that you want to close.

2. On the **Settings** tab, under **Case Information**, click **Select**.

3. Click **Close case**.

To delete a case:

1. On the **Advanced eDiscovery** page, select the case that you want to delete.

2. On the **Settings** tab, under **Case Information**, click **Select**.

3. Click **Delete case**.
