# Set up users and cases in Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery

This topic describes how to set up users and cases for Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
## Prerequisites

Before setting up cases and users in Advanced eDiscovery, the following is required:
  
- To analyze a user's data using Advanced eDiscovery, the user (the custodian of the data) must be assigned an Office 365 E5 license. Alternatively, users with an Office 365 E1 or E3 license can be assigned an Advanced eDiscovery standalone license. Administrators and compliance officers who are assigned to cases and use Advanced eDiscovery to analyze data don't need an E5 license. 
    
- You have to be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center to create an eDiscovery case and add members to it. To add yourself to the eDiscovery Manager role group in Security &amp; Compliance Center, you have to be a global administrator in your Office 365 organization. If you're not a global administrator, you 'll have to ask a global administrator to add you to the eDiscovery Manager role group. For more information, see:

  - [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Microsoft‚Äç 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](assign-ediscovery-permissions.md)
    
## Step 1: Assign users eDiscovery permissions

The first step is to assign users the requirement permissions in the Security &amp; Compliance Center so that they can me added as a member of an eDiscovery case. After a user is added as a member of a case in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, they'll be able to access the case in Advanced eDiscovery.
  
To assign a user the necessary permissions so they can be added as a member of an eDiscovery case, see Step 1 in [eDiscovery cases in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery-cases.md#step-1-assign-ediscovery-permissions-to-potential-case-members).
  
## Step 2: Create an eDiscovery case and add members

The next step is to create a new eDiscovery case in the Security &amp; Compliance Center and add members. Members of the case will then be able to access the case in Advanced eDiscovery.
  
1. To create a new eDiscovery case, see Step 2 in [eDiscovery cases in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery-cases.md#step-2-create-a-new-case).
    
2. To add members to an eDiscovery case, see Step 3 in [eDiscovery cases in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery-cases.md#step-3-add-members-to-a-case)
    
## Step 3: Go a case in Advanced eDiscovery

After you create an eDiscovery case and add members, you (or any member of the case) can access the corresponding case in Advanced eDiscovery. To access a case in Advanced eDiscovery, see Step 8 in [eDiscovery cases in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery-cases.md#step-8-go-to-the-case-in-advanced-ediscovery).
