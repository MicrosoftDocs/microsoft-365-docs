# Plan for security &amp; compliance

Managing security and compliance is a partnership. You are responsible for protecting your data, identities, and devices, while Microsoft vigorously protects Microsoft 365 services. You can use Microsoft 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) together to help you achieve the appropriate level of protection for your organization.
  
## Step 1: Review capabilities

Orient yourself to the information protection capabilities in the Information Protection for Office 365 poster. 
  
[Deploy information protection for data privacy regulations with Microsoft 365](../solutions/information-protection-deploy.md?view=o365-worldwide)
  
## Step 2: Check your Secure Score

After setting up your Microsoft 365 subscription, take note of your starting score. Secure Score provides configuration suggestions that you can take to increase your score. The goal is to be aware of opportunities that you can take to protect your environment which won't negatively affect the productivity of your users.

## Step 3: Plan access protection for identity and devices

Protecting access to your Microsoft 365 data and services is crucial to defending against cyberattacks and guarding against data loss.

## Step 4: Plan data protection based on data sensitivity

Review and plan for file protection capabilities organized by three levels of protection.

## Step 5: Leverage the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center

The Security &amp; Compliance Center gives you a single view into the controls you will use to manage the spectrum of Microsoft 365 security, including threat management, data governance, and search and investigation. 
  
- [Go to the Security &amp; Compliance Center](./microsoft-365-compliance-center.md)
    
- [Permissions in the Security &amp; Compliance Center](~/security/office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md)
    
- [Give users access to the Security &amp; Compliance Center](~/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center.md)
    
## Step 6: Use end-to-end security scenarios as starting points

Use these recommended configurations as a starting point for enterprise scale or sophisticated access security scenarios.
  
- [Secure email policies and configurations](../security/office-365-security/secure-email-recommended-policies.md)
    
- [Contoso in the Microsoft Cloud](../enterprise/contoso-case-study.md)
