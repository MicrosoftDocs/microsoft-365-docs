# Set user permissions and assign roles in privacy management (preview)

In this article: learn how to set **permissions** and assign users to **role groups** and **roles**.

To give members of your organization permissions to use privacy management, assign them to the appropriate role groups in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. Note that roles specific to privacy management will not appear in Azure Active Directory.

## Sign in and set permissions

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and select **Permissions** in the left navigation.  
2. Under the **Compliance center** dropdown, select **Roles**. The full list of role groups will appear.
3. Find the role group to which you want to add one or more users, and check the box to the left of the group name. See below for a list of privacy management roles.  
4. On the flyout pane for that group, select **Edit** under the **Members** header.  
5. Select **Choose members**. Another flyout window will appear.
6. Select **+ Add** to choose one or more users to add to the group.  
7. Select the checkbox next to the names you want to add, then select the **Add** button at the bottom.  
8. When you’re done assigning users, select **Done**, then **Save**, then **Close**.

## Role groups and roles

Members should be assigned to role groups depending on what tasks they need to accomplish and what level of file access is appropriate. Each role group includes one or more roles. These roles may pertain to specific privacy management tasks or key functions that are enabled or restricted for that group’s members.  

Role groups can be customized if needed. To avoid accidental loss of access, we recommend creating a copy of the existing role group you wish to customize, giving the copy an identifiable name, making and verifying your changes to the new group, and assigning people to it as appropriate.
