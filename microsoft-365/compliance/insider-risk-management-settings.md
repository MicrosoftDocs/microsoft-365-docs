# Get started with insider risk management settings

Insider risk management settings apply to all insider risk management policies, regardless of the template you chose when creating a policy. Settings are configured using the **Insider risk settings** control located at the top of all insider risk management tabs. These settings control policy components for the following areas:

- Privacy
- Indicators
- Policy timelines
- Intelligent detections
- Export alerts
- Priority user groups

Before you get started and create insider risk management policies, it's important to understand these settings and choose setting levels best for the compliance needs for your organization.

## Privacy

Protecting the privacy of users that have policy matches is important and can help promote objectivity in data investigation and analysis reviews for insider risk alerts. For users with an insider risk policy match, you can choose one of the following settings:

- **Show anonymized versions of usernames**: User names are anonymized to prevent admins, data investigators, and reviewers from seeing who is associated with policy alerts. For example, a user 'Grace Taylor' would appear with a randomized pseudonym such as 'AnonIS8-988' in all areas of the insider risk management experience. Choosing this setting anonymizes all users with current and past policy matches and applies to all policies. User profile information in the insider risk alert and case details will not be available when this option is chosen. However, usernames are displayed when adding new users to existing policies or when assigning users to new policies. If you choose to turn off this setting, usernames will be displayed for all users that have current or past policy matches.
- **Do not show anonymized versions of usernames**: Usernames are displayed for all current and past policy matches for alerts and cases. User profile information (the name, title, alias, and organization or department) is displayed for the user for all insider risk management alerts and cases.

## Indicators

Insider risk policy templates define the type of risk activities that you want to detect and investigate. Each policy template is based on specific indicators that correspond to specific triggers and risk activities. All indicators are disabled by default, and you must select one or more policy indicators before configuring an insider risk management policy.

Alerts are triggered by policies when users perform activities related to policy indicators that meet a required threshold. Insider risk management uses two types of indicators:

- **Triggering events**: Events that determine if a user is active for an insider risk management policy. If a user is added to an insider risk management policy does not have a triggering event, the user activity is not evaluated by the policy. For example, User A is added to a policy created from the *Data theft by departing users* policy template and the policy and Microsoft 365 HR connector are properly configured. Until User A has a termination date reported by the HR connector, User A activities aren't evaluated by this insider risk management policy for risk. Another example of a triggering event is if a user has a *High* severity DLP policy alert when using *Data leaks* policies.
- **Policy indicators**: Indicators included in insider risk management policies used to determine a risk score for an in-scope user. These policy indicators are only activated after a triggering event occurs for a user. Some examples of policy indicators are when a user copies data to personal cloud storage services or portable storage devices, or if a user shares internal files and folders with unauthorized external parties.

Policy indicators are segmented into the following areas. You can choose the indicators to activate and customize indicator event limits for each indicator level when creating an insider risk policy:

- **Office indicators**: These include policy indicators for SharePoint sites, Teams, and email messaging.
- **Device indicators**: These include policy indicators for activity such as sharing files over the network or with devices. Indicators include activity involving Microsoft Office files, .CSV files, and .PDF files. If you select **Device indicators**, activity is processed only for devices with Windows 10 Build 1809 or higher. For more information on configuring devices for integration with insider risk, see [Getting started with Endpoint DLP](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md).
- **Security policy violation indicator**: These include indicators from Microsoft Defender ATP related to unapproved or malicious software installation or bypassing security controls. To receive alerts in insider risk management, you must have an active Microsoft Defender ATP license and insider risk integration enabled. For more information on configuring Microsoft Defender ATP for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Microsoft Defender ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features\#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center).
- **Risk score boosters**: These include raising the risk score for unusual activities or past policy violations. Enabling risk score boosters increase risk scores and the likelihood of alerts for these types of activities. Risk score boosters can only be selected if one or more indicators above are selected.

![Insider risk management indicator settings](../media/insider-risk-settings-indicators.png)

In some cases, you may want to limit the insider risk policy indicators that are applied to insider risk policies in your organization. You can turn off the policy indicators for specific areas by disabling them from all insider risk policies. Triggering events cannot be modified for insider risk policy templates.

To define the insider risk policy indicators that are enabled in all insider risk policies, navigate to **Insider risk settings** > **Indicators** and select one or more policy indicators. The indicators selected on the Indicators settings page cannot be individually configured when creating or editing an insider risk policy in the policy wizard.

>[!NOTE]
>It may take several hours for new manually-added users to appear in the **Users dashboard**. Activities for the previous 90 days for these users may take up to 24 hours to display. To view activities for manually added users, select the user on the **Users dashboard** and open the **User activity** tab on the details pane.

### Indicator level settings (preview)

When creating a policy in the policy wizard, you can configure how the daily number of risk events should influence the risk score for insider risk alerts. These indicator settings help you control how the number of occurrences of risk events in your organization should affect the risk score, and consequently the associated alert severity, for these events. If you prefer, you can also choose to keep the default event threshold levels recommended by Microsoft for all enabled indicators.

For example, you decide to enable SharePoint indicators in the insider risk policy settings and to set custom thresholds for SharePoint events when configuring indicators for a new insider risk *Data leaks* policy. While in the insider risk policy wizard, you configure three different daily event levels for each SharePoint indicator to influence the risk score for alerts associated with these events.

![Insider risk management custom indicator settings](../media/insider-risk-custom-indicators.png)

For the first daily event level, you set the threshold at *10 or more events per day* for a lower impact to the risk score for the events, *20 or more events per day* for a medium impact to the risk score for the events, and *30 or more events per day* a higher impact to the risk score for the events. These settings effectively mean:

- If there are 1-9 SharePoint events that take place after triggering event, risk scores are minimally impacted and would tend not to generate an alert.
- If there are 10-19  SharePoint events that take place after a triggering event, the risk score is inherently lower and alert severity levels would tend to be at a low level.
- If there are 20-29 SharePoint events that take place after a triggering, the risk score is inherently higher and alert severity levels would tend to be at a medium level.
- If there are 30 or more SharePoint events that take place after a triggering, the risk score is inherently higher and alert severity levels would tend to be at a high level.

## Policy timeframes

Policy timeframes allow you to define past and future review periods that are triggered after policy matches based on events and activities for the insider risk management policy templates. Depending on the policy template you choose, the following policy timeframes are available:

- **Activation window**: Available for all policy templates, the *Activation window* is the defined number of days that the window activates **after** a triggering event. The window activates for 1 to 30 days after a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *Activation window* to 30 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *Activation window* and the policy is active for that user for 30 days after the triggering event occurred.
- **Past activity detection**: Available for all policy templates, the *Past activity detection* is the defined number of days that the window activates **before** a triggering event. The window activates for 0 to 180 days before a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *Past activity detection* to 90 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *Past activity detection* and the policy gathers historic activities for that user for 90 days prior to the triggering event.

## Intelligent detections

Intelligent detection settings help refine how the detections of risky activities are processed for alerts. In certain circumstances, you may need to define files types to ignore or you want to enforce a detection level for files to help define a minimum bar for alerts. When using offensive language policies, you may need to increase or decrease the detection sensitivity to control the amount of reported policy matches. Use these settings to control overall alert volume, file type exclusions, file volume limits, and the offensive language detection sensitivity.

![Insider risk management intelligent detections settings](../media/insider-risk-settings-detections.png)

### Anomaly detections

Anomalous detections include settings for file type exclusions and file volume limits.

- **File type exclusions**: To exclude specific file types from all insider risk management policy matching, enter file type extensions separated by commas. For example, to exclude certain types of music files from policy matches you may enter *aac,mp3,wav,wma* in the **File type exclusions** field. Files with these extensions would be ignored by all insider risk management policies.
- **File volume cut-off limit**: To define a minimum file level before activity alerts are reported in insider risk policies, enter the number of files. For example, you would enter '10' if you do not want to generate insider risk alerts when a user downloads 10 files or less, even if the policies consider this activity an anomaly.

### Offensive language detections

To adjust the sensitivity of the offensive language classifier for policies using the *Offensive language in email* template, choose one of the following settings:

- **Low**: The lowest sensitivity level with the broadest range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is elevated.
- **Medium**: The mid-level sensitivity level with a balanced range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is average.
- **High**: The highest sensitivity level with a narrow range for detection offensive language and sentiment. The probability of false positives for offensive language matching is low.

### Alert volume

User activities detected by insider risk policies are assigned a specific risk score, which in turn determines the alert severity (low, medium, high). By default, we'll generate a certain amount of low, medium, and high severity alerts, but you can increase or decrease the volume to suit your needs. To adjust the volume of alerts for all insider risk management policies, choose one of the following settings:

- **Fewer alerts**: You'll see all high severity alerts, fewer medium severity alerts, and no low severity ones. This setting level means you might miss some true positives.
- **Default volume**: You'll see all high severity alerts and a balanced amount of medium and low severity alerts.
- **More alerts**: You'll see all medium and high severity alerts and most low severity alerts. This setting level might result in more false positives.

### Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (preview)

[Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) (ATP) is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. To have better visibility of security violation in your organization, you can import and filter Microsoft Defender ATP alerts for activities used in policies created from insider risk management security violation policy templates.

Depending on the types of signals you are interested in, you can choose to import alerts to insider risk management based on the Microsoft Defender ATP alert triage status. You can define one or more of the following alert triage statuses in the global settings to import:

- Unknown
- New
- In progress
- Resolved

Alerts from Microsoft Defender ATP are imported daily. Depending on the triage status you choose, you may see multiple user activities for the same alert as the triage status changes in Microsoft Defender ATP.

For example, if you select *New*, *In progress*, and *Resolved* for this setting, when a Microsoft Defender ATP alert is generated and the status is *New*, an initial alert activity is imported for the user in insider risk. When the Microsoft Defender ATP triage status changes to *In progress*, a second activity for this alert is imported for the user in insider risk. When the final Microsoft Defender ATP triage status of *Resolved* is set, a third activity for this alert is imported for the user in insider risk. This functionality allows investigators to follow the progression of the Microsoft Defender ATP alerts and choose the level of visibility that their investigation requires.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You'll need to have Microsoft Defender ATP configured in your organization and enable Microsoft Defender ATP for insider risk management integration in the Defender Security Center to import security violation alerts. For more information on configuring Microsoft Defender ATP for insider risk management integration, see [Configure advanced features in Microsoft Defender ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-features\#share-endpoint-alerts-with-microsoft-compliance-center).

### Domains (preview)

Domain settings help you define risk levels for communications to specific domains. These communications include sharing files, email messages, or downloading content. By specifying domains in these settings, you can increase or decrease the risk scoring for activity that takes place with these domains. For example, to specify contoso.com and sales.wingtiptoys.com as allowed domains, you will enter 'contoso.com sales.wingtiptoys.com' in the **Allowed domains** field.

For each of the following domain settings, you can enter up to 500 domains:

- **Unallowed domains:** By specifying unallowed domains, activity that takes place with these domains will have *higher* risk scores.
- **Allowed domains:** By specifying allowed domains in settings, activity that takes place with these domains will have *lower* risk scores and is treated similarly to how internal organization activity is treated. For example, email activities to these domains are analyzed similarly to how internal email activity is analyzed.
- **Third party domains:** Third party domains are domains used for business purposes at your organization and sensitive content may be stored across these locations. By specifying a third party domain, you can receive alerts for any risky activity on these domains.

## Export alerts (preview)

Insider risk management alert information is exportable to security information and event management (SIEM) services via the [Office 365 Management Activity API schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#security-and-compliance-alerts-schema). You can use the Office 365 Management Activity APIs to export alert information to other applications your organization may use to manage or aggregate insider risk information.

To use the APIs to review insider risk alert information:

1. Enable Office 365 Management Activity API support in the insider risk management settings. By default, this setting is disabled for your Microsoft 365 organization.
2. Filter the common Office 365 audit activities by *SecurityComplianceAlerts*.
3. Filter *SecurityComplianceAlerts* by the *InsiderRiskManagement* category.

## Priority user groups (preview)

Users in your organization may have different levels of risk depending on their position, level of access to sensitive information, or risk history. Prioritizing the examination and scoring of the activities of these users can help alert you to potential risks that may have higher consequences for your organization. Priority user groups in insider risk management help define the users in your organization that need closer inspection and more sensitive risk scoring. Coupled with the *Security policy violations by priority users* and *Data leaks by priority users* policy templates, users added to a priority user group have an increased likelihood of insider risk alerts and alerts with higher severity levels.

![Insider risk management priority user group settings](../media/insider-risk-settings-priority-users.png)

For example, you need to protect against data leaks for a highly confidential project where users have access to sensitive information. You choose to create *Confidential Project* *Users* priority user group for users in your organization that work on this project. Using the policy wizard and the *Data leaks by priority users* policy template, you create a new policy and assign the *Confidential Project Users* priority users group to the policy. Activities examined by the policy for members of the *Confidential Project Users* priority user group are more sensitive to risk and activities by these users will be more likely to generate an alert and have alerts with higher severity levels.

### Create a priority user group

To create a new priority user group, you'll use setting controls in the **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. To create a priority user group, you must be a member of the *Insider Risk Management* or *Insider Risk Management Admin* role group.

Complete the following steps to create a priority user group:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select **Insider risk settings**.
2. Select the **Priority user groups** tab
3. On the **Priority user groups** tab, select **Create priority user group** to start the group creation wizard.
4. On the **Define group** page, complete the following fields:
    - **Name (required)**: Enter a friendly name for the priority user group. You can't change the name of the priority user group after you complete the wizard.
    - **Description (optional)**: Enter a description for the priority user group.
5. Select **Next** to continue.
6. On the **Choose members** page, select **Choose members** to search and select which mail-enabled user accounts are included in the group or select the **Select all** checkbox to add all users in your organization to the group. Select **Add** to continue or **Cancel** to close without adding any users to the group.
7. Select **Next** to continue.
8. On the **Review** page, review the settings you've chosen for the priority user group. Select **Edit** to change any of the group values or select **Submit** to create and activate the priority user group.
9. On the confirmation page, select **Done** to exit the wizard.

### Update a priority user group

To update an existing priority user group, you'll use setting controls in the **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. To update a priority user group, you must be a member of the *Insider Risk Management* or *Insider Risk Management Admin* role group.

Complete the following steps to edit a priority user group:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select **Insider risk settings**.
2. Select the **Priority user groups** tab
3. Select the priority user group you want to edit and select **Edit group**.
4. On the **Define group** page, update the Description field if needed. You can't update the name of the priority user group. Select **Next** to continue.
5. On the **Choose members** page, add new members to the group using the **Choose members** control. To remove a user from the group, select the 'X' next to the user you wish to remove. Select **Next** to continue.
6. On the **Review** page, review the update settings you've chosen for the priority user group. Select **Edit** to change any of the group values or select **Submit** to update the priority user group.
7. On the confirmation page, select **Done** to exit the wizard.

### Delete a priority user group

To delete an existing priority user group, you'll use setting controls in the **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. To delete a priority user group, you must be a member of the *Insider Risk Management* or *Insider Risk Management Admin* role group.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Deleting a priority user group will remove it from any active policy to which it is assigned. If you delete a priority user group that is assigned to an active policy, the policy will not contain any in-scope users and will effectively be idle and will not create alerts.

Complete the following steps to delete a priority user group:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select **Insider risk settings**.
2. Select the **Priority user groups** tab
3. Select the priority user group you want to edit and select **Delete** from the dashboard menu.
4. On the **Delete** dialog, select **Yes** to delete the priority user group or select **Cancel** to return to the dashboard.
