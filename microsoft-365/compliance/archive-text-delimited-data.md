This connector lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Microsoft 365. After your archive this data, you can use compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage third-party data."

# Set up a connector to archive text-delimited data

Use a Veritas connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive text-delimited data to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. Veritas provides a [text-delimited connector](https://globanet.com/text-delimited) that's configured to capture items from a third-party data source (on a regular basis) and import those items to Microsoft 365. The connector converts content from the text-delimited data source to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After text-delimited data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, and retention policies and retention labels. Using a text-delimited data connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

## Overview of archiving the text-delimited data

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive text-delimited source information in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for text-delimited data](../media/TextDelimitedConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with the text-delimited source to set up and configure a text-delimited site.

2. Once every 24 hours, chat messages from the text-delimited source are copied to the Veritas Merge1 site. The connector also converts the content to an email message format.

3. The text-delimited connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center connects to the Veritas Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted message items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in Step 3. A new subfolder in the Inbox folder named **Text- Delimited** is created in the user mailboxes, and the message items are imported to that folder. The connector determines which mailbox to import items to by using the value of the *Email* property. Every message contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant.

## Before you begin

- Create a Veritas Merge1 account for Microsoft connectors. To create this account, contact [Veritas Customer Support](https://globanet.com/ms-connectors-contact). You will sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the text-delimited connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to a role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the text-delimited connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and create a connector for text-delimited data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** > **Text-Delimited**.

2. On the **text-delimited** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the Text-delimited connector on the Veritas Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the text-delimited connector on the Merge1 site. For information about configuring  the text-delimited connector on the Veritas Merge1 site, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20text-delimited%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, the **User mapping** page in the connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 compliance center is displayed.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map external users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The Text- Delimited source items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. Click **Next**, review your settings, and then go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the text-delimited connector

After you create the Text- Delimited connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **Text- Delimited** connector to display the flyout page. This page contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments or items that are larger than 10 MB. Support for larger items will be available at a later date.
