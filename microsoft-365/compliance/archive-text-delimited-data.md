description: "Admins can set up a connector to import and archive text-delimited data from Globanet into Microsoft 365. This lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Microsoft 365 so you can use compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage your organization's third-party data."

# Set up a connector to archive text-delimited data (preview)

Use a Globanet connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import and archive text-delimited data to user mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. [Globanet](https://globanet.com/merge1/) provides a Text-Delimited connector that is configured to capture items from a third-party data source (on a regular basis) and import those items to Microsoft 365. The connector converts content from the text-delimited data source to an email message format and then imports those items to the user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

After text-delimited data is stored in user mailboxes, you can apply Microsoft 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, eDiscovery, retention policies and retention labels, and communication compliance. Using a Zoom Meetings connector to import and archive data in Microsoft 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.

Once archived, the Text-Delimited source communications can be retained, supervised for compliance, and retrieved for eDiscovery and internal Information Governance.

## Overview of archiving the Text-Delimited source

The following overview explains the process of using a connector to archive the Text-Delimited source information in Microsoft 365.

![Archiving workflow for text-delimited data](../media/TextDelimitedConnectorWorkflow.png)

1. Your organization works with the Text-Delimited source to set up and configure a Text-Delimited site.

2. Once every 24 hours, chat messages from the Text-Delimited source are copied to the Globanet Merge1 site. The connector also converts the content to an email message format.

3. The Text-Delimited connector that you create in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, connects to the Globanet Merge1 site every day and transfers the messages to a secure Azure Storage location in the Microsoft cloud.

4. The connector imports the converted message items to the mailboxes of specific users using the value of the *Email* property of the automatic user mapping as described in Step 3. A new subfolder in the Inbox folder named **Text- Delimited** will be created in the user mailboxes, and the message items will be imported to that folder. The connector does this by using the value of the *Email* property. Every message contains this property, which is populated with the email address of every participant of the message.

## Before you begin

- Create a Globanet Merge1 account by accepting the terms and conditions for the Text-Delimited connector. To do this, contact [Globanet Customer Support](https://globanet.com/contact-us). You need to sign into this account when you create the connector in Step 1.

- The user who creates the Text-Delimited connector in Step 1 (and completes it in Step 3) must be assigned to the Mailbox Import Export role in Exchange Online. This role is required to add connectors on the **Data connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. By default, this role is not assigned to any role group in Exchange Online. You can add the Mailbox Import Export role to the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. Or you can create a role group, assign the Mailbox Import Export role, and then add the appropriate users as members. For more information, see the [Create role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#create-role-groups) or [Modify role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups#modify-role-groups) sections in the article "Manage role groups in Exchange Online".

## Step 1: Set up the Text-Delimited connector

The first step is to access to the **Data Connectors** page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and create a connector for text-delimited data.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) and then click **Data connectors** > **Text-Delimited**.

2. On the **Text-Delimited** product description page, click **Add connector**.

3. On the **Terms of service** page, click **Accept**.

4. Enter a unique name that identifies the connector, and then click **Next**.

5. Sign in to your Merge1 account to configure the connector.

## Step 2: Configure the Text-delimited connector on the Globanet Merge1 site

The second step is to configure the Text-Delimited connector in the Merge1 site. For information about configuring  the Text-Delimited connector on the Globanet Merge1 site, see [Merge1 Third-Party Connectors User Guide](https://docs.ms.merge1.globanetportal.com/Merge1%20Third-Party%20Connectors%20Text-Delimited%20User%20Guide%20.pdf).

After you click **Save & Finish**, you are returned to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, to the **User mapping** page of the connector wizard.

## Step 3: Map users and complete the connector setup

To map users and complete the connector setup in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, follow these steps:

1. On the **Map external users to Microsoft 365 users** page, enable automatic user mapping. The Text- Delimited source items include a property called *Email*, which contains email addresses for users in your organization. If the connector can associate this address with a Microsoft 365 user, the items are imported to that userâ€™s mailbox.

2. On the **Admin Consent** page, click the **Provide Consent** button. You will be redirected to the Microsoft site. Click **Accept** to provide the consent.

   Your organization must consent to allow the Office 365 Import service to access mailbox data in your organization. To provide admin consent, you must be signed in with the credentials of a Microsoft 365 global admin, and then accept the consent request. If you aren't signed in as a global admin, you can go to [this page](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=570d0bec-d001-4c4e-985e-3ab17fdc3073&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com/&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent) and sign in using global admin credentials to accept the request.

3. Click **Next**, review your settings, and then go to the **Data connectors** page to see the progress of the import process for the new connector.

## Step 4: Monitor the text-delimited connector

After you create the Text- Delimited connector, you can view the connector status in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

1. Go to [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) and click **Data connectors** in the left nav.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab and then select the **Text- Delimited** connector to display the flyout page, which contains the properties and information about the connector.

3. Under **Connector status with source**, click the **Download log** link to open (or save) the status log for the connector. This log contains information about the data that has been imported to the Microsoft cloud.

## Known issues

- At this time, we don't support importing attachments larger than 10 MB but support for larger items will be available at a later date.
