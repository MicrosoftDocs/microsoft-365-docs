# Azure Machine Learning web service API key (preview) 

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

This SIT is also included in the [All credentials](sit-defn-all-creds.md) bundled SIT.

 ## Format

A combination of 88 characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters ending in two equals signs (==).

## Pattern

Any combination of 86 characters:

- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- forward slashes (/)
- or plus signs (+)

for example:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDEabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE==`

## Credential example 

`host: account.azureml.net/services/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdef012345/workspaces/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdef012345/; apikey: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDEabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE==;`

## Checksum

No

SITs that have checksums use a unique calculation to check if the information is valid. This means when the **Checksum** value is **Yes**, the service can make a positive detection based on the sensitive data alone. When the **Checksum** value is **No** additional (secondary) elements must also be detected  for the service to make a positive detection.

## Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used to connect to [Azure Machine Learning Web services](/azure/machine-learning/classic/consume-web-services). 

It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of Base64 encoded 512-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName, ID, AccountName.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
- A dictionary of vocabulary.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
