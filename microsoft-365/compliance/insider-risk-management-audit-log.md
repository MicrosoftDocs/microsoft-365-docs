# Insider risk management audit log

The insider risk management audit log enables you to stay informed on the actions that were taken on insider risk management features. This log allows independent review of the actions taken by users assigned to one or more insider risk management role groups. The insider risk management audit log is automatically enabled in your organization and cannot be disabled.

The audit log is automatically and immediately updated whenever monitored activities occur and the log retains information about the activity for 180 days (about six months). After 180 days, the data for the activity is permanently deleted from the log.

Areas included in activity monitoring include:

- Policies
- Cases
- Alerts
- Settings
- Users
- Notice templates

To view and export data from the audit log, users must be assigned to the *Insider Risk Management* or *Insider Risk Management Auditors* role groups. To learn more about insider risk management role groups, see [Getting started with insider risk management Step 1: Enabling permissions](insider-risk-management-configure.md#step-1-enable-permissions-for-insider-risk-management).

> [!NOTE]
> The insider risk management audit log isn't associated with the Microsoft 365 audit log, they are independent auditing systems and capture information on separate activities. Disabling Microsoft 365 auditing doesn't impact activity auditing within insider risk management.

## View activity in the insider risk audit log

To view feature activity monitored for insider risk management, navigate to, and select the **Insider risk audit log** link in the top-right area of any insider risk management tab. By default, you'll see the following information displayed for insider risk management activities:

- **Activity:** A description of the activity taken within the insider risk management solution by a user.
- **Category:** The area or item where the activity was performed. For example, you'll see *Policies* as the category when policy change activities were performed.
- **Activity performed by:** The user name of the user that performed the activity.
- **Date:** The date and time the activity was performed. The date and time are the local date and time for your organization.

For more information about a logged activity, select the activity to display the activity details pane. This pane includes additional information about the activity.

## Columns and filtering

To make it easier for auditors to review logged activity, filtering is supported in the **Insider risk audit log**. For basic filtering, queue columns are available to add to the view to provide different pivots on the files and messages. You can filter activities by the **Category, Date range,** and **Activity performed by** fields.

To add or remove column headings for the activity queue, use the **Customize columns** control and select from the column options. These columns map to common conditions supported in the **Insider risk audit log** and are listed later in this article.

Users assigned to the *Insider Risk Management* or *Insider Risk Management Auditors* role groups can export all activity in the audit log to a .csv (comma-separated values) file by selecting **Export** on the **Insider risk audit log** page.
