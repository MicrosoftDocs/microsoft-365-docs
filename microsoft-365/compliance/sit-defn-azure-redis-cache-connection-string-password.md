# Azure Redis cache connection string password

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

This SIT is also included in the [All credentials](sit-defn-all-creds.md) bundled SIT.

 ## Format

A combination of up to 20,000-characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

or

A combination of 44-characters consisting of letters, digits, and special characters.

## Pattern

Any combination of up to 20,000 characters consisting of: 
 
- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- forward slashes (/)
- or plus signs (+)
- Up to 2
- equal signs (=)

for example: 

`MIIKcQIBAzCCCi0GCSqGSIb3DQEHAaCCCh4EggoaMIIKFjCCBg8GCSqGSIb3DQEHAaCCBgAEggX8MIIF+DCCBfQGCyqGSIb3DQEM`

or

Any combination of 43 characters consisting of:

- a-z (not case-sensitive)
- 0-9
- forward slashes (/)
- or plus signs (+)
- ends with an equal sign (=)

for example:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE=`

## Credential example 

`HostName=account.redis.cache.windows.net;Password=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ABCDE=`

## Checksum

Yes

SITs that have checksums use a unique calculation to check if the information is valid. This means when the **Checksum** value is **Yes**, the service can make a positive detection based on the sensitive data alone. When the **Checksum** value is **No** additional (secondary) elements must also be detected  for the service to make a positive detection.

## Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information thatâ€™s used to connect to [Azure Cache for Redis servers](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/). 

It uses several primary resources:

- Patterns of Base64 encoded string literal.
- Patterns of Base64 encoded 256-bits symmetric key.
- Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName, ID.
- Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
- A dictionary of vocabulary.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence. The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples. Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
