# Load non-Office 365 data into evidence

Not all documents that you may need to analyze in a data investigation will be located in Office 365. With the Non-Office 365 content import feature you can upload documents that don't live in Office 365 into evidence so they can be analyzed in a data investigation.

>[!Note]
>Data investigation requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5.

## Before you begin

Using the upload Non-Office 365 feature as described in this procedure requires that you have:

- An Office 365 E3 with Advanced Compliance add-on or E5 subscription.

- All custodians whose non-Office 365 content will be uploaded must have E3 with Advanced Compliance add-on or E5 licenses.

- An existing eDiscovery case.

- All the files for uploading gathered into folders where there is one folder per custodian and the folders' name is in this format *alias@domainname*. The *alias@domainname* must be users Office 365 alias and domain. You can collect all the *alias@domainname* folders into a root folder. The root folder can only contain the *alias@domainname* folders, there must be no loose files in the root folder.

- An account that is either an eDiscovery Manager or eDiscovery Administrator
Microsoft Azure Storage Tools installed on a computer that has access to the non-Office 365 content folder structure.

- Install AzCopy, which you can do from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy

## Upload non-Office 365 content in to a data investigation

1. Open ****Data Investigations**, then the investigation that the non-Office 365 data will be uploaded to.  Click the **Evidence** tab, then select the evidence set you wish to load the Non-Office 365 data to.  If you have not already created an evidence set, you can do so now.  Finally, click **Manage evidence** then **View uploads** in the Non-Office 365 data section

2. Click the **Upload files** button to start the Non-Office 365 data import wizard.

3. The first step in the wizard simply prepares a secure Azure blob for the files to be uploaded.  After the preparation is complete, click the **Next: Upload files** button.

4. In the **Upload files** step, specify the **Path to location of files**, this is where the Non-Office 365 data you plan on importing is located.  Setting the correct location ensures the AzCopy command is properly updated.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not already installed AzCopy, you can do this from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy

5. Copy the predefined command by clicking the **Copy to clipboard** link. Start a windows command prompt, paste the command and press enter.  The files will be uploaded to the secure Azure blob storage for the next step.

6. Finally, return back to the Security & Compliance and click the **Next: Process files** button.  This initiates processing, text extraction, and indexing of the uploaded files.  You can track the progress of processing here or in the **Jobs** tab.  Once completed, the new files are available in the evidence set.  After processing is complete, you can dismiss the wizard.
