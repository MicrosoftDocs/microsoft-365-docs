# Restore an inactive mailbox in Office 365

An inactive mailbox (which is a type of soft-deleted mailbox) is used to retain a former employee's email after he or she leaves your organization. If another employee takes on the job responsibilities of the departed employee or if that employee returns to your organization, there are two ways that you can make the contents of the inactive mailbox available to a user:
  
- **Restore an inactive mailbox** If another employee takes on the job responsibilities of the departed employee, or if another user needs access to the contents of the inactive mailbox, you can restore (or merge) the contents of the inactive mailbox to an existing mailbox. You can also restore the archive from an inactive mailbox. After it's restored, the inactive mailbox is preserved and is retained as an inactive mailbox. This topic describes the procedures for restoring an inactive mailbox.

- **Recover an inactive mailbox** If the departed employee returns to your organization, or if a new employee is hired to take on the job responsibilities of the departed employee, you can recover the contents of the inactive mailbox. This method converts the inactive mailbox to a new mailbox that contains the contents of the inactive mailbox. After it's recovered, the inactive mailbox no longer exists. For the step-by-step procedures, see [Recover an inactive mailbox in Office 365](recover-an-inactive-mailbox.md).

See the **More information** section in this article for more details about the differences between restoring and recovering an inactive mailbox.
  
## Before you begin

- You have to use Exchange Online PowerShell to restore an inactive mailbox. You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC). For step-by-step instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396554).

- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell to get identity information for the inactive mailboxes in your organization.

    ```powershell
    Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly | FL Name,DistinguishedName,ExchangeGuid,PrimarySmtpAddress
    ```

     Use the information returned by this command to restore a specific inactive mailbox.

- For more information about inactive mailboxes, see [Inactive mailboxes in Office 365](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md).

## Restore an inactive mailbox

Use the **New-MailboxRestoreRequest** cmdlet with the  _SourceMailbox_ and  _TargetMailbox_ parameters to restore the contents of an inactive mailbox to an existing mailbox. For more information about using this cmdlet, see [New-MailboxRestoreRequest](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856298).
  
1. Create a variable that contains the properties of the inactive mailbox.

    ```powershell
    $InactiveMailbox = Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <identity of inactive mailbox>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In the previous command, use the value of the **DistinguishedName** or **ExchangeGUID** property to identify the inactive mailbox. These properties are unique for each mailbox in your organization, whereas it's possible that an active and an inactive mailbox might have the same primary SMTP address.
  
2. Restore the contents of the inactive mailbox to an existing mailbox. The contents of the inactive mailbox (source mailbox) will be merged into the corresponding folders in the existing mailbox (target mailbox).

    ```powershell
    New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox $InactiveMailbox.DistinguishedName -TargetMailbox newemployee@contoso.com -AllowLegacyDNMismatch
    ```

   Alternatively, you can specify a top-level folder in the target mailbox in which to restore the contents from the inactive mailbox. If the specified target folder or target folder structure doesn't already exist in the target mailbox, it is created during the restore process. 

    This example copies mailbox items and subfolders from an inactive mailbox to a folder named "Inactive Mailbox" in the top-level folder structure of the target mailbox.

   ```powershell
   New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox $InactiveMailbox.DistinguishedName -TargetMailbox newemployee@contoso.com -TargetRootFolder "Inactive Mailbox" -AllowLegacyDNMismatch
   ```
  
## Restore the archive from an inactive mailbox

If an inactive mailbox has an archive mailbox, you can also restore it to the archive mailbox of an existing mailbox. To restore the archive from an inactive mailbox, you have to add the  _SourceIsArchive_ and  _TargetIsAchive_ switches to the command used to restore an inactive mailbox. 
  
1. Create a variable that contains the properties of the inactive mailbox.

    ```powershell
    $InactiveMailbox = Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <identity of inactive mailbox>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In the previous command, use the value of the **DistinguishedName** or **ExchangeGUID** property to identify the inactive mailbox. These properties are unique for each mailbox in your organization, whereas it's possible that an active and an inactive mailbox might have the same primary SMTP address. 
  
2. Restore the contents of the archive from the inactive mailbox (source archive) to the archive of an existing mailbox (target archive). In this example, the contents from the source archive are copied to a folder named "Inactive Mailbox Archive" in the archive of the target mailbox.

    ```powershell
    New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox $InactiveMailbox.DistinguishedName -SourceIsArchive -TargetMailbox newemployee@contoso.com -TargetIsArchive -TargetRootFolder "Inactive Mailbox Archive" -AllowLegacyDNMismatch
    ```

## More information

- **What's the main difference between recovering and restoring an inactive mailbox?** When you recover an inactive mailbox, the mailbox is basically converted to a new mailbox, the contents and folder structure of the inactive mailbox are retained, and the mailbox is linked to a new user account. After it's recovered, the inactive mailbox no longer exists, and any changes made to the content in the new mailbox will affect the content that was originally on hold in the inactive mailbox. Conversely, when you restore an inactive mailbox, the contents are merely copied to another mailbox. The inactive mailbox is preserved and remains an inactive mailbox. Any changes made to the content in the target mailbox won't affect the original content held in the inactive mailbox. The inactive mailbox can still be searched by using the [Content Search tool](run-a-content-search-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md) in the Security & Compliance Center, its contents can be restored to another mailbox, or it can be recovered or deleted at a later date.

- **How do you find inactive mailboxes?** To get a list of the inactive mailboxes in your organization and display information that is useful for restoring an inactive mailbox, you can run this command.

  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly | FL Name,PrimarySMTPAddress,DistinguishedName,ExchangeGUID,LegacyExchangeDN,ArchiveStatus
  ```

- **Use a Litigation Hold or Office 365 retention policy to retain inactive mailbox content.** If you want to retain the state of an inactive mailbox after it's restored, you can place the target mailbox on [Litigation Hold](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856286) or apply an [Office 365 retention policy](retention-policies.md) before you restore the inactive mailbox. This will prevent the permanent deletion of any items from the inactive mailbox after they're restored to the target mailbox.

- **Enable retention hold on the target mailbox before you restore an inactive mailbox.** Because mailbox items from an inactive mailbox could be old, you might consider enabling retention hold on the target mailbox before you restore an inactive mailbox. When you put a mailbox on retention hold, the retention policy that's assigned to it won't be processed until the retention hold is removed or until the retention hold period expires. This gives the owner of the target mailbox time to manage old messages from the inactive mailbox. Otherwise, the retention policy might delete old items (or move items to the archive mailbox, if it's enabled) that have expired based on the retention settings configured for the target mailbox. For more information, see [Place a mailbox on retention hold in Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856300).

- **What does the AllowLegacyDNMismatch switch do?** In the previous examples to restore an inactive mailbox, the **AllowLegacyDNMismatch** switch is used to allow restoring the inactive mailbox to a different target mailbox. In a typical restore scenario, the goal is to restore content where the source and target mailboxes are the same mailbox. So by default, the **New-MailboxRestoreRequest** cmdlet checks to make sure that the value of the **LegacyExchangeDN** property on the source and target mailboxes is the same. This helps prevents you from accidentally restoring a source mailbox into the wrong target mailbox. If you try to restore an inactive mailbox without using the **AllowLegacyDNMismatch** switch, the command might fail if the source and target mailboxes have different values for the **LegacyExchangeDN** property.

- **You can use other parameters with the New-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet to implement different restore scenarios for inactive mailboxes.** For example, you can run this command to restore the archive from the inactive mailbox into the primary mailbox of the target mailbox. 

  ```powershell
  New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox <inactive mailbox> -SourceIsArchive -TargetMailbox <target mailbox> -TargetRootFolder "Inactive Mailbox Archive" -AllowLegacyDNMismatch
  ```

  You can also restore the inactive primary mailbox into the archive of the target mailbox by running this command.

  ```powershell
  New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox <inactive mailbox> -TargetMailbox <target mailbox> -TargetIsArchive -TargetRootFolder "Inactive Mailbox" -AllowLegacyDNMismatch
  ```

- **What does the TargetRootFolder parameter do?** As previously explained, you can use the **TargetRootFolder** parameter to specify a folder in the top of the folder structure (also called the root) in the target mailbox in which to restore the contents of the inactive mailbox. If you don't use this parameter, mailbox items from the inactive mailbox are merged into the corresponding default folders of the target mailbox, and custom folders are re-created in the root of the target mailbox. The following illustrations highlight these differences between not using and using the **TargetRootFolder** parameter.
