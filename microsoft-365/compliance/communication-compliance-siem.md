# Use communication compliance with SIEM solutions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance (for example, SEC or FINRA) and business conduct violations such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

[Communication compliance](/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance) is an insider risk solution in Microsoft Purview that helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect, capture, and act on potentially inappropriate messages in your organization. Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions such as [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sentinel) or [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) are commonly used to aggregate and track threats within an organization.

A common need for organizations is to integrate communication compliance alerts and their SIEM solutions. With this integration, organizations can view communication compliance alerts in their SIEM solution and then remediate alerts within the communication compliance workflow and user experience.

For example, an employee sends an offensive message to another employee and that message is detected by a communication compliance policy for potentially inappropriate content. Events such as this are tracked in Microsoft 365 Audit (also known as "unified audit log") by the communication compliance solution and are then imported into the SIEM solution. Alerts triggered in the SIEM solution that are included in the Microsoft 365 Audit are then associated with communication compliance alerts. Investigators are notified of these alerts in their SIEM solution, and then they can then investigate and remediate the corresponding alerts in the communication compliance dashboard.

## Communication compliance alerts in Microsoft 365 Audit

All communication compliance policy matches are captured in Microsoft 365 Audit. The following examples show the details available for selected communication compliance policy match activities:

**Example of audit log entry for an Inappropriate Content policy template match:**

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, there may be up to a 24-hour delay between the time a policy match is recorded in Microsoft 365 Audit and the time in which you can investigate policy matches in communication compliance.

## Configure communication compliance and Microsoft Sentinel integration

When you're using the Microsoft Sentinel to aggregate communication compliance policy matches, Sentinel uses Microsoft 365 Audit as the data source. To integrate communication compliance alerts with Sentinel, complete the following steps:

1. [Onboard to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard). As part of the onboarding process, you'll configure your data sources.
2. Configure the Microsoft Sentinel [Microsoft Office 365 data connector](/azure/sentinel/data-connectors-reference#microsoft-office-365) and under connector configuration, select *Exchange*.
3. Configure search query to retrieve communication compliance alerts. For example:

    *| OfficeActivity
    | where OfficeWorkload == "Exchange" and Operation == "SupervisionRuleMatch"
    | sort by TimeGenerated*

    To filter for a specific user, you would use the following query format:

    *| OfficeActivity
    | where OfficeWorkload == "Exchange" and Operation == "SupervisionRuleMatch" and UserId == "User1@Contoso.com"
    | sort by TimeGenerated*

For more information about the Microsoft 365 Audit logs for Office 365 collected by Microsoft Sentinel, see [Azure Monitor Logs reference](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/OfficeActivity).

## Configure communication compliance and Splunk integration

To integrate communication compliance alerts with Splunk, complete the following steps:

1. Install the [Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/MSO365/ConfigureinputsmanagementAPI)
2. Configure an integration application in Azure AD for the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365
3. Configure search queries in your Splunk solution. Use the following search example to identify all communication compliance alerts:

    *index=\* sourcetype="o365:management:activity" Workload=Exchange Operation=SupervisionRuleMatch*

To filter results for a specific communication compliance policy, you can use the *SRPolicyMatchDetails.SRPolicyName* parameter.

For example, the following search example would return alerts for matches to a communication compliance policy named *Inappropriate content*:

  *index=\* sourcetype='o365:management:activity' Workload=Exchange Operation=SupervisionRuleMatch SRPolicyMatchDetails.SRPolicyName=\<Inappropriate content\>*

The following table shows sample search results for different policy types:

| Policy types | Example search results |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Policy detecting a custom sensitive information type keyword list | { <br> CreationTime: 2022-09-17T16:29:57 <br> ID: 4b9ce23d-ee60-4f66-f38d-08d979f8631f <br> IsPolicyHit: true <br> ObjectId: <CY1PR05MB27158B96AF7F3AFE62E1F762CFDD9@CY1PR05MB2715.namprd05.prod.outlook.com> <br> Operation: SupervisionRuleMatch <br> OrganizationId: d6a06676-95e8-4632-b949-44bc00f0793f <br> RecordType: 68 <br> ResultStatus: {"ItemClass":"IPM.Note","CcsiResults":"leak"} <br> SRPolicyMatchDetails: { [+] } <br> UserId: user1@contoso.OnMicrosoft.com <br> UserKey: SupervisionStoreDeliveryAgent <br> UserType: 0 <br> Version: 1 <br> Workload: Exchange <br> } |
| Policy detecting potentially inappropriate language | { <br> CreationTime: 2022-09-17T23:44:35 <br> ID: e0ef6f54-9a52-4e4c-9584-08d97a351ad0 <br> IsPolicyHit: true <br> ObjectId: <BN6PR05MB3571AD9FBB85C4E12C1F66B4CCDD9@BN6PR05MB3571.namprd05.prod.outlook.com> <br> Operation: SupervisionRuleMatch <br> OrganizationId: d6a06676-95e8-4632-b949-44bc00f0793f <br> RecordType: 68 <br> ResultStatus: {"ItemClass":"IPM.Yammer.Message","CcsiResults":""} <br> SRPolicyMatchDetails: { [+] } <br> UserId: user1@contoso.com <br> UserKey: SupervisionStoreDeliveryAgent <br> UserType: 0 <br> Version: 1 <br> } |

## Configure communication compliance with other SIEM solutions

To retrieve communication compliance policy matches from Microsoft 365 Audit, you can either use PowerShell or the [Office 365 Management API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference).

When using PowerShell, you can use either of these parameters with the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** cmdlet to filter audit log events for communication compliance activities.

| Audit log parameter | Communication compliance parameter value |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Operations          | SupervisionRuleMatch                     |
| RecordType          | ComplianceSupervisionExchange            |

For example, the following is a sample search using the **Operations** parameter and the *SupervisionRuleMatch* value:

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -Operations SupervisionRuleMatch | ft CreationDate,UserIds,AuditData
```

The following is a sample search using the **RecordsType** parameter and the *ComplianceSupervisionExchange* value:

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType ComplianceSuperVisionExchange | ft CreationDate,UserIds,AuditData
```
