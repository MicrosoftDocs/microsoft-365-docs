# Search for and find personal data

Personal data is defined very broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person that is a resident of the European Union (EU).

Article 4 – Definitions

> ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

This article demonstrates how to find personal data stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business (which includes the sites for all Office 365 groups and Microsoft Teams).

Finding personal data subject to GDPR relies on using sensitive information types in Office 365. These define how the automated process recognizes specific information types such as health service numbers and credit card numbers. At this time these cannot be used to find data in Exchange mailboxes at rest. However, sensitive information types can be used with data loss prevention policies to find personal data in mail while in transit.

So, while you can’t currently use Content Search to find personal data at rest in Exchange Online mailboxes, you can use the sensitive information types you curate for GDPR to find and protect personal information as it is sent through email.

## Use Content Search to find personal data

Microsoft recommends a three-stage approach to finding personal data in Office 365. The rest of this topic provides guidance for each of these stages.

## Search for sensitive information types using Content Search

Begin searching for personal data by using the sensitive information types that are included with Office 365. These are listed under Classification in the security center and compliance center.

This topic includes a list of some sensitive information types that apply to citizens in the European Union. Check the security center or the compliance center for new additions that can help with GDPR compliance.

Also see this article: [List of sensitive information types and what each one looks for](https://support.office.com/article/What-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for-fd505979-76be-4d9f-b459-abef3fc9e86b).

Sensitive information types define how the automated process recognizes specific information types such as bank account numbers, health service numbers, and credit card numbers. Sensitive information types are also referred to as conditions. A sensitive information type is defined by a pattern that can be identified by a regular expression or a function. In addition, corroborative evidence such as keywords and checksums can be used to identify a sensitive information type. Confidence level and proximity are also used in the evaluation process.

At this time sensitive information types cannot be used to find data at rest in mailboxes.

## Add parameters to a sensitive information type query to hone the results

You can add these parameters to a sensitive information type query:

-   Count range — define the number of occurrences of sensitive information a document needs to contain before it’s included in the query results.

-   Confidence range — the level of confidence that the detected sensitive type is actually a match, such as 85 (85%).

Syntax:

-   SensitiveType:”\<type\>|\<count range\>|\<confidence range\>”

Examples:

-   SensitiveType:“Credit Card Number|5” (return only documents that contain exactly five credit card numbers)

-   SensitiveType:“Credit Card Number|\*|85..” (confidence range is 85 percent or higher)

Note: “SensitiveType” is case sensitive, but the rest of the query is not.

You can also use properties, and operators to illustrate how you can refine your queries.
