# Enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

You cannot apply [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) in Office on the web before you enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive. You also will not see the **Sensitivity** button on the ribbon, or the applied label name on the status bar. In addition, if you use desktop apps to label your files and then save them on SharePoint or OneDrive, the service can't process the content of these files if the label applied encryption. Coauthoring, eDiscovery, Data Loss Prevention, search, and other collaborative features won't work under these circumstances.

When you do enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, all these capabilities are enabled. In addition to displaying sensitivity labels to users, for new and changed files that have a sensitivity label applied that includes encryption with a cloud-based key:

- SharePoint recognizes sensitivity labels applied to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files in SharePoint and OneDrive: While the file is stored in SharePoint, the encryption from Azure Information Protection is removed so that the file contents can be processed. For information about how documents are protected while they are stored in SharePoint, see [Data Encryption in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online](data-encryption-in-odb-and-spo.md).

- When you download or access this file from SharePoint or OneDrive, the sensitivity label and any encryption settings from the label are reapplied with the file, and these settings remain enforced wherever the file is saved. Because of this behavior, ensure you provide user guidance to use only labels to protect documents. For more information, see [Information Rights Management (IRM) options and sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#information-rights-management-irm-options-and-sensitivity-labels).

- For SharePoint to remove the encryption from the file on upload, the user who uploads the labeled and encrypted file must have usage rights to at least view the file. SharePoint doesn't remove encryption from files if the user can't open them outside SharePoint.

- Use Office on the web (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) to open and edit Office files that have sensitivity labels that apply encryption. The permissions that were assigned with the encryption are enforced. With Word on the web, you can also use auto-labeling when you edit these documents.

- External users can access documents that are labeled with encryption by using guest accounts. For more information, see [Support for external users and labeled content](sensitivity-labels-office-apps.md#support-for-external-users-and-labeled-content). 

- Office 365 eDiscovery supports full-text search for these files. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies cover content in these files.

> [!NOTE]
> If encryption hasn't been applied with a cloud-based key but an on-premises key, a key management topology often referred to as "hold your own key" (HYOK), the SharePoint behavior for processing the file contents doesn't change.
>
> The SharePoint behavior also doesn't change for existing labeled and encrypted files in SharePoint. For these files to benefit from the new capabilities, they must be either downloaded and uploaded, or edited after you run the command to enable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive. For example, they will then be returned in search and eDiscovery results.

After you enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, three new [audit events](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#sensitivity-label-activities) are available for monitoring sensitivity labels that are applied to documents in SharePoint and OneDrive:
- **Applied sensitivity label to file**
- **Changed sensitivity label applied to file**
- **Removed sensitivity label from file**

Watch the following video (no audio) to see the new capabilities in action:

You always have the choice to disable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive ([opt-out](#how-to-disable-sensitivity-labels-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-opt-out) at any time.

If you are currently protecting documents in SharePoint by using SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM), be sure to check the [SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM) and sensitivity labels](#sharepoint-information-rights-management-irm-and-sensitivity-labels) section on this page. 

## Requirements

These new capabilities work with [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) only. If you currently have Azure Information Protection labels, first migrate them to sensitivity labels so that you can enable these features for new files that you upload. For instructions, see [How to migrate Azure Information Protection labels to unified sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels)

Use the OneDrive sync app version 19.002.0121.0008 or later on Windows, and version 19.002.0107.0008 or later on Mac. Both these versions were released January 28, 2019, and are currently released to all rings. For more information, see the [OneDrive release notes](https://support.office.com/article/845dcf18-f921-435e-bf28-4e24b95e5fc0). After you enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, users who run an older version of the sync app are prompted to update it.

## Limitations

- SharePoint doesn't automatically apply sensitivity labels to existing files that you've already encrypted using Azure Information Protection labels. Instead, to get the features to work after you enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, complete these tasks:
    
    1. Make sure you have [migrated the Azure Information Protection labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels) to sensitivity labels and [published them](create-sensitivity-labels.md#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy) from the Microsoft 365 compliance center, or equivalent labeling admin center.
    
    2. Download the files and then upload them to SharePoint.

- SharePoint can't process encrypted files when the label that applied the encryption has either of the following [configurations for encryption](encryption-sensitivity-labels.md#configure-encryption-settings):
    - **Let users assign permissions when they apply the label** and the checkbox for **In Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, prompt users to specify permissions** is selected. This setting is sometimes referred to as "user-defined permissions".
    - **User access to content expires** is set to a value other than **Never**.
    
    For labels with either of these encryption configurations, the labels aren't displayed to users in Office on the web. Additionally, the new capabilities can't be used with labeled documents that already have these encryption settings. For example, these documents won't be returned in search results, even if they are updated.

- For an encrypted document that grants edit permissions to a user, copying can't be blocked in the web versions of the Office apps.

- The Azure Information Protection document tracking site is not supported.

- Office desktop apps and mobile apps don't support coauthoring for files that are labeled with encryption. These apps continue to open labeled and encrypted files in exclusive editing mode.

- If an admin changes settings for a published label that's already applied to files downloaded to users' sync client, users might be unable to save changes they make to the file in their OneDrive Sync folder. This scenario applies to files that are labeled with encryption, and also when the label change is from a label that didn't apply encryption to a label that does apply encryption. Users see a [red circle with a white cross icon error](https://support.office.com/article/what-do-the-onedrive-icons-mean-11143026-8000-44f8-aaa9-67c985aa49b3), and they are asked to save new changes as a separate copy. Instead, they can close and reopen the file, or use Office on the web.

- If a labeled document is uploaded to SharePoint and the label applied encryption by using an account from a service principal name, the document can't be opened in Office on the web. Example scenarios include Microsoft Cloud App Security and a file sent to Teams by email.

- Users can experience save problems after going offline or into a sleep mode when instead of using Office for the web, they use the desktop and mobile apps for Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. For these users, when they resume their Office app session and try to save changes, they see an upload failure message with an option to save a copy instead of saving the original file. 

- Documents that have been encrypted in the following ways can't be opened in Office on the web:
    - Encryption that uses an on-premises key ("hold your own key" or HYOK)
    - Encryption that was applied independently from a label, for example, by directly applying a Rights Management protection template.

- If you delete a label that's been applied to a document in SharePoint, rather than remove the label from the applicable label policy, the document when downloaded won't be labeled or encrypted. In comparison, if the labeled document is stored outside SharePoint, the document remains encrypted if the label is deleted. Note that although you might delete labels during a testing phase, it's very rare to delete a label in a production environment.

## How to enable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive (opt-in)

You can enable the new capabilities by using the Microsoft 365 compliance center, or by using PowerShell. As with all tenant-level configuration changes for SharePoint and OneDrive, it takes about 15 minutes for the change to take effect.

### Use the compliance center to enable support for sensitivity labels

This option is the easiest way to enable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive, but you must sign in as a global administrator for your tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) as a global administrator, and navigate to **Solutions** > **Information protection**
    
    If you don't immediately see this option, first select **Show all**. 

2. If you see a message to turn on the ability to process content in Office online files, select **Turn on now**:
    
    ![Turn on now button to enable sensitivity labels for Office Online](../media/sensitivity-labels-turn-on-banner.png)
    
    The command runs immediately and when the page is next refreshed, you no longer see the message or button.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you must use PowerShell to enable these capabilities for all your geo-locations. See the next section for details.

### Use PowerShell to enable support for sensitivity labels

As an alternative to using the compliance center, you can enable support for sensitivity labels by using the [Set-SPOTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) cmdlet from SharePoint Online PowerShell. 

If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you must use PowerShell to enable this support for all your geo-locations.

#### Prepare the SharePoint Online Management Shell

Before you run the PowerShell command to enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, ensure that you're running SharePoint Online Management Shell version 16.0.19418.12000 or later. If you already have the latest version, you can skip to [next procedure](#run-the-powershell-command-to-enable-support-for-sensitivity-labels) to run the PowerShell command.

1. If you have installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell from PowerShell gallery, you can update the module by running the following cmdlet.

    ```PowerShell
    Update-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell
    ```

2. Alternatively, if you have installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell from the Microsoft Download Center, you can also go to **Add or remove programs** and uninstall the SharePoint Online Management Shell.

3. In a web browser, go to the Download Center page and [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

4. Select your language and then click **Download**.

5. Choose between the x64 and x86 .msi file. Download the x64 file if you run the 64-bit version of Windows or the x86 file if you run the 32-bit version. If you don’t know, see [Which version of Windows operating system am I running?](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system)

6. After you have downloaded the file, run the file and follow the steps in the Setup Wizard.

#### Run the PowerShell command to enable support for sensitivity labels

To enable the new capabilities, use the [Set-SPOTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) cmdlet with the *EnableAIPIntegration* parameter:

1. Using a work or school account that has global administrator or SharePoint admin privileges in Microsoft 365, connect to SharePoint. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
    
    Note: If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, use the -Url parameter with [Connect-SPOService](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/connect-sposervice), and specify the SharePoint Online Administration Center site URL for one of your geo-locations.

2. Run the following command and press **Y** to confirm:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -EnableAIPIntegration $true
    ```
3. For Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each of your remaining geo-locations.

## Schedule roll-out after you create or change a sensitivity label

After you create or change a sensitivity label in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, publish it in stages. If you publish labels that haven't fully synchronized, when users apply the labels to files and upload them to SharePoint, the files can’t be opened in the web versions of the Office apps. Search and eDiscovery also don't work for the files.

We recommend that you follow these steps:

1. Publish the new or modified sensitivity label only to one or two people.

2. Wait for at least 24 hours after initial publication. Verify that the label has fully synchronized.

3. Publish the label more broadly.

## SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM) and sensitivity labels

[SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM)](set-up-irm-in-sp-admin-center.md) is an older technology to protect files at the list and library level by applying encryption and restrictions when files are downloaded. This older protection technology is designed to prevent unauthorized users from opening the file while it's outside SharePoint.

In comparison, sensitivity labels provide the protection settings of visual markings (headers, footers, watermarks) in addition to encryption. The encryption settings support the full range of [usage rights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights) to restrict what users can do with the content, and the same sensitivity labels are supported for [many scenarios](get-started-with-sensitivity-labels.md#common-scenarios-for-sensitivity-labels). Using the same protection method with consistent settings across workloads and apps results in a consistent protection strategy.

However, you can use both protection solutions together and the behavior is as follows: 

- If you upload a file with a sensitivity label that applies encryption, the encryption is not removed so for these files, coauthoring, eDiscovery, DLP, and search are not supported.

- If you label a file using Office on the web, any encryption settings from the label are enforced. For these files, coauthoring, eDiscovery, DLP, and search are supported.

- If you download a file that's labeled by using Office on the web, the label is retained and any encryption settings from the label are enforced rather than the IRM restriction settings.

- If you download an Office or PDF file that isn't encrypted with a sensitivity label, IRM settings are applied.

- If you have enabled any of the additional IRM library settings, which includes preventing users from uploading documents that don't support IRM, these settings are enforced.

With this behavior, you can be assured that all Office and PDF files are protected from unauthorized access if they are downloaded, even if they aren't labeled. However, labeled files that are uploaded won't benefit from the new capabilities.

## How to disable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive (opt-out)

If you disable these new capabilities, files that you uploaded after you enabled sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive continue to be protected by the label because the label settings continue to be enforced. When you apply sensitivity labels to new files after you disable these new capabilities, full-text search, eDiscovery, and coauthoring will no longer work.

To disable these new capabilities, you must use PowerShell. Using the SharePoint Online Management Shell and the [Set-SPOTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) cmdlet, specify the same *EnableAIPIntegration* parameter as described in the [Use PowerShell to enable support for sensitivity labels](#use-powershell-to-enable-support-for-sensitivity-labels) section. But this time, set the parameter value to false and press **Y** to confirm:

```PowerShell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableAIPIntegration $false
```

If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you must run this command for each of your geo-locations.

## Next steps

After you've enabled sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive, consider automatically labeling these files by using auto-labeling policies. For more information, see [Apply a sensitivity label to content automatically](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically.md).
