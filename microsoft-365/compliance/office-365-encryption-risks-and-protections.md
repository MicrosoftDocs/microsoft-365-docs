# Encryption Risks and Protections

Microsoft follows a control and compliance framework that focuses on risks to the Microsoft 365 service and to customer data. Microsoft implements a large set of technology and process-based methods (referred to as controls) to mitigate these risks. Identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks via controls is a continuous process. 

The implementation of controls within various layers of our cloud services such as facilities, network, servers, applications, users (such as Microsoft administrators) and data form a defense-in-depth strategy. The key to this strategy is that many different controls are implemented at different layers to protect against the same or similar risk scenarios. This multi-layered approach provides fail-safe protection in case a control fails for some reason.

Some risk scenarios and the currently available encryption technologies that mitigate them are listed below. These scenarios are in many cases also mitigated via other controls implemented in Office 365.

| Encryption Technology | Services | Key Management | Risk Scenario | Value |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BitLocker | Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business | Microsoft | Disks or servers are stolen or improperly recycled. | BitLocker provides a fail-safe approach to protect against loss of data due to stolen or improperly recycled hardware (server/disk). |
| Service encryption | SharePoint Online, Skype for Business, and OneDrive for Business; Exchange Online | Microsoft | Internal or external hacker tries to access individual files/data as a blob. | The encrypted data cannot be decrypted without access to keys. Helps to mitigate risk of a hacker accessing data. |
| Customer Key | SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Exchange Online, and Skype for Business | Customer | N/A (This feature is designed as a compliance feature; not as a mitigation for any risk.) | Helps customers meet internal regulation and compliance obligations, and the ability to leave the service and revoke Microsoft's access to data |
| TLS between Microsoft 365 and clients | Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Skype for Business, Teams, and Yammer | Microsoft, Customer | Man-in-the-middle or other attack to tap the data flow between Microsoft 365 and client computers over Internet. | This implementation provides value to both Microsoft and customers and assures data integrity as it flows between Microsoft 365 and the client. |
| TLS between Microsoft datacenters | Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Skype for Business | Microsoft | Man-in-the-middle or other attack to tap the customer data flow between Microsoft 365 servers located in different Microsoft datacenters. | This implementation is another method to protect data against attacks between Microsoft datacenters. |
| Azure Rights Management (included in Microsoft 365 or Azure Information Protection) | Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business | Customer | Data falls into the hands of a person who should not have access to the data. | Azure Information Protection uses Azure RMS, which provides value to customers by using encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure files and email across multiple devices. Azure RMS provides value to customers where all emails originating from Microsoft 365 that match certain criteria (i.e., all emails to a certain address) can be automatically encrypted before they get sent to another recipient. |
| S/MIME | Exchange Online | Customer | Email falls into the hands of a person who is not the intended recipient. | S/MIME provides value to customers by assuring that email encrypted with S/MIME can only be decrypted by the direct recipient of the email. |
| Office 365 Message Encryption | Exchange Online, SharePoint Online | Customer | Email, including protected attachments, falls in hands of a person either within or outside Microsoft 365 who is not the intended recipient of the email. | OME provides value to customers where all emails originating from Microsoft 365 that match certain criteria (i.e., all emails to a certain address) are automatically encrypted before they get sent to another internal or an external recipient. |
| SMTP TLS with partner organization | Exchange Online | Customer | Email is intercepted via a man-in-the-middle or other attack while in transit from a Microsoft 365 tenant to another partner organization. | This scenario provides value to the customer such that they can send/receive all emails between their Microsoft 365 tenant and their partner's email organization inside an encrypted SMTP channel. |

## Encryption technologies available in multi-tenant environments

| Encryption Technology | Implemented by | Key Exchange Algorithm and Strength | Key Management\* | FIPS 140-2 Validated |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BitLocker | Exchange Online | AES 256-bit | AES external key is stored in a Secret Safe and in the registry of the Exchange server. The Secret Safe is a secured repository that requires high-level elevation and approvals to access. Access can be requested and approved only by using an internal tool called Lockbox. The AES external key is also stored in the Trusted Platform Module in the server. A 48-digit numerical password is stored in Active Directory and protected by Lockbox. | Yes |
|  | SharePoint Online | AES 256-bit | AES external key is stored in a Secret Safe. The Secret Safe is a secured repository that requires high-level elevation and approvals to access. Access can be requested and approved only by using an internal tool called Lockbox. The AES external key is also stored in the Trusted Platform Module in the server. A 48-digit numerical password is stored in Active Directory and protected by Lockbox. | Yes |
|  | Skype for Business | AES 256-bit | AES external key is stored in a Secret Safe. The Secret Safe is a secured repository that requires high-level elevation and approvals to access. Access can be requested and approved only by using an internal tool called Lockbox. The AES external key is also stored in the Trusted Platform Module in the server. A 48-digit numerical password is stored in Active Directory and protected by Lockbox. | Yes |
| Service Encryption | SharePoint Online | AES 256-bit | The keys used to encrypt the blobs are stored in the SharePoint Online Content Database.

These secrets are at the service level for SharePoint Online, not at the tenant level. These secrets (sometimes referred to as the master keys) are stored in a separate secure repository called the Key Store. TDE provides security at rest for both the active database and the database backups and transaction logs. When customers provide the optional key, the customer key is stored in Azure Key Vault, and the service uses the key to encrypt a tenant key, which is used to encrypt a site key, which is then used to encrypt the file level keys. Essentially, a new key hierarchy is introduced when the customer provides a key. | Yes |
|  | Skype for Business | AES 256-bit | Each piece of data is encrypted using a different randomly generated 256-bit key.
