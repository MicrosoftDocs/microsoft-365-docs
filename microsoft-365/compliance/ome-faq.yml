    questions:
      - question: What is Office 365 Message Encryption (OME)?
        answer: OME combines email encryption and rights management capabilities. Rights management capabilities are powered by Azure Information Protection.

      - question: |
          Who can use OME?
        answer: |
          You can use the new capabilities for OME under the following conditions:
            
          - If you have never set up OME or IRM for Exchange Online in Office 365.
          
          - If you have set up OME and IRM, you can use these steps if you are using the Azure Rights Management service from Azure Information Protection.
          
          - If you are using Exchange Online with Active Directory Rights Management service (AD RMS), you can't enable these new capabilities right away. Instead, you need to [migrate AD RMS to Azure Information Protection](/information-protection/plan-design/migrate-from-ad-rms-to-azure-rms) first. When you've finished the migration, you can successfully set up OME.
          
            If you choose to continue to use on-premises AD RMS with Exchange Online instead of migrating to Azure Information Protection, you will not be able to use these new capabilities.
          
      - question:  |
          What subscriptions do I need to use the new OME capabilities?
        answer: |
          To use the new OME capabilities, you need one of the following plans:
          
          - Office 365 Message Encryption is offered as part of Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 and E5, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Office 365 A1, A3, and A5, and Office 365 Government G3 and G5. You don't need additional licenses to receive the new protection capabilities powered by Azure Information Protection.

          - You can also add Azure Information Protection Plan 1 to the following plans to receive the new Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities: Exchange Online Plan 1, Exchange Online Plan 2, Office 365 F1, Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, or Office 365 Enterprise E1.
          
          - Each user benefiting from Office 365 Message Encryption needs to be licensed to be covered by the feature.
          
          - For the full list see the [Exchange Online service descriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description) for Office 365 Message Encryption.
          
      - question:  |
          Can I use Exchange Online with bring your own key (BYOK) in Azure Information Protection?
        answer: |
          Yes! Microsoft recommends that you complete the steps to set up BYOK before you set up OME.
            
          For more information about BYOK, see [Planning and implementing your Azure Information Protection tenant key](/information-protection/plan-design/plan-implement-tenant-key).
            
      - question:  |
          Do OME and BYOK with Azure Information Protection change Microsoft's approach to third-party data requests such as subpoenas?
        answer: |
          No. OME and the option to provide and control your own encryption keys, called BYOK, from Azure Information Protection were not designed to respond to law enforcement subpoenas. OME, with BYOK for Azure Information Protection, was designed for compliance-focused organizations. Microsoft takes third-party requests for customer data seriously. As a cloud service provider, we always advocate for the privacy of your data. In the event we get a subpoena, we always attempt to redirect the third party directly to you to obtain the information. (Read Brad Smith's blog: [Protecting customer data from government snooping](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2013/12/04/protecting-customer-data-from-government-snooping/)). We periodically publish detailed information of the request we receive. For more information regarding third-party data requests, see [Responding to government and law enforcement requests to access customer data](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/privacy/govt-requests-for-data) on the Microsoft Trust Center. Also, see "Disclosure of Customer Data" in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/product-licensing/products.aspx).
            
      - question: |
          How is this feature related to legacy Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) and Information Rights Management (IRM) features?
        answer: |
          The new capabilities for Office 365 Message Encryption are an evolution of the existing IRM and legacy OME solutions. The following table provides more details.
            
          **Comparison of legacy OME, IRM, and new OME capabilities**
          
          | Capability | Previous versions of OME | IRM | New OME capabilities |

The OME portal requires no separate download.|
          |**Bring Your Own Key support**|Not available|Not available| BYOK supported|
          
      - question: |
          How do I enable the new OME capabilities for my organization?
        answer: |
          See [Set up new Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities](set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities.md).
            
      - question: |
          Will the previous version of OME be deprecated?
        answer: |
          You can still use the previous version of OME, it will not be deprecated at this time. However, we highly encourage organizations to use the new and improved OME solution. If you have not already deployed OME, you can't set up a new deployment of the previous version of OME.

      - question: |
          My organization uses Active Directory Rights Management, can I use this functionality?
        answer: |
          No. If you are using Exchange Online with Active Directory Rights Management service (AD RMS), you can't enable these new capabilities right away. Instead, you need to [migrate AD RMS to Azure Information Protection](/information-protection/plan-design/migrate-from-ad-rms-to-azure-rms) first.
            
      - question: |
          My organization has an Exchange Hybrid deployment. Can I use this feature?
        answer: |
          On-premises users can send encrypted mail using Exchange Online mail flow rules. In order to do this, you need to route email through Exchange Online. For more information, see [Part 2: Configure mail to flow from your email server to Microsoft 365](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/set-up-connectors-to-route-mail#part-2-configure-mail-to-flow-from-your-email-server-to-office-365).
            
      - question: |
          What email client do I need to use in order to create an OME encrypted message? What applications are supported for sending protected messages?
        answer: |
          You can create protected messages from Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013 for Windows and Mac, and from Outlook on the web. For more information on sending encrypted messages, see [Send, view, and reply to encrypted messages in Outlook for PC](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-view-and-reply-to-encrypted-messages-in-outlook-for-pc-eaa43495-9bbb-4fca-922a-df90dee51980?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).
            
      - question: |
          What email clients are supported to read and reply to protected emails?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 users can read and respond from Outlook for Windows and Mac (2013 and 2016), Outlook on the web, and Outlook mobile (Android and iOS). You can also use the iOS native mail client if your organization allows it. If you are not a Microsoft 365 user, you can read and reply to encrypted messages on the web through your web browser.

      - question: |
          What email clients support the encrypt-only protected emails?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 users can use Outlook for PC versions 2019 and Microsoft 365 to create mail protected with the encrypt-only policy.  That means messages that have the new encrypt-only policy applied can be read directly in Outlook on the web, in Outlook for iOS and Android, and now Outlook for PC versions 2019 and Microsoft 365.

      - question: |
          Is there a size limit for messages you can send with OME?
        answer: |
          Yes. The maximum message size you can send with OME, including attachments, is 25 MB. For more information, see [Message limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#message-limits-1).
          
      - question: |
          What file types are supported as attachments in protected emails? Do attachments inherit the protection policies associated with protected emails?
        answer: |
          You can attach any file type to a protected mail. With one exception, protection policies are applied only on the file formats mentioned in [File types supported by the Azure Information Protection client](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types). OME does not support the 97-2003 versions of the following Office programs: Word (.doc), Excel (.xls), and PowerPoint (.ppt).
          
          If a file format is supported, such as a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file, the file is always protected, even after the attachment has been downloaded by the recipient. For example, say an attachment is protected by Do Not Forward. The original recipient downloads the file, creates a message to a new recipient and attaches the file. When the new recipient receives the file, the recipient will not be able to open the protected file.
            
      - question: |
          Are PDF file attachments supported?
        answer: |
          The short answer is yes! If enabled, PDF encryption allows you to protect sensitive PDF documents through secure communication or secure collaboration. When you send an email, the Office 365 service encrypts PDF file attachments. The Outlook client doesn't encrypt PDF file attachments.
          
          For Outlook on the web, Outlook for iOS, and Outlook for Android, you can encrypt PDFs you send without any more steps. These clients natively support PDF encryption.
          
          Outlook desktop does not natively support encryption of PDF file attachments. Instead, you'll need to set up Exchange mail flow rules or DLP to apply encryption to PDF attachments first. When you send mail from Outlook Desktop with a PDF attachment, the client sends the message with the attachment to the service first. When the service receives the file, the service applies the OME protection of the data loss prevention (DLP) policy or mail flow rule in Exchange Online. Next, Exchange Online sends the message with the protected PDF file attachment.
          
          To enable encryption for PDF attachments, run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):
          
          ```powershell
          Set-IRMConfiguration -EnablePdfEncryption $true
          ```
          
          PDF encryption allows you to protect sensitive PDF documents through secure communication or secure collaboration. For all Outlook clients, messages and unprotected PDF attachments inherit the OME protection of the data loss prevention (DLP) policy or mail flow rule in Exchange Online. Also, if an Outlook on the web user attaches an unprotected PDF document and applies protection to message, the message inherits the protection of the message. Users can only open the encrypted attachments in applications that support protected PDFs (for example, the OME Portal and the Azure Information Protection Viewer).
          
          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > Outlook desktop client does not support PDF encryption.
          
      - question: |
          Are SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business attachments supported?
        answer: |
          Not yet. SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business attachments are not supported and end-users can encrypt a mail but not the cloud attachments.

      - question: |
          What email clients support preview of encrypted attachments in protected emails?
        answer: |
          When attachments are protected with a protected mail, Outlook clients provide tha ability to preview the document directly. Outlook supports preview of Office documents (docx, xlsx, pptx, doc, xls, ppt). Outlook on the web supports preview of Office documents (docx, xlsx, pptx) and PDF.  

      - question: |
          What email clients support revocation of protected emails?
        answer: |
          Outlook on the web supports revocation of protected mail.  See [How to revoke an encrypted message that you sent](revoke-ome-encrypted-mail.md#how-to-revoke-an-encrypted-message-that-you-sent) for details.
          
      - question: |
          Can I automatically encrypt messages by setting up policies?
        answer: |
          Yes. Use mail flow rules in Exchange Online to automatically encrypt a message based on certain conditions. For example, you can create policies that are based on recipient ID, recipient domain, or on the content in the body or subject of the message. See [Define mail flow rules to encrypt email messages in Office 365](define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email.md).
            
      - question: |
          Can I automatically remove encryption on incoming and outgoing mail?
        answer: |
          Admins can set up a mail flow rule to remove encryption for outgoing mail. You can only set up a rule to remove encryption for incoming mail that originates from your organization.

      - question: |
          Can I automatically encrypt messages by setting up policies in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) through the Microsoft 365 compliance center?
        answer: |
          Yes! You can set up mail flow rules in Exchange Online or by using DLP in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

      - question: |
          Can I customize encrypted messages with my company branding?
        answer: |
          Yes! For information on customizing email messages and the OME portal, see Add your organization's brand to your encrypted messages. See [Add your organization's brand to your encrypted messages](add-your-organization-brand-to-encrypted-messages.md).
            
      - question: |
          Are there any reporting capabilities or insights for encrypted emails?
        answer: |
          There is an Encryption report in the Security and Compliance Center. See [View email security reports in the Security & Compliance Center](../security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports.md).
            
      - question: |
          Can I use message encryption with compliance features such as eDiscovery?
        answer: |
          Yes, most messages protected by OME are discoverable. OME protected mail that you receive from another Microsoft 365 organization that has custom branding applied through a mail flow rule is undiscoverable by your eDiscovery service. In other words, if the mail isn't accessible through the user's mailbox, but rather, surfaced only through a link to the OME portal, the mail isn't searchable. See [eDiscovery activities that support encrypted items](/microsoft-365/compliance/ediscovery-decryption#ediscovery-activities-that-support-encrypted-items) for details.

      - question: |
          Can I remove encryption from email?
        answer: |
          Admins can set up a mail flow rule to remove encryption. You can't remove encryption using a mail flow rule from mail that is applied by another organization.

      - question: |
          Can I send as a shared mailbox and encrypt emails?
        answer: |
          When someone sends an email message that matches an encryption mail flow rule, the message is encrypted before it's sent.

      - question: |
          Can I open encrypted messages sent to a shared mailbox?
        answer: |
          Yes! You can open encrypted messages for a shared mailbox when you're logged into a supported Outlook client.
          
          - Users can open protected mails in a shared mailbox where the shared mailbox received a protected mail as part of a distribution group.
          
          - Users can view attachments that inherit protection from email when they use Outlook for Windows, Outlook for Mac, and Outlook on the web.
          
          The following table lists the supported clients for shared mailboxes.
          
          | Platform | Read mail | View email attachments |
          |----------|-----------|------------------------|
          | Outlook on the web | Yes | Yes                |
          | Outlook for Windows| Yes | Yes                |
          | Outlook for Mac    | Yes | Yes                |
          | Outlook for Android| Yes | No                 |
          | Outlook for iOS    | Yes | No                 |
          |
          
          There are currently two known limitations:
          
          - You can't open attachments to emails that you receive on mobile devices by using Outlook mobile.
          
          - We don't support assignment through an email-enabled security group, because Outlook and Azure Information Protection unified labeling clients require the user to have full access permissions and have automapping enabled. Automapping is enabled by default for Exchange Online.
          
          **To assign a user to the shared mailbox**
          
          1. [Connect to Exchange Online Using Remote PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?v=exchg.150).aspx).
          
          2. Run the Add-MailboxPermission cmdlet with the Automapping parameter. This example gives Ayla full access permissions to a support mailbox.
          
             ```powershell
             Add-MailboxPermission -Identity support@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -User ayla@contoso.com -AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping $true
             ```

      - question: |
          Is delegated access supported with opening encrypted messages? Even if a delegate has full access to another user's mailbox?
        answer: |
          Delegated access of encrypted mail is supported in Outlook on the web, Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, and Outlook for Android.  Outlook for Windows does not support delegated access.

      - question: |
          How long do I have access to the mail in the OME portal?
        answer: |
          You can login to the OME portal to retrieve mail as long as the sender's organization is active and the mail has not been configured to expire.

      - question: |
          What do I do if I don’t receive the one-time pass code after I requested it?
        answer: |
          First, check the junk or spam folder in your email client. DKIM and DMARC settings for your organization may cause these emails to end up filtered as spam.
          
          Next, check quarantine in the Security & Compliance Center. Often, messages containing a one-time pass code, especially the first ones your organization receives, end up in quarantine.
