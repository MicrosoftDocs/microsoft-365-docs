# How to identify the type of hold placed on an Exchange Online mailbox

[!include[Purview banner](../includes/purview-rebrand-banner.md)]

This article explains how to identify holds placed on Exchange Online mailboxes in Microsoft 365.

Microsoft 365 offers several ways that your organization can prevent mailbox content from being permanently deleted. This allows your organization to retain content to meet compliance regulations or during legal and other types of investigations. Here's a list of the retention features (also called *holds*) in Office 365:

- **[Litigation Hold](create-a-litigation-hold.md):** Holds that are applied to user mailboxes in Exchange Online.

- **[eDiscovery hold](create-ediscovery-holds.md):** Holds that are associated with a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) case in the security and compliance center. eDiscovery holds can be applied to user mailboxes and to the corresponding mailbox for Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams.

- **[In-Place Hold](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/create-or-remove-in-place-holds):** Holds that are applied to user mailboxes by using the In-Place eDiscovery & Hold tool in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104" target="_blank">Exchange admin center</a> in Exchange Online. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > In-Place Holds have been retired and you can no longer create In-Place Holds or apply them to mailboxes. However, In-Place Holds might still be applied to mailboxes in your organization, which is why they are included in this article. For more information, see [Retirement of legacy eDiscovery tools](legacy-ediscovery-retirement.md#in-place-ediscovery-and-in-place-holds-in-the-exchange-admin-center).

- **[Microsoft 365 retention policies](retention.md):** Can be configured to retain (or retain and then delete) content in user mailboxes in Exchange Online and in the corresponding mailbox for Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams. You can also create a retention policy to retain Skype for Business Conversations, which are stored in user mailboxes.

  There are two types of Microsoft 365 retention policies that can be assigned to mailboxes.

    - **Specific location retention policies:** These are policies that are assigned to the content locations of specific users. You use the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to get information about retention policies assigned to specific mailboxes. For more information about this type of retention policy, see the section [A policy with specific inclusions or exclusions](retention-settings.md#a-policy-with-specific-inclusions-or-exclusions) from the retention policy documentation.

    - **Organization-wide retention policies:** These are policies that are assigned to all content locations in your organization. You use the **Get-OrganizationConfig** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to get information about organization-wide retention policies. For more information about this type of retention policy, see the section [A policy that applies to entire locations](retention-settings.md#a-policy-that-applies-to-entire-locations) from the retention policy documentation.

- **[Microsoft 365 retention labels](retention.md):** If a user applies a Microsoft 365 retention label (one that's configured to retain content or retain and then delete content) to *any* folder or item in their mailbox, a hold is placed on the mailbox as if the mailbox was placed on Litigation Hold or assigned to a Microsoft 365 retention policy. For more information, see the [Identifying mailboxes on hold because a retention label has been applied to a folder or item](#identifying-mailboxes-on-hold-because-a-retention-label-has-been-applied-to-a-folder-or-item) section in this article.

To manage mailboxes on hold, you may have to identify the type of hold that's placed on a mailbox so that you can perform tasks such as changing the hold duration, temporarily or permanently removing the hold, or excluding a mailbox from a Microsoft 365 retention policy. In these cases, the first step is to identify the type of hold placed on the mailbox. And because multiple holds (and different types of holds) can be placed on a single mailbox, you have to identify all holds placed on a mailbox if you want to remove or change a hold.

## Step 1: Obtain the GUID for holds placed on a mailbox

You can run the following two cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell to get the GUID of the holds that are placed on a mailbox. After you obtain a GUID, you use it to identify the specific hold in Step 2. A Litigation Hold isn't identified by a GUID. Litigation Holds are either enabled or disabled for a mailbox.

- **Get-Mailbox:** Use this cmdlet to determine whether Litigation Hold is enabled for a mailbox and to get the GUIDs for eDiscovery holds, In-Place Holds, and Microsoft 365 retention policies that are specifically assigned to a mailbox. The output of this cmdlet will also indicate if a mailbox has been explicitly excluded from an organization-wide retention policy.

- **Get-OrganizationConfig:** Use this cmdlet to get the GUIDs for organization-wide retention policies.

To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

### Get-Mailbox

Run the following command to get information about the holds and Microsoft 365 retention policies applied to a mailbox.

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <username> | FL LitigationHoldEnabled,InPlaceHolds
```

> [!TIP]
> If there are too many values in the InPlaceHolds property and not all of them are displayed, you can run the `Get-Mailbox <username> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InPlaceHolds` command to display each GUID on a separate line.

The following table describes how to identify different types of holds based on the values in the *InPlaceHolds* property when you run the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet.

| Hold type                                                          | Example value                                                                                  | How to identify the hold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| eDiscovery hold                                                    | `UniH7d895d48-7e23-4a8d-8346-533c3beac15d`                                                     | The *InPlaceHolds property* contains the GUID of any hold associated with an eDiscovery case in the security and compliance center. You can tell this is an eDiscovery hold because the GUID starts with the `UniH` prefix (which denotes a Unified Hold).                                                                                   |
| In-Place Hold                                                      | `c0ba3ce811b6432a8751430937152491` <br/> or <br/> `cld9c0a984ca74b457fbe4504bf7d3e00de`        | The *InPlaceHolds* property contains the GUID of the In-Place Hold that's placed on the mailbox. You can tell this is an In-Place Hold because the GUID either doesn't start with a prefix or it starts with the `cld` prefix.                                                                                                               |

You can identify retention policies because the GUID starts with the `mbx` or the `skp` prefix. The `skp` prefix indicates that the retention policy is applied to Skype for Business conversations in the user's mailbox. |
| Excluded from an organization-wide Microsoft 365 retention policy  | `-mbxe9b52bf7ab3b46a286308ecb29624696`                                                         | If a mailbox is excluded from an organization-wide Microsoft 365 retention policy, the GUID for the retention policy that the mailbox is excluded from is displayed in the InPlaceHolds property and is identified by the `-mbx` prefix.                                                                                                     |

### Get-OrganizationConfig
If the *InPlaceHolds* property is empty when you run the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet, there still may be one or more organization-wide Microsoft 365 retention policies applied to the mailbox. Run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to get a list of GUIDs for organization-wide Microsoft 365 retention policies.

```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | FL InPlaceHolds
```

> [!TIP]
> If there are too many values in the InPlaceHolds property and not all of them are displayed, you can run the `Get-OrganizationConfig | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InPlaceHolds` command to display each GUID on a separate line.

The following table describes the different types of organization-wide holds and how to identify each type based on the GUIDs contained in *InPlaceHolds* property when you run the **Get-OrganizationConfig** cmdlet.

| Hold type                                                                                                | Example value                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Note 1xN chats are stored in the mailbox of the individual chat participants.  |
| Microsoft 365 retention policy applied to Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams channel messages                | `grp1a0a132ee8944501a4bb6a452ec31171:3` | Organization-wide retention policies applied to Microsoft 365 groups and channel messages in Microsoft Teams are identified by GUIDs that start with the `grp` prefix. Note channel messages are stored in the group mailbox that is associated with a Microsoft Team. |

For more information about retention policies applied to Microsoft Teams, see [Learn about retention policies for Microsoft Teams](retention-policies-teams.md).

### Understanding the format of the InPlaceHolds value for retention policies

In addition to the prefix (mbx, skp, or grp) that identifies an item in the InPlaceHolds property as a Microsoft 365 retention policy, the value also contains a suffix that identifies the type of retention action that's configured for the policy. For example, the action suffix is highlighted in bold type in the following examples:

   `skp127d7cf1076947929bf136b7a2a8c36f`**:1**

   `mbx7cfb30345d454ac0a989ab3041051209`**:2**

   `grp1a0a132ee8944501a4bb6a452ec31171`**:3**

The following table defines the three possible retention actions:

| Value | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Indicates that the retention policy is configured to delete items. The policy doesn't retain items.                                  |
| **2** | Indicates that the retention policy is configured to hold items. The policy doesn't delete items after the retention period expires. |
| **3** | Indicates that the retention policy is configured to hold items and then delete them after the retention period expires.             |

For more information about retention actions, see the [Retaining content for a specific period of time](retention-settings.md#retaining-content-for-a-specific-period-of-time) section.
   
## Step 2: Use the GUID to identify the hold

After you obtain the GUID for a hold that is applied to a mailbox, the next step is to use that GUID to identify the hold. The following sections show how to identify the name of the hold (and other information) by using the hold GUID.

### eDiscovery holds

Run the following commands in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell to identify an eDiscovery hold that's applied to the mailbox. Use the GUID (not including the UniH prefix) for the eDiscovery hold that you identified in Step 1. 

To connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell, see [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

The first command creates a variable that contains information about the hold. This variable is used in the other commands. The second command displays the name of the eDiscovery case the hold is associated with. The third command displays the name of the hold and a list of the mailboxes the hold applies to.

```powershell
$CaseHold = Get-CaseHoldPolicy <hold GUID without prefix>
```

```powershell
Get-ComplianceCase $CaseHold.CaseId | FL Name
```

```powershell
$CaseHold | FL Name,ExchangeLocation
```

### In-Place Holds

Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell to identify the In-Place Hold that's applied to the mailbox. Use the GUID for the In-Place Hold that you identified in Step 1. The command displays the name of the hold and a list of the mailboxes the hold applies to.

```powershell
Get-MailboxSearch -InPlaceHoldIdentity <hold GUID> | FL Name,SourceMailboxes
```

If the GUID for the In-Place Hold starts with the `cld` prefix, be sure to include the prefix when running the previous command.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As we continue to invest in different ways to preserve mailbox content, we're announcing the retirement of In-Place Holds in the Exchange admin center (EAC). Starting July 1, 2020 you won't be able to create new In-Place Holds in Exchange Online. But you'll still be able to manage In-Place Holds in the EAC or by using the **Set-MailboxSearch** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell. However, starting October 1, 2020, you won't be able to manage In-Place Holds. You'll only be remove them in the EAC or by using the **Remove-MailboxSearch** cmdlet. For more information about the retirement of In-Place Holds, see [Retirement of legacy eDiscovery tools](legacy-ediscovery-retirement.md).

### Microsoft 365 retention policies

[Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell) and run the following command to identity the Microsoft 365 retention policy (organization-wide or specific location) that's applied to the mailbox. Use the GUID (not including the mbx, skp, or grp prefix or the action suffix) that you identified in Step 1.

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy <hold GUID without prefix or suffix> -DistributionDetail  | FL Name,*Location
```

## Identifying mailboxes on hold because a retention label has been applied to a folder or item

Whenever a user applies a retention label that's configured to *retain* or *retain and then delete* content to any folder or item in their mailbox, the *ComplianceTagHoldApplied* mailbox property is set to **True**. When this happens, the mailbox is treated similarly to if it was placed on hold, such as when assigned to a Microsoft 365 retention policy or placed on Litigation Hold, however with some caveats. When the *ComplianceTagHoldApplied* property is set to **True**, the following things occur:

- If the mailbox or the user's Microsoft 365 account is deleted, the mailbox becomes an [inactive mailbox](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md).
- You aren't able to disable the mailbox (either the primary mailbox or the archive mailbox, if it's enabled).
- Items that have been deleted from the mailbox will follow one of two paths depending on if they are labeled or not:
    - **Unlabeled items** will follow the same path deleted items take when no holds apply to the mailbox.  The time that it takes for these items to be permanently deleted is determined by the [deleted item retention](/exchange/security-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder#deleted-item-retention) configuration and whether [single item recovery](/exchange/security-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder#single-item-recovery) is enabled for the mailbox or not.
    - **Labeled items** will be retained within the [recoverable items folder](/exchange/security-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder#recoverable-items-folder) in the same way they would be if a Microsoft 365 retention policy applied, but at the individual item level.  If multiple items have different labels that are configured to *retain* or *retain and then delete* content at different intervals, each item will be retained based on the configuration of the applied label.
- Other holds, such as Microsoft 365 retention policies, eDiscovery holds or litigation hold can extend how long labeled items are retained based on the [principles of retention](retention.md#the-principles-of-retention-or-what-takes-precedence).

To view the value of the *ComplianceTagHoldApplied* property for a single mailbox, run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <username> | FL ComplianceTagHoldApplied
```

For more information about retention labels, see [retention labels](retention.md#retention-labels).

## Managing mailboxes on delay hold

After any type of hold is removed from a mailbox, a *delay hold* is applied. This means that the actual removal of the hold is delayed for 30 days to prevent data from being permanently deleted (purged) from the mailbox. This gives admins an opportunity to search for or recover mailbox items that will be purged after a hold is removed. A delay hold is placed on a mailbox the next time the Managed Folder Assistant processes the mailbox and detects that a hold was removed. Specifically, a delay hold is applied to a mailbox when the Managed Folder Assistant sets one of the following mailbox properties to **True**:

- **DelayHoldApplied:** This property applies to email-related content (generated by people using Outlook and Outlook on the web) that's stored in a user's mailbox.

- **DelayReleaseHoldApplied:** This property applies to cloud-based content (generated by non-Outlook apps such as Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Forms, and Microsoft Yammer) that's stored in a user's mailbox. Cloud data generated by a Microsoft app is typically stored in a hidden folder in a user's mailbox.

When a delay hold is placed on the mailbox (when either of the previous properties is set to **True**), the mailbox is still considered to be on hold for an unlimited hold duration, as if the mailbox was on Litigation Hold. After 30 days, the delay hold expires, and Microsoft 365 will automatically attempt to remove the delay hold (by setting the DelayHoldApplied or DelayReleaseHoldApplied property to **False**) so that the hold is removed. After either of these properties are set to **False**, the corresponding items that are marked for removal are purged the next time the mailbox is processed by the Managed Folder Assistant.

To view the values for the DelayHoldApplied and DelayReleaseHoldApplied properties for a mailbox, run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <username> | FL *HoldApplied*
```

To remove the delay hold before it expires, you can run one (or both) the following commands in Exchange Online PowerShell, depending on which property you want to change:

```powershell
Set-Mailbox <username> -RemoveDelayHoldApplied
```

Or

```powershell
Set-Mailbox <username> -RemoveDelayReleaseHoldApplied
```

You must be assigned the Legal Hold role in Exchange Online to use the *RemoveDelayHoldApplied* or *RemoveDelayReleaseHoldApplied* parameters. 

To remove the delay hold on an inactive mailbox, run one of the following commands in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-Mailbox <DN or Exchange GUID> -InactiveMailbox -RemoveDelayHoldApplied
```

Or

```powershell
Set-Mailbox <DN or Exchange GUID> -InactiveMailbox -RemoveDelayReleaseHoldApplied
```

> [!TIP]
> The best way to specify an inactive mailbox in the previous command is to use its Distinguished Name or Exchange GUID value. Using one of these values helps prevent accidentally specifying the wrong mailbox. 

For more information about using these parameters for managing delay holds, see [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailbox).

Keep the following things in mind when managing a mailbox on delay hold:

- If either the DelayHoldApplied or DelayReleaseHoldApplied property is set to **True** and a mailbox (or the corresponding user account) is deleted, the mailbox becomes an inactive mailbox. That's because a mailbox is considered to be on hold if either property is set to **True**, and deleting a mailbox on hold results in an inactive mailbox. To delete a mailbox and not make it an inactive mailbox, you have to set both properties to **False**.

- As previous stated, a mailbox is considered to be on hold for an unlimited hold duration if either the DelayHoldApplied or DelayReleaseHoldApplied property is set to **True**. However, that doesn't mean that *all* content in the mailbox is preserved. It depends on the value that's set to each property. For example, let's say both properties are set to **True** because holds are removed from the mailbox. Then you remove only the delay hold that's applied to non-Outlook cloud data (by using the *RemoveDelayReleaseHoldApplied* parameter). The next time the Managed Folder Assistant processes the mailbox, the non-Outlook items marked for removal are purged. Any Outlook items marked for removal won't be purged because the DelayHoldApplied property is still set to **True**. The opposite would also be true: if DelayHoldApplied is set to **False** and DelayReleaseHoldApplied is set to **True**, then only Outlook items marked for removal would be purged.

## How to confirm that an organization-wide retention policy is applied to a mailbox

When an organization-wide retention policy is applied or removed to a mailbox, exporting the mailbox diagnostics logs can help you be certain that Exchange Online has actually applied or removed the retention policy to the mailbox. To view this information, you first need to validate a few things using [Exchange Online Powershell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

### Obtain the GUIDs for any retention policies explicitly applied to a mailbox

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <username> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InPlaceHolds
```

### Obtain the GUIDs for any organization-wide retention policies applied to mailboxes

```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InPlaceHolds
```

### Get the Mailbox Diagnostics for HoldTracking

The Hold Tracking Mailbox Diagnostics logs maintain a history of the holds applied to a user mailbox.

```powershell
$ht = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <username> -ComponentName HoldTracking
$ht.MailboxLog | Convertfrom-Json
```

### Review the results of the Mailbox Diagnostics logs

If you gather data from the previous step, the resulting data may look something like this:

> **ed**`  : 0001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000`
> **hid**` : mbx7cfb30345d454ac0a989ab3041051209:1`
> **ht**`  : 4`
> **lsd**` : 2020-03-23T18:24:37.1884606Z`
> **osd**` : 2020-03-23T18:24:37.1884606Z`

Use the following table to help you understand each of the previous values listed in the diagnostics log.

| Value   | Description |
|:------- |:----------- |
| **ed**  | Indicates the End date, which is the date the retention policy was disabled. MinValue means the policy is still assigned to the mailbox. |
| **hid** | Indicates the GUID for the retention policy. This value will correlate to the GUIDs that you collected for the explicit or organization-wide retention policies assigned to the mailbox.|
| **lsd** | Indicates the Last start date, which is the date the retention policy was assigned to the mailbox.|
| **osd** | Indicates the Original start date, which is the date that Exchange first recorded information about the retention policy. |
|||

When a retention policy is no longer applied to a mailbox, we will place a temporary delay hold on the user to prevent purging content. A delay hold can be disabled by running the `Set-Mailbox -RemoveDelayHoldApplied` command.

## Next steps

After you identify the holds that are applied to a mailbox, you can perform tasks such as changing the duration of the hold, temporarily or permanently removing the hold, or excluding an inactive mailbox from a Microsoft 365 retention policy. For more information about performing tasks related to holds, see one of the following topics:

- Run the [Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity \<Policy Name> -AddExchangeLocationException \<user mailbox>](/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy) command in [Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell) to exclude a mailbox from an organization-wide Microsoft 365 retention policy. This command can only be used for retention policies where the value for the *ExchangeLocation* property equals `All`.
