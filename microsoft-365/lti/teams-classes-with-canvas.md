Microsoft Teams classes is a Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) app that helps educators and students easily navigate between their Learning Management System (LMS) and Teams. Users can access their class teams associated with their course directly from within their LMS.

## Microsoft Office 365 Admin

Before managing the Microsoft Teams integration within Instructure Canvas, it is important to have Canvas’s **Microsoft-Teams-Sync-for-Canvas** Azure app approved by your institution’s Microsoft Office 365 admin in your Microsoft Azure tenant before completing the Canvas admin setup.

2. Select the **Admin** link in the global navigation, and then select your account.

3. In the admin navigation, select the **Settings** link, and then the **Integrations** tab. 

4. Enable Microsoft Teams Sync by turning the toggle on.

7. To approve access for Canvas’s **Microsoft-Teams-Sync-for-Canvas** Azure app, select the **Grant tenant access** link. You'll be redirected to the Microsoft Identity Platform Admin Consent Endpoint.
