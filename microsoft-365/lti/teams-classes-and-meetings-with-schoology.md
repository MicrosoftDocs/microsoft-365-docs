# Integrate Microsoft Teams meetings with Schoology Learning

This guide provides the IT admin steps for registering the Teams Meetings LTI app on PowerSchool Unified Classroom® Schoology Learning.

For an overview of Microsoft LTI, see [Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System (LMS)](index.md).

1. Sign into your Schoology Learning instance as an administrator with access to install and configure apps.
1. Access the **Microsoft Teams Meetings** app in the [**App Center**](https://app.schoology.com/apps) by opening this direct link [Microsoft Teams Meetings on Schoology Learning](https://app.schoology.com/apps/profile/6017478062).
1. Select the **Install LTI 1.3 App** button to begin the installation process.
1. Select the **I agree** button.

    1. Copy the **Deployment ID** assigned to your deployment of the app.
        1. This ID will be used in the **Microsoft LMS Gateway** configuration process.
1. From the [**Organization Apps list**](https://app.schoology.com/apps/school_apps), locate the **Microsoft Teams Meetings** app and select the **Install/Remove** button.
    1. To install the app for all users, choose the **All Users** checkbox.
        1. Select only the roles that will have access to Microsoft Teams in your organization, like teachers, students, or system administrators.
    1. To install the app for all courses, choose the **All Courses** checkbox.
        1. Don't check the **Course Admins Only** option to ensure the app is available to all members of the course.
    1. To install the app for all groups, choose the **All Groups** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose not to install the app for all courses, then *Course Admins* must install the app for themselves by either:
>
> 1. Going to the [Organization Apps list](https://app.schoology.com/apps/school_apps), selecting the **Install/Remove** button, and choosing the courses in which to install the app.
