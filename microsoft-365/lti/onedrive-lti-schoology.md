1. Select the **Admin Consent** button and accept the permissions.
    1. If this step isn't completed successfully, the following step will give you an error, and you may not be able to take this step for an hour once you've gotten the error. If the consent fails, ensure you're signed in as a Global Admin and repeat this step.
