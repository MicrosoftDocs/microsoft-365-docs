# Manage Microsoft OneLTI for any LMS

Microsoft OneLTI integrates with several LMSs including Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle.

In this article, IT admins will find instructions on key OneLTI management tasks.

## Troubleshoot issues with OneLTI

If you or your educators are experiencing issues with Microsoft OneLTI, here are some things you can do to troubleshoot.

### Issues while launching an LTI tool from the LMS

Educators might experience issues launching a Microsoft LTI tool in their LMS.

If so, here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

- **Cookies can't be found**
  - Third-party cookies need to be allowed for the **LMS URL** in the browser settings.
  - These cookies are needed to complete the LTI 1.3 handshake per the IMS specifications.

- **Registration details not found**
  - This issue happens when registration of the LTI tool wasn't completed or if the registration was deleted in the OneLTI admin portal.
  - The IT admin will need to complete registration of the LTI tool.

- **Some details from LMS aren't valid**
  - This issue happens when the details sent from the LMS in the tool launch request aren't aligned with the IMS LTI 1.3 specification.
  - The IT admin will need to reach out to [Microsoft's education support team](https://edusupport.microsoft.com/support?product_id=lti_apps&platform_id=web) if the issue persists.

### Issues with signing in to the registration portal

When signing in to the Microsoft LTI registration portal, you may have issues accessing the registration page or receive a sign-in error.

Here are some common sign-in issues and how to resolve them.

- **Authorization error**
  - If you see the error message, "Your account doesn’t have permission to access this page," then either:
    - The account doesn't belong to a registered tenant, or
    - The account doesn't belong to an educator or an admin.

  - For both these cases, you'll see a **Sign out & switch accounts** button.
    - Select this button or select the **Sign out** button under the user profile menu.
    - Sign in with an account that belongs to the tenant, an educator, or an admin.

  - If the tenant isn't registered, then the IT admin must register it before trying to register LTI integrations.

  - If after trying these steps, you still see this error, then sign out and sign in again.
    - You can also clear cookies and local storage for the LTI registration portal and `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`.
    - Try to sign in again.
    - If the issue persists, report the problem by selecting the **Report a problem** link at the top right.

- **Authentication error**
  - If you see the error message, “Authentication failed. Try again," the sign-in session may have expired.
    - Sign out and sign back in again.
    - You can also clear cookies and local storage for the LTI registration portal and `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`.
    - Try to sign in again.
    - If the issue persists, report the problem by selecting the **Report a problem** link at the top right.

- **Other errors**
  - For all other errors, you'll see the error message, “Something went wrong. Try again later.”
    - This could be an internal processing error.
    - Try signing in again after a few hours.
      - Select the **Go to Home page** button. This will navigate back to the landing page.
      - Select the **Go to registration portal** button to go back to the LTI registration portal.
