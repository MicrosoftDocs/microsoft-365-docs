1. Select **Create Deployment**. \
   Your new deployment will display in the list. Leave this tab option and continue with the next steps.

### Create links to the OneDrive LTI app in Brightspace

This step adds the OneDrive LTI app to menus in the Brightspace LMS where users select to insert OneDrive files.

1. In the tab with your Brightspace admin experience, navigate to **Admin Tools** > **Manage Extensibility** > **LTI Advantage** to view the LTI Advantage apps list.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the **View Deployments** link.
1. Select the name of the deployment you created in the previous step.

#### Create a **Deep Linking Quicklink** for the app that will appear in the **Quicklinks** menu

1. From the **View Links** page, select **New Link**.
1. Enter a name for the link, like `Microsoft OneDrive`. \
   This name will be visible to users in their Brightspace experience.
1. Paste the **Redirect URL** into the **URL** field. \
   This is the same **Redirect URL** used in previous steps, listed as the `ToolOIDCLaunchRedirectUri` in Microsoft's OneDrive LTI Registration Portal.
1. Set the **Type** to **Deep Linking Quicklink**.
1. Select **+Add Customer Parameter** and enter `launchType` for the **Name** field and `linkSelection` for the **Value** field.
1. Select the **Save and Close** button.

#### Create a **Deep Linking Insert Stuff** link for the app that will appear in the **Insert Stuff** menu

1. From the **View Links** page, select **New Link**.
1. Enter in a name for the link, like `Microsoft OneDrive`. \
   This name will be visible to users in their Brightspace experience.
1. Paste the **Redirect URL** into the **URL** field. \
   This is the same **Redirect URL** used in previous steps, listed as the `ToolOIDCLaunchRedirectUri` in Microsoft's OneDrive LTI Registration Portal.
1. Set the **Type** to **Deep Linking Insert Stuff**.
1. Select the **Save and Close** button.

## Step 3: Turn on the new OneDrive LTI app on the Quicklinks Activity Bar

The OneDrive LTI app is now available to users, but the older OneDrive app must now be turned off.

1. Sign in to your Brightspace admin portal.
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Config Variable Browser**
1. Locate the variable titled **d2l.3rdParty.OneDrive.EnableOneDrivePicker** and set the value to **off**.

To add the OneDrive LTI app to Brightspace's activity bar for quick access, you'll need to set an org unit **Config Variable** to the link ID of the LTI app.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to repeat these steps for every org ID (or parent org ID) where you want the OneDrive LTI app to appear in the activity bar.

### Collect the Link ID

1. Sign in to Brightspace as an Administrator or Super Administrator.
1. Navigate to **Admin Tools** by selecting the gear icon at the top right.
1. Select **Manage Extensibility** to view the **LTI Advantage Deployments** list.
1. Select the name of the LTI Advantage app you created.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **View Deployments**.
1. Select the name of the app deployment you created.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **View Links**.
1. Select the name of the link with the **Deep Linking Quicklink** type.
1. Move your mouse to the URL address bar in your browser.
1. Copy the numeric digits after the final `/` in the URL. \
   For example, if the link url is `https://example.desire2learn.com/d2l/le/ltiadvantage/deployments/3bfcc0b7-2fb6-4ffe-b353-95b520d4bae6/links/details/259`, copy the `259` numeric value.

### Update the Config Variables

1. In the Brightspace admin portal, navigate to **Admin Tools** by selecting the top right gear icon.
1. Select **Config Variable Browser**.
1. In the **All Variables** menu on the left, navigate to **3rdParty** > **Microsoft** >  and select **OneDriveLTI**. \
   You should see the variable name `3rdparty.microsoft.onedriveLTI.linkId` in the right pane.
1. Select the **LinkId variable** name.
1. On the **LinkId configuration** screen, select **Add Value** to select an **Org Unit** and paste the numeric **Link ID** value you collected previously.  \
   You'll need to repeat this for each Org Unit you wish to use the **Quicklinks Activity Bar**.
1. To have this setting applied to descendent org types of those you added, you can edit the **Cascading Org Unit Types** and select which types and in which order the settings will apply.

The OneDrive LTI app will now show up in the **Add Existing Content**, **QuickLinks**, and **Insert Stuff** menus in Brightspace.

Users will see a generic link icon rather than a OneDrive cloud icon. The name shown in the menu will be the name provided in the app's LTI link settings.  

These links can be turned off and on as desired and targeted to specific Orgs and decedents by configuration.

## Common questions concerning the OneDrive LTI app

### Does the new OneDrive LTI FilePicker support personal accounts?

Yes, personal accounts are allowed to open OneDrive to upload the files. There's a checkbox in the app in the OneDrive LTI Registration Portal to allow multiple accounts or not. If checked, personal accounts are allowed.

### Does the FilePicker support multiple languages?

The OneDrive LTI FilePicker looks at the LTI language setting parameter passed from the LMS, and (as backup) the browser setting (since the former is an optional claim) to determine the language to use.
