# Use Microsoft Teams Meetings LTI with any LTI 1.3 compliant LMS

The Teams Meetings LTI app incorporates Teams meetings into LMS courses. Educators and students can view past and upcoming meetings, schedule individual or recurring meetings, and join team meetings related to the course, all from within their LMS.

Teams Meetings LTI uses the [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability), which allows any LMS that is LTI 1.3 compliant to integrate Teams Meetings for its educators and students.

This guide provides the **IT admin** steps for registering the Teams Meetings LTI app for any LMS that is LTI 1.3 compliant.

For an overview of Microsoft LTI, see [Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System (LMS)](index.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The person who performs this integration should be an administrator of their LMS and a Microsoft 365 administrator.
