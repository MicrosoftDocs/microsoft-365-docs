# Integrate Microsoft Teams classes and meetings within Open LMS

This guide provides the IT admin steps for registering both Teams Classes and Teams Meetings LTI apps on Open LMS.

For details on managing all LTI apps for any LMS, see [Manage Microsoft LMS Gateway for any LMS](manage-microsoft-one-lti.md).

## Prerequisites before set up

For the integration between Open LMS and Teams to function correctly, Open LMS and Teams must be set up to communicate with one another.

Follow the [instructions for installing and configuring the Moodle plugin](open-lms-plugin-configuration.md).

## Register Microsoft Teams LTI for use in Open LMS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person who performs this integration should be an Open LMS administrator and a Microsoft 365 tenant administrator.

1. Visit [Microsoft LMS Gateway](https://lti.microsoft.com/) and select the **Go to registration portal** button.

2. Sign in with a Microsoft 365 administrator account.

3. After signing in, select **Add new registration**.

4. Select either **Teams Meetings LTI** or **Teams Classes LTI** to register and then select **Next**.

5. Enter in an easily identifiable **Registration** name and select **Open LMS** as the LMS platform. Select **Next**.

6. You'll be given a list of keys that need to be added to your Open LMS site.

7. Open Open LMS in another tab. Don't close the Microsoft LMS Gateway tab.

8. In Open LMS, go to **Site administration** > **Plugins** > **Activity modules** > **External tools** > **Manage tools**.

9. On the **Manage tools** page, select **configure a tool manually**.

10. Under **Tool settings**, enter in a **Tool name** like **Microsoft Teams Classes**. For **LTI version**, select **LTI 1.3**. For **Public key type**, select **Keyset URL**.

11. Next, copy the keys from **Microsoft LTI keys** to the corresponding tools inputs.
    1. Microsoft's **Target link URL** key goes into Open LMS's **Tool URL** field.
    1. Microsoft's **Open ID connection URL** key goes into Open LMS's **Initiate login URL** field.
    1. Microsoft's **Redirect URL** key goes into Open LMS's **Redirection URI(s)** field.

12. Select **Save changes**.

13. The new tool should now appear in the **Tools** section of Open LMS's **Manage tools** page. Select the list icon to view **Tool configuration details**.

14. Go back to the Microsoft LMS Gateway tab. Select **Next** to go to the **LMS provided registration keys** step.

15. Copy and paste the values from Open LMS's **Tool configuration details** to Microsoft's **LMS provided registration keys** step.

  Paste the values as follows:

  | On Open LMS | On Microsoft LTI registration portal |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
  | Platform ID | Issuer ID URL |
  | Client ID | Client ID |
  | Deployment ID | Deployment ID |
  | Public keyset URL | Keyset URL |
  | Access token URL | Access token URL |
  | Authentication request URL | Platform authentication URL |

  Select **Next**.

16. Review the **Review and add** page. If there are no errors, select **Save and exit**. You should see a message indicating successful registration.

You've completed registration of either the Teams Classes or Teams Meetings LTI app.

If you would like to add the other app too, repeat the steps above, selecting the other Teams LTI app in step 4.
