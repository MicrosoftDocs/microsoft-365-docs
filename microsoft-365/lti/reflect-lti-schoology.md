# Integrate Microsoft Reflect LTI with Schoology Learning

[Microsoft Reflect](https://reflect.microsoft.com) is a wellbeing app designed to foster connection, expression, and learning by promoting self-awareness, empathy, and emotional growth.
    
Reflect LTI integration with Schoology is designed in compliance with the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards, ensuring strong security and straightforward installation within your Schoology environment.

Integrate Reflect into Schoology to create impactful check-ins, gain wellbeing insights, and build a happier, healthier learning community.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide provides IT admins steps for registering the Reflect LTI app for PowerSchool Unified Classroom® Schoology Learning.
> 
> The person who performs this integration should be an administrator of Schoology Learning.

## One-time setup by administrator

1. Sign into your Schoology Learning instance as an administrator with access to install and configure apps.
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Reflect in the App Center](https://app.schoology.com/apps/profile/7024494126).
1. Select the **Install LTI 1.3 App** button to begin the installation process.
1. Select the **I agree** button.
1. You're asked if the app should be installed for your entire organization or just for you. Select **Add to Organization**, and you're redirected to the **Organization Apps** page to complete the configuration.
1. From the [**Organization Apps list**](https://app.schoology.com/apps/school_apps), locate the **Microsoft Reflect** app, and select the **Install/Remove** button.
1. Choose the **All Courses** checkbox. ***Don't*** check the "Course Admins Only" option to ensure the app is available to all members of the course.
1. Select **Submit** to complete the installation.

Reflect is now installed and ready to use in any course in your Schoology instance.

> [!NOTE]

> 1. Or, they can select the **Install Your App(s)** link at the bottom of the course left rail navigation menu, and then select the **Microsoft Reflect** app to install.

## Ongoing use by course owners and members

1. After the initial setup, course owners and members will find a tab of Reflect in every course.
1. On their first access, they need to sign in using their Microsoft account to get started.
1. Course owners can [create and share check-ins](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/c6cbbacc-5655-450e-bca9-988ddc506017).
