# Allow cookies for LMS URLs in your browser

Third-party browser cookies are needed to complete the LTI 1.3 handshake according to IMS Global standards. Therefore, when launching the LTI tool from a Learning Management System (LMS), the browser setting must allow third-party cookies for the LMS URL.

Here are the steps to allow the cookies in your browser.

# [Microsoft Edge](#tab/edge)

## Allow cookies for LMS URLS in Microsoft Edge

1. In the Edge **Settings** window, select **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and data stored** > **Manage and delete cookies and site data**.
2. Turn on **Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)**, and make sure that **Block third-party cookies** is turned off.

If you must keep third-party cookies blocked:

1. In the Edge **Settings** window, select **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and data stored** > **Manage and delete cookies and site data**.
2. Under **Allow**, select **Add** to add the domain URL of the LMS platform.
   1. For example, if the LMS platform is hosted at `https://contoso.com`, then that URL must be added under **Allow**.
