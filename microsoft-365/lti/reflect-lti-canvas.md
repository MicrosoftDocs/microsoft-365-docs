# Integrate Microsoft Reflect LTI with Canvas

[Microsoft Reflect](https://reflect.microsoft.com) is a wellbeing app designed to foster connection, expression, and learning by promoting self-awareness, empathy, and emotional growth.
    
Reflect LTI integration with Canvas is designed in compliance with the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards, ensuring strong security and straightforward installation within your Canvas environment.

Integrate Reflect into Canvas to create impactful check-ins, gain wellbeing insights, and build a happier, healthier learning community.
