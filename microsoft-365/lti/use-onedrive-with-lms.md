Learn the benefits of using Microsoft OneDrive with your Learning Management System (LMS).

**Brings Microsoft Office 365 directly into your workflows**

The Microsoft OneDrive Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) App integrates with your LMS to bring Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft Office 365 directly into your most important workflows that include:

- Attaching resources and organizing content.
- Starting collaborative documents.
- Creating and grading assignments.

**Secure and fully compliant with latest LTI standards**

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI App is compatible with LTI 1.3 and LTI Advantage. This advantage allows for a highly secure and tightly integrated user experience.

**Modern and Rich User Experience**

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI App brings the best of Microsoft right into your LMS experience. We're improving upon the existing Office 365 integration in your LMS by delivering a more modern user experience, complete with a new and expanded Microsoft OneDrive file picker and richer editing experiences for Office files. Microsoft will also fully own the Microsoft OneDrive LTI App going forward, which means youâ€™ll always get the latest and greatest from Microsoft automatically.

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI App allows you to:

- Attach Office 365 files including Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel from the Rich Content Editor.

- Distribute Office 365 cloud assignments.

- View and organize your personal and course Microsoft OneDrive files.

- Create collaborations where course members can work together on shared documents in real time.

- Access multiple Microsoft OneDrive accounts, including personal and school accounts.

- Integrate Office 365 files with your course modules.

- Use your Microsoft account for single sign-on with your LMS.
