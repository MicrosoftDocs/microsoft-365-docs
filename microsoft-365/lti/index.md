Microsoft Education and our third-party partners understand that the flow of teaching and learning invariably crosses solution boundaries. We're working on providing more seamless experiences, keeping educators and learners focused on their goals, rather than having to juggle tools. We're integrating Microsoft products wherever teaching and learning occurs, including within and alongside Learning Management Systems (LMS). We've worked with our LMS partners to create a suite of tools using the [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) that brings the best of Microsoft directly into your LMS.

These tools include a new OneDrive LTI app, a new Teams Meetings LTI app, and a new Class Teams LTI app. These new tools are highly secure and fully compatible with LTI 1.3 and LTI Advantage standards. The OneDrive LTI app allows educators and students to bring OneDrive cloud storage and Office 365 files directly into assignment and content creation workflows within an LMS. The Teams Meetings LTI app allows educators and students to manage, schedule, and access their Teams Meetings from within a meetings hub in their LMS. The Class Teams LTI app allows educators to create a team for their course within their LMS using the LMS course roster with daily roster updates. Students can then access the team right from within the LMS. We are excited to bring these new tools to customers and continue to improve our solutions according to your feedback.
