description: Learn about Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) Microsoft apps, and how they will help educators when integrating Microsoft apps into their Learning Management System (LMS).

# Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System (LMS)

Microsoft Education and our third-party partners understand that the flow of teaching and learning invariably crosses solution boundaries. We're working on providing more seamless experiences, keeping educators and learners focused on their goals, rather than having to juggle tools. We're integrating Microsoft products wherever teaching and learning occurs, including within and alongside Learning Management Systems (LMS).

We've worked with our LMS partners to create a suite of tools using the [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) that brings the best of Microsoft directly into your LMS.

These tools include:

- [OneDrive LTI](#onedrive-lti-apps)
- [Teams Assignments LTI](#teams-assignments-lti)
- [Teams Meetings LTI](#teams-meetings-lti)
- [Teams Classes LTI](#teams-classes-lti)
- [Microsoft Reflect LTI](#microsoft-reflect-lti)

For general information on managing Microsoft LTI apps, see [Manage Microsoft LTI apps for any LMS](manage-microsoft-one-lti.md).
