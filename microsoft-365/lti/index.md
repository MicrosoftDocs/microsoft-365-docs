# Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System (LMS)

Microsoft Education and our third-party partners understand that the flow of teaching and learning invariably crosses solution boundaries. We're working on providing more seamless experiences, keeping educators and learners focused on their goals, rather than having to juggle tools. We're integrating Microsoft products wherever teaching and learning occurs, including within and alongside Learning Management Systems (LMS).

We've worked with our LMS partners to create a suite of tools using the [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) that brings the best of Microsoft directly into your LMS.

These tools include:

- [OneDrive LTI](#onedrive-lti-apps)
- [Teams Meetings LTI](#teams-meetings-lti)
- [Teams Classes LTI](#teams-classes-lti)
- [Microsoft Reflect LTI](#microsoft-reflect-lti)

For general information on managing Microsoft LTI apps, see [Manage Microsoft LTI apps for any LMS](manage-microsoft-one-lti.md).

## OneDrive LTI apps

Learn more about using Microsoft OneDrive with your Learning Management System (LMS).

- **Brings Microsoft 365 directly into your workflows**

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI app integrates with your LMS to bring Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft 365 directly into your most important workflows that include:

- Attaching resources and organizing content.
- Starting collaborative documents.
- Creating and grading assignments.

- **Secure and fully compliant with latest LTI standards**

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI App is compatible with LTI 1.3 and LTI Advantage, allowing for a secure and integrated user experience.

- **Modern and rich user experience**

We're improving upon the existing Microsoft 365 integration in your LMS by delivering a modern user experience, complete with an expanded Microsoft OneDrive file picker and rich editing experiences for Office files.

Microsoft owns the OneDrive LTI app, which means youâ€™ll always get the latest updates from Microsoft automatically.

The Microsoft OneDrive LTI App allows you to:

- Attach Microsoft 365 files including Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel from the Rich Content Editor.
- Distribute Microsoft 365 cloud assignments.
- View and organize your personal and course Microsoft OneDrive files.
- Create collaborations where course members can work together on shared documents in real time.
- Access multiple Microsoft OneDrive accounts, including personal and school accounts.
