2. Select  **Install Office**  >  **Microsoft 365 apps**  >  **Run** , and then select  **Yes**.
3. The Microsoft 365 apps are installed. The process might take several minutes. When it completes, select  **Close**.
4. To install Microsoft Teams, go to the [office.com page](https://office.com), and then choose  **Teams**.
5. Get the Windows app, and then select  **Run**. Teams displays a prompt when installation is complete.
