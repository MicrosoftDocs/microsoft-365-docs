# Review remediation actions in the Microsoft Defender portal

Okay, you've discovered a security breach, but what do you do? It depends on the nature of it.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes remediation actions. Some actions are taken automatically when threats are detected, and other actions can be taken manually by your security team.

Examples of remediation actions include sending a file to quarantine, stopping a process from running, or completely removing a scheduled task. All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center, which is located at [https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center).
