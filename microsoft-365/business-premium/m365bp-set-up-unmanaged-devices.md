# Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices

:::image type="content" source="media/mission3.png" alt-text="Diagram with Set Up Unmanaged Devices highlighted.":::

Every device, whether [managed or unmanaged](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md), is a possible attack avenue into your network. Fortunately, there are steps that everyone can take to protect their devices. In this critical mission, train everyone to protect unmanaged devices (also referred to as bring-your-own devices, or BYODs). It's important to help everyone get their devices protected as soon as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies primarily to unmanaged (or BYOD) devices. Guidance for protecting managed devices is available here: [Set up and secure managed devices](m365bp-protect-managed-devices.md).
> 
> [Learn more about managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md).

Your objectives are to:

- [Get everyone to set up MFA](m365bp-mfa-for-users.md).
- [Get Microsoft 365 Apps installed on devices](m365bp-users-install-m365-apps.md).
- [Protected unmanaged Windows and Mac devices](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).

Once you've achieved these objectives, proceed to [Use email securely](m365bp-use-email-securely.md).
