    questions:
      - question: What is Microsoft 365 Business Premium?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 is an integrated solution that brings together best-in-class productivity tools, security, and device management capabilities for small to medium-sized businesses. It's a comprehensive, cloud-based security solution that enables you to defend your business against advanced cyberthreats with sophisticated phishing and ransomware protection. Microsoft 365 Business Premium helps you safeguard your data, devices and information. 
          
          Microsoft 365 Business Premium is fully integrated with Microsoft 365 Apps to provide you with a familiar location for administration, billing, and 24x7 support. It consists of enterprise-grade technology built for businesses with fewer than 300 employees.
          
      - question: How can I get Microsoft 365 Business Premium for my business?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Business Premium can be purchased through a [Microsoft Partner](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/search) or directly from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com//microsoft-365/business). In choosing whether to purchase directly from Microsoft or via a Microsoft Partner, you should consider your on-staff capability and desire to maintain an IT infrastructure. A Microsoft Partner can help you deploy and manage your IT infrastructure, including Microsoft solutions.
          
      - question: How much does Microsoft 365 Business Premium cost?
        answer: Microsoft 365 Business Premium is offered at $22 (USD) per user/month based on an _annual contract_ if purchased directly from Microsoft. When purchased through a Microsoft Partner, pricing can vary based on the services the partner provides and their pricing model for Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

      - question: Is there a cap to how many Microsoft 365 Business Premium seats a customer can have?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Business Premium was designed for small to medium-sized businesses with low to medium IT complexity requirements. Customers can purchase up to 300 Microsoft 365 Business Premium licenses for their organization. Customers can mix and match cloud subscriptions. As a result, depending on their IT requirements, customers might add another subscription, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Business, or another Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription to the same account.
          
          If you are considering using multiple subscription types, consider working with a trusted IT advisor to determine how best to manage and secure the various subscriptions. Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Microsoft 365 Enterprise use different capabilities to secure and manage applications and data.
          
      - question: Can I combine Microsoft 365 Business Premium with other Microsoft subscription offerings?
        answer: |
          Yes, customers can combine their Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscriptions with plans and add-ons from Azure, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Office 365.

      - question: Is everyone in my business required to have a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription?
        answer: |
          No, not everyone needs a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, although the security and management benefits are available only to those users with devices managed with a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription.
          
          Standardizing an IT environment helps reduce maintenance and security costs over time and is a state that businesses should strive to attain. However, we recognize that some small and medium-sized customers update their software primarily when they upgrade their hardware, over an extended period. Businesses can deploy  Premium to part of their organization, but for best protection of sensitive business data and consistent collaboration experiences, deployment to all users is recommended.
          
      - question: How can I know if the hardware and software I run today is compatible with Microsoft 365 Business Premium?
        answer: |
          See [Microsoft 365 Business Premium requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-premium?activetab=pivot:techspecstab). 
          
          Also see the recommended application testing process for [Windows 10 compatibility](/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-compatibility#recommended-application-testing-process) and review the [Office system requirements](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements#subscription-plans-section) to ensure a smooth transition to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.
          
      - question: What is Windows for business?

These operating systems include cloud services and device management capabilities that enable the centralized management and security controls of Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

      - question: How does Microsoft 365 Business Premium help support our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy?
        answer: |
          Many employees prefer to use their own mobile phones or tablets to access personal and work information rather than carrying multiple devices for each purpose. The use of personal devices for work, while commonplace, increases the risk that business information could end up in the wrong hands. Many competing mobile data protection solutions require users to switch to a specific mode on their device or use another complex mechanism that users may find intrusive and therefore avoid using.
          
          Microsoft 365 Business Premium offers customers a simple but powerful means of enabling employees to use their personal devices for work while providing the business with the ability to prevent those devices from accessing, retaining, and/or sharing business information.

      - question: How does Microsoft 365 Business Premium help protect PCs in my organization from malicious attacks?
        answer: |
          PCs managed with Microsoft 365 Business Premium are protected by Microsoft Defender for Business, an endpoint security solution that was designed especially for the small- and medium-sized business (up to 300 employees). With this endpoint security solution, your company's devices are better protected from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats. 
          
      - question: What's the difference between Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, and Microsoft 365 Enterprise?

Customers that have questions about how Microsoft can help them meet their additional GDPR obligations should learn about the advanced compliance and security capabilities available in Microsoft 365 Business Premium (for example, Azure Information Protection, data loss prevention, Defender for Office 365, and so on) and in other suites (for example, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5).
