- [Work with a Microsoft partner](m365bp-setup.md#work-with-a-microsoft-partner) who can help you get everything set up and configured.

## Guided setup process

Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes a guided process. The following video shows the guided setup process for Microsoft 365 Business Standard, which also applies to Microsoft 365 Business Premium. (Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes [advanced security settings that you'll configure](m365bp-security-overview.md) after your basic setup process is complete.)<br/><br/>

**As soon as you've completed the guided setup process, proceed to [boost your security protection](m365bp-security-overview.md)**.

> [!TIP]
> After you have added users, give them a link to the [Employee quick setup guide](https://support.microsoft.com/office/7f34c318-e772-46a5-8c0a-ab86661542d1). The guide walks them through signing in, getting Microsoft 365 apps, and saving, copying, and sharing files.

### The guided setup process, step by step

1. As a global administrator, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in. By default, you'll see the simplified view, as shown in the following image:

2. In the upper right corner, select **Dashboard view** so that your admin center resembles the following image. Then select **Go to guided setup**.

3. To install your Microsoft 365 apps (Office), select the download button, and then follow the prompts. Alternately, you can skip this step for now and install your apps later. Then select **Continue**.

4. To add your organization's domain (*recommended*) or to use your default `.onmicrosoft.com` domain, select an option and then follow the prompts. Then select **Use this domain**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To get help with this task, see [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](../admin/setup/add-domain.md).

5. To add a user, fill in the user's first name, last name, and user name, and then select **Add users and assign licenses**. Alternately, you can select **View all users** to go to your active users page, where you can view, add, and manage users. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/m365bp-addusers.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add Users and Assign Licenses page."lightbox="media/m365bp-addusers.png":::

   > [!TIP]
   > We recommend adding your administrators and members of your security team now. To get help with this task, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../admin/add-users/add-users.md).

6. If you added your domain in step 4, you can now connect your domain to Microsoft 365. To get help with this task, see [Change nameservers to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](../admin/get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

When you're finished with the basic setup process, you'll see **Setup is complete**, where you can tell us how setup went and then go to your Microsoft 365 admin center. At this point, basic setup is complete, but you still need to [set up and configure your security settings](m365bp-security-overview.md).
