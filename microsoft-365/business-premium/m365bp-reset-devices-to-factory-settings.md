# Reset Windows devices to factory settings

This article applies to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Business is rolling out to Microsoft 365 Business Premium customers, beginning March 1, 2022. This offering provides additional security features for devices. [Learn more about Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md).

A factory reset reverts a device to the original settings it had when the device was purchased. All apps and data on the device that were installed after purchase are removed. You can use Microsoft 365 for business to factory reset Windows 10 devices you manage.
  
1. Go to the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
    
2. In the left nav, choose **Devices** \> **Manage**.

3. On the **Manage** page, check the checkbox next to the device you want to remove data from and then, in the **Manage** drop-down choose **Factory reset**.
    
4. On the **Are you sure you want to factory reset the devices below** pane, choose **Confirm** \> **Close**.
