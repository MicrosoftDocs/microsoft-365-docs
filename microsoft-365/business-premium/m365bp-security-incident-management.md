# Security incident management

As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play. Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, actions are taken automatically or only upon approval. 

To do this, use the following steps:

1. [Review security recommendations](../security/defender-business/mdb-view-tvm-dashboard.md?toc=/microsoft-365/business-premium/toc.json&bc=/microsoft-365/business-premium/breadcrumb/toc.json).
1. [Review remediation actions](m365bp-review-remediation-actions-devices.md).
1. [Respond to a compromised email account](../security/office-365-security/responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.md)
