# Upgrade Windows devices to Windows 10 or 11 Pro

If you have Windows devices running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro, your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription entitles you to upgrade those devices to Windows 10 or 11 Pro.

You can choose from several methods to upgrade:

- [Use Windows Update](#use-windows-update) (recommended for most users)
- [Upgrade your device using the Microsoft Software Download site](#upgrade-your-device-using-the-microsoft-software-download-site)
- [Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site](#create-installation-media-from-the-microsoft-software-download-site)
- [Purchase Windows 10 or 11 Pro to upgrade from Windows 10 Home](#purchase-windows-10-or-11-pro-to-upgrade-from-windows-10-or-11-home)

## Use Windows Update

*This option is recommended for most users, as it uses a digital license.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that users are assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license before they follow this procedure.

1. On a Windows device, sign in using your account for Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

2. Go to Windows Update, and check for updates.

3. If your device isn't running Windows 10 Pro, you'll be prompted to upgrade. Follow the prompts to complete your upgrade.

## Upgrade your device using the Microsoft Software Download site

2. On the **Download Windows 10** site, select **Update now** to start upgrading the device to Windows 10 Pro.

## Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site

*Select this option to create Windows 10 installation media (USB flash drive or ISO file) that you'll use to install Windows 10 on a different device than the one you're using right now.*

1. Go to the [Microsoft Software Download site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836960).

2. Follow the instructions on how to use the tool and create your installation media.
