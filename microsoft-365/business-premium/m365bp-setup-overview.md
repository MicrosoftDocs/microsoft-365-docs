# Welcome to Microsoft 365 Business Premium

For this first mission, set up your initial security defenses right away. Sign in and initiate the [setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure overall security and licenses for your teams. 

Your objectives are to:

- Sign up and sign in to Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Set up your Microsoft 365 Business Premium environment

Once you've achieved these the objectives, you can move on to the [next mission](m365bp-security-overview.md).

(In my opinion, this is only rehashing the same stuff covered in the TOC topics and references as "mission objectives" above. So, it's not needed here.)

## Admins: Set up Microsoft 365 accounts

The following diagram describes how admins set up Microsoft 365.

![Steps to set up Microsoft 365.](../media/M365-democracy-SetUpProcess.png)

After you've [signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../admin/admin-overview/sign-up-for-office-365.md), complete setup by [running the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

Next, bump up security protection by: [protecting admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md), [protecting access to mail and data](m365bp-conditional-access.md), and [increasing threat protection](m365bp-increase-protection.md).

## Set up devices

Take a few minutes to set up devices to work with your environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.

:::image type="content" source="../media/m365-democracy-user-device-setup.png" alt-text="User device setup process.":::
  
To set up user devices:

1. Each user [sets up their mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json).
2. For unmanaged devices, users set up their [PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).
For key staff, we recommend that you use [managed devices](../business/set-up-windows-devices.md) for even better protection. For all devices, you'll want to set up [multifactor authentication](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
3. All users should learn how to protect themselves and your campaign by learning about [phishing and other attacks](avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your campaign from online threats.
