# What's new in Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Microsoft Defender for Business

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md)

This article lists new features in the latest release of [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md). Features that are currently in preview are denoted with **(preview)**.

## March 2023

- **Mobile threat defense (preview) is added to Defender for Business**. The ability to [onboard iOS and Android devices](../security/defender-business/mdb-onboard-devices.md) to the standalone version of Defender for Business is now in preview! These capabilities provide OS-level threat and vulnerability management, web protection, and app security to help you and employees stay more secure on the go. See [Mobile threat defense capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-mtd.md).

- **Monthly security summary report (preview) is added to Defender for Business** (preview). The new monthly security summary report shows how secure your organization is across identity, devices, information, and apps. You can view threats detected (and blocked) by Defender for Business together with your current status from Microsoft Secure Score. Recommendations to improve your security are also provided. See [Reports in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-reports.md).

- **Device exposure score is now visible in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse** (preview). Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) who are using [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](../lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview.md) can now view and manage device exposure scores across customer tenants. These capabilities enable partners to discover which customers' devices are at risk because of vulnerabilities. See [Overview of the Vulnerability management page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-vulnerability-management-page-overview).

## January 2023

- **Attack surface reduction capabilities are rolling out**. [Attack surface reduction capabilities in Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-asr.md) include attack surface reduction rules and a new attack surface reduction rules report. Attack surface reduction rules target certain behaviors that are considered risky because they're commonly abused by attackers through malware. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com/](https://security.microsoft.com/)), you can now view a report showing detections and configuration information for attack surface reduction rules. In the navigation pane, choose **Reports**, and under **Endpoints**, choose **Attack surface reduction rules**. 

- **Default experience for Defender for Business when an enterprise plan is added**. Defender for Business now retains its default experience ([simplified configuration and setup](../security/defender-business/mdb-simplified-configuration.md)) even if an enterprise plan, such as [Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](../security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint.md) or [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers) is added.
