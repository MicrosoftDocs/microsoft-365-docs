# What's new in Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Microsoft Defender for Business

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md)

This article lists new features in the latest release of [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md). Features that are currently in preview are denoted with **(preview)**.

## January 2023

- **Attack surface reduction rules report is now available**. [Attack surface reduction rules](../security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction.md) target certain behaviors that are considered risky because they are commonly abused by attackers through malware. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com/](https://security.microsoft.com/)), you can now view a report showing detections and configuration information for attack surface reduction rules. In the navigation pane, choose **Reports**, and under **Endpoints**, choose **Attack surface reduction rules**. 

- **Default experience for Defender for Business when an enterprise plan is added**. Defender for Business now retains its default experience ([simplified configuration and setup](../security/defender-business/mdb-simplified-configuration.md)) even if an enterprise plan, such as [Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](../security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint.md) or [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers) is added.
