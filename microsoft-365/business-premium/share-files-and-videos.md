# Share files and videos in a safe environment

It's important to pay attention to who can view and edit files, and where those files are stored. Files should be stored in a secure location with the proper permissions applied. With Microsoft 365 Business Premium, users can use Microsoft Teams to store and share files. Alternately, you can send a SharePoint link. Sending a link rather than an email attachment helps ensure that you know who is viewing or modifying files. Files can't be viewed or modified without permissions granted, whereas email attachments are easily forwarded.

With files in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, files can also be worked on and reviewed together, even tracking changes as needed. In Teams, files are shared inside of a firm, practice, or campaign. If you need to share them externally with people outside your organization, you can add them as guests to a team or send them a secure SharePoint link.

## Best practices

Ensure your users use these methods to share files and videos securely:

1. Store files in Microsoft Teams or SharePoint, and make sure that only the people who need access to those files have them.

2. When you want to share, don't attach files to an email. Instead, choose **Get link** from Microsoft Teams or SharePoint and send the link in email.

3. To share a file externally, add the user as a guest to your team, or use SharePoint to get a secure link to share just that file.

4. Use Microsoft Stream to host videos you want your campaign to see.

5. Use Microsoft Teams or SharePoint to store video files you need your team to collaborate on or share.

## Set up
