# Collaborate and share securely

:::image type="content" source="media/mission5.png" alt-text="Collaborate and share securely using Microsoft Teams SharePoint and OneDrive.":::

Now that you're protected by the Microsoft 365 Business Premium Microsoft 365 apps, your next mission is to set up secure file sharing and communication. The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it. Your organization depends on protecting your data and information, which means that you want to protect your files by all means possible.

Your objectives are to:

- [Create Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md).
- [Set up meetings](set-up-meetings.md).
- [Share files and videos](share-files-and-videos.md).
- [Create a communication site](create-communications-site.md).

Once you've achieved these objectives, proceed to [Set up and secure managed devices](m365bp-protect-devices.md).
