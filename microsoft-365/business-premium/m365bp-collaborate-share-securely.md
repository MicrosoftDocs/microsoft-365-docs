# Collaborate and share securely

Now that you're protected by the Microsoft 365 Business Premium Office apps, your next mission is to set up protections for file sharing and communication. The best way to do this is with Microsoft Teams so that all your files and communications are in a protected environment and not being stored in unsafe ways outside of it. Your organization depends on protecting your data and information, which means that you want to protect your files by all means possible.

Your objectives are as follows:

- [Create Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md)
- [Set up meetings](set-up-meetings.md)
- [Share files and videos](share-files-and-videos.md)
- [Create a communication site](create-communications-site.md)

After you complete these objectives, start your [final mission](m365bp-protect-devices.md).
