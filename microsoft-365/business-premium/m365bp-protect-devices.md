# Set up and secure managed devices

:::image type="content" source="media/mission6.png" alt-text="Secure managed devices with Defender for Business.":::

**Welcome to your final critical mission**! Here, you'll onboard and implement protection for all the managed devices in your organization. Microsoft Defender for Business capabilities now included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium can help ensure that your organization's devices are protected from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats. When you're done completing your objectives, you can rest assured, knowing you've done your part to protect your organization!

Your objectives are to:

- [Upgrade Windows devices running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 or 11 Pro](m365bp-upgrade-windows-10-pro.md).
- [Onboard devices to Defender for Business and apply security policies](m365bp-onboard-devices-mdb.md).
- [Use Windows Autopilot to set up and configure new devices, or to reset, repurpose, and recover devices](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot).
- [Install Microsoft 365 Apps](../admin/setup/install-applications.md) on any devices that don't already have Office applications

Once these objectives have been achieved, your overall mission to protect your organization against cyberattacks and other cybersecurity threats is a success! Now, make sure to set up your response teams to deal with any situation that may arise while defending the integrity of the system. See your next steps!
