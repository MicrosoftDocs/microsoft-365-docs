# Sign in to Microsoft 365 Business for Campaigns

If you signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium), you're designated as the Microsoft 365 admin (also referred to as the Global Administrator). This allows you to sign in and initiate the system. 

Here's how to sign in:

1. Find the username and password we sent to the email address you used when you [signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md).

2. In the browser, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.

3. Type your username and password, and then select **Sign in**.

4. In the top right of the page, find the **Preview on** control. Select **Preview on** so you can use all the controls described in [Bump up protection for your campaign](m365bp-security-overview.md).

## For staff

Users who have been added to your Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium) subscription can sign in by following these steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://office.com" target="_blank">https://office.com</a>.

2. Sign in using the username and password for the account. Users will have this information in the email they receive when they are added as users. If they can't find the email, see [user didn't receive invite email](../admin/simplified-signup/admin-invite-business-standard.md#i-shared-an-email-invite-but-the-user-didnt-receive-the-email).

> [!TIP]
> Provide your staff a link to the [Employee quick setup guide](../admin/setup/employee-quick-setup.md) for help signing in, getting Office apps, and saving, copying, and sharing files.
