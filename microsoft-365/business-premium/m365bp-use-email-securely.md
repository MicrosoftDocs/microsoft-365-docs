# Use email securely

:::image type="content" source="media/mission4.png" alt-text="Diagram with Use email securely highlighted.":::

As you probably already know, email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on people making consistently good decisions with those communications. In this mission, learn how everyone in your organization can help to keep your information safe from attackers.

Your objectives are to:

- [Protect against phishing and other attacks](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md).
- [Set up encrypted email](m365bp-use-labels-encryption.md).

Once you've achieved these objectives, proceed to [Collaborate and share securely](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md).
