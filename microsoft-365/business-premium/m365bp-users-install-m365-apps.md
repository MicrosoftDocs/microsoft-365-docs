# Install Microsoft 365 Apps on your devices

It's a good idea to install the Microsoft 365 Apps on your computers, tablets, and phones. You'll get the latest updates, including security updates, for your apps and you'll have the most current features. 

If you're part of your organization's security team, you can ask users to install the Microsoft 365 Apps on their Mac, PC, or mobile devices. This is something your users should do to be part of the front lines and help protect the org against attack.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies primarily to unmanaged (or BYOD) devices. Microsoft 365 admins can manage Microsoft 365 installation options instead. To learn more, see the following articles:

For all members of the organization, the Microsoft Microsoft 365 Apps can be found on the **Start** menu. If you don't see them, each user must install them.

Have them perform the following:

1. Go to [https://office.com](https://office.com), and sign in using your work account.
2. Select  **Install Office**  >  **Microsoft 365 Apps**  >  **Run** , and then select  **Yes**.
3. The Microsoft 365 Apps are installed. The process might take several minutes. When it completes, select  **Close**.
4. To install Microsoft Teams, go to the [office.com page](https://office.com), and then choose  **Teams**.
5. Get the Windows app, and then select  **Run**. Teams displays a prompt when installation is complete.
