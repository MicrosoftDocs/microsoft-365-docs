# Set up meetings with Microsoft Teams

Make sure members of the organization use Microsoft Teams for all meetings. Teams meetings files include audio, video, and sharing, and because they're online, there is always a meeting space and there's no need for a room with a projector! Microsoft Teams meetings are a great way to come together with your staff both inside and outside of your organization.

Using Teams, you don't need to be a member of the organization or even have an account to join a meeting. You can schedule and run online meetings where you can share your screen, share files, assign tasks, and more. Political campaigns can include staff, volunteers, or guests that are outside your organization. You can easily meet with clients, staff or partners over Microsoft Teams, and in a secure and worry-free environment.
