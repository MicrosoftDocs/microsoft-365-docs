# Maintain your environment

As the users on your network change over time, a secure environment must be maintained. The missions you've completed so far have been about getting the system secured. But in addition to this, you also need to be able to safely and cleanly remove users from the system, thereby removing their access to all data and information. And, there are certain security management tasks to perform. 

Use the following articles to maintain your environment:

- [Review the Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-incident-quick-start.md).
- [Learn how to remove users](m365bp-review-remediation-actions-devices.md).
- [Learn how to add new users](m365bp-add-users.md).
- [Learn how to reset passwords as needed](m365bp-reset-passwords.md).
- [Learn how to remove company data from devices (when necessary)](../admin/devices/remove-company-data.md).
