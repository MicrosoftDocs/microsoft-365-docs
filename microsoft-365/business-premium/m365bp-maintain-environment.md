# Maintain your environment

In addition to security incident management, your company needs a maintenance and operations plan. The missions you completed during the setup and configuration process were about getting your systems secured. But in addition to this, you also need to be able to perform certain tasks, such as adding or removing users, resetting passwords, and resetting devices to factory settings as needed.

See the following articles for more details: 

- [Review the Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-incident-quick-start.md).
- [Add new users](m365bp-add-users.md).
- [Reset passwords (as needed)](m365bp-reset-passwords.md).
- [Remove user accounts](m365bp-review-remediation-actions-devices.md).
- [Remove company data from devices (when necessary)](../admin/devices/remove-company-data.md).
- [Reset devices to factory settings (when needed)](../admin/devices/reset-devices-to-factory-settings.md).
