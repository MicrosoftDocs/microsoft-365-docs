# Maintain your environment

The [missions](index.md) that were completed during the setup and configuration process focused on setting up your subscription, user accounts, and devices, as well as securing users, devices, and data. Now, you can put together plans for administration and security operations.

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| Microsoft 365 administration<br/>(*tenant administration*) | Microsoft 365 administration includes tasks that your administrators (also referred to as *admins*) perform in the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) (and potentially other admin centers, such as the Exchange admin center). <br/><br/>As new employees come in and other employees leave, it's important to manage user accounts and devices. Your admins can add or remove users, reset passwords, reset devices to factory settings, and more. These kinds of tasks (and more!) are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium tenant administration guide](m365bp-admin-guide.md). |
| Security administration | Security administration includes tasks that your security administrators (also referred to as *security admins*) perform in portals, such as: <br/>- The Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) <br/>- The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com))<br/>- The Microsoft Intune admin center ([https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com))<br/><br/>These kinds of tasks include defining or editing security policies, onboarding or offboarding devices, and so forth, and are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security admin guide](m365bp-security-admin-guide.md). |
| Security operations | Security operations (also referred to as *SecOps*) and includes tasks that your security team performs in the Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). <br/><br/>As threats are detected, those threats must be reviewed and addressed. Regular antivirus scans should occur on devices, and you can initiate scans when needed. In addition, you can run automated investigations on devices that have a high risk level or detected threats. These kinds of security tasks (and more!) are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-operations-guide.md). |
