Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md) to help protect your organization's devices from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats. 

> [!NOTE]

Your tasks are to:

1. Upgrade eligible devices to the latest version of Windows. See [Upgrade Windows devices running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 or 11 Pro](m365bp-upgrade-windows-pro.md).

2. Protect devices with Defender for Business. See [Onboard devices to Defender for Business and apply security policies](m365bp-onboard-devices-mdb.md).

3. If you have Windows computers to set up or reset, see [Use Windows Autopilot to set up and configure new devices, or to reset, repurpose, and recover devices](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot).
