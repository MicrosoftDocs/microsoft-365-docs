**Welcome to this critical mission**! Here, you'll onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business and implement protection for all the managed devices in your organization. Defender for Business capabilities, now included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium, can help ensure that your organization's devices are protected from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats. When you're done completing your objectives, you can rest assured, knowing you've done your part to protect your organization!

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies primarily to managed devices. Guidance for protecting unmanaged devices is available here: [Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices](m365bp-set-up-unmanaged-devices.md).
