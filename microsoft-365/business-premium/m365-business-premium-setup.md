5. To add a user, fill in the user's first name, last name, and user name, and then select **Add users and assign licenses**. Alternately, you can select **View all users** to go to your active users page, where you can view, add, and manage users.

   > [!TIP]
   > We recommend adding your administrators and members of your security team now. To get help with this task, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../admin/add-users/add-users.md).

6. If you added your domain in step 4, you can now connect your domain to Microsoft 365. To get help with this task, see [Change nameservers to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](../admin/get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

When you're finished with the basic setup process, you'll see **Setup is complete**, where you can tell us how setup went and then go to your Microsoft 365 admin center.
