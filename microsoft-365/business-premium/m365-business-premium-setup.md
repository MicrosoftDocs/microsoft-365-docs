### The guided setup process, step by step

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in.

2. A Business Advisor screen opens where you can select your top goals for Microsoft 365. Select and save your goals, or select **Skip for new**.

3. By default, you're in the simplified view. In the upper left corner, select **Simplified view > Dashboard view**, and then select **Go to guided setup**.

4. To install your Microsoft 365 Apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook), select the download button, and then follow the prompts. Or, skip this step for now and install your apps later. Select **Continue**.

5. To add your organization's domain (*recommended*) or to use your default `.onmicrosoft.com` domain, select an option and then follow the prompts. Then select **Use this domain**. To get help with this task, see [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](../admin/setup/add-domain.md).

6. To add a user, fill in the user's first name, last name, and user name, and then select **Add users and assign licenses**. Or, select **View all users** to go to your active users page, where you can view, add, and manage users. To get help with this task, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../admin/add-users/add-users.md). We recommend adding your administrators and members of your security team now.

6. If you added your domain in step 5, connect your domain to Microsoft 365. To get help with this task, see [Change nameservers to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](../admin/get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

7. When you see **Setup is complete**, it means you have completed the basic setup process for your subscription. Use the feedback window to tell us how it went, and then visit your [Microsoft 365 admin center](../admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although your basic setup is complete, but you still need to set up and configure your security settings. **Proceed to [set up your security protection](m365bp-security-overview.md)**.
