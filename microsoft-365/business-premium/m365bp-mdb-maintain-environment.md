# Monitor and maintain Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Defender for Business

After you have set up and configured [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](m365bp-overview.md) or the standalone version of [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md), your next step is to prepare a plan for maintenance and operations. It's important to keep your systems, devices, user accounts, and security policies up to date to help protect against cyberattacks. You can use this article as a guide to prepare your plan.

As you prepare your plan, you can organize the various tasks into two main categories, as listed in the following table:

|Task type|Sections|
|---|---|
|**[Security tasks](#security-tasks)**|[Daily security tasks](#daily-security-tasks) <br/>[Weekly security tasks](#weekly-security-tasks)<br/>[Monthly security tasks](#monthly-security-tasks)<br/>[Security tasks to perform as needed](#security-tasks-to-perform-as-needed)|
|**[General admin tasks](#general-admin-tasks)**|[Admin center tasks](#admin-center-tasks)<br/>[Users, groups, and passwords](#users-groups-and-passwords)<br/>[Email and calendars](#email-and-calendars)<br/>[Devices](#devices)<br/>[Subscriptions and billing](#subscriptions-and-billing)|

## Security tasks

Security tasks are typically performed by security administrators and security operators.

### Daily security tasks

### [**Microsoft 365 Business Premium**](#tab/M365BP)

|Task|Description|
|---|---|
|Check your threat vulnerability management dashboard|Get a snapshot of threat vulnerability by looking at your vulnerability management dashboard, which reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. A high exposure score means your devices are more vulnerable to exploitation. <br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), in the navigation pane, select **Vulnerability management > Dashboard**.<br/><br/>2. Take a look at your **Organization exposure score**. If it's in the acceptable or "High" range, you can move on. If it isn't, select **Improve score** to see more details and security recommendations to improve this score. <br/><br/>Being aware of your exposure score helps you to:<br/>- Quickly understand and identify high-level takeaways about the state of security in your organization<br/>- Detect and respond to areas that require investigation or action to improve the current state<br/>- Communicate with peers and management about the impact of security efforts|
|Review pending actions in the Action center|As threats are detected, [remediation actions](#remediation-actions-for-devices) come into play. Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval, which is why these should be monitored regularly. Remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), in the navigation pane, choose **Action center**.<br/><br/>2. Select the **Pending** tab to view and approve (or reject) any pending actions. Such actions can arise from antivirus or antimalware protection, automated investigations, manual response activities, or live response sessions.<br/><br/>3. Select the **History** tab to view a list of completed actions.|
|Review devices with threat detections|When threats are detected on devices, your security team needs to know so that any needed actions, such as isolating a device, can be taken promptly. <br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), in the navigation pane, choose **Reports > General > Security report**.<br/><br/>2. Scroll down to the **Vulnerable devices** row. If threats were detected on devices, you can see that information in this row.|
|Learn about new incidents or alerts|As threats are detected and alerts are triggered, incidents are created. Your company's security team can view and manage incidents in the Microsoft Defender portal.<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), in the navigation menu, select **Incidents**. Incidents are displayed on the page with associated alerts.<br/><br/>2. Select an alert to open its flyout pane, where you can learn more about the alert.<br/><br/>3. In the flyout, you can see the alert title, view a list of assets (such as endpoints or user accounts) that were affected, take available actions, and use links to view more information and even open the details page for the selected alert.|
|Run a scan or automated investigation|Your security team can initiate a scan or an automated investigation on a device that has a high risk level or detected threats. Depending on the results of the scan or automated investigation, [remediation actions](#remediation-actions-for-devices) can occur automatically or upon approval.<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com), in the navigation pane, choose **Assets** > **Devices**.<br/><br/>2. Select a device to open its flyout panel, and review the information that is displayed.<br/>- Select the ellipsis (...) to open the actions menu.<br/>- Select an action, such as **Run antivirus scan** or **Initiate Automated Investigation**.|

### Security tasks to perform as needed

### [**Microsoft 365 Business Premium**](#tab/M365BP)

|Task|Description|
|---|---|
|**Manage false positives/negatives**|A false positive is an entity, such as a file or a process that was detected and identified as malicious even though the entity isn't actually a threat. A false negative is an entity that wasn't detected as a threat, even though it actually is malicious. False positives/negatives can occur with any threat protection solution, including Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender for Business, which are both included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Fortunately, steps can be taken to address and reduce these kinds of issues. <br/><br/>For false positives/negatives on devices, see [Address false positives/negatives in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-false-positives-negatives.md).<br/><br/>For false positives/negatives in email, see the following articles: <br/>- [How to handle malicious emails that are delivered to recipients (False Negatives), using Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/step-by-step-guides/how-to-handle-false-negatives-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)<br/>- [How to handle Legitimate emails getting blocked (False Positive), using Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/step-by-step-guides/how-to-handle-false-positives-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)|

You can use your Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard to reduce exposure and improve your organization's security posture. <br/><br/>See the following articles:<br/>- [Use your vulnerability management dashboard in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-view-tvm-dashboard.md)<br/>- [Dashboard insights](../security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-dashboard-insights.md)|
|**Adjust security policies**|[Reports](../security/defender-business/mdb-reports.md) are available so that you can view information about detected threats, device status, and more. Sometimes it's necessary to adjust your security policies. For example, you might apply strict protection to some user accounts or devices, and standard protection to others. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- For device protection: [View or edit policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-view-edit-create-policies.md) <br/>- For email protection: [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](../security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md)|
|**Analyze admin submissions**|Sometimes it's necessary to submit entities, such as email messages, URLs, or attachments to Microsoft for further analysis. Reporting items can help reduce the occurrence of false positives/negatives and improve threat detection accuracy. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Use the Submissions page to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, legitimate email getting blocked, and email attachments to Microsoft](../security/office-365-security/submissions-admin.md)<br/>- [Admin review for user reported messages](../security/office-365-security/submissions-admin-review-user-reported-messages.md)|
|**Protect priority user accounts**|Not all user accounts have access to the same company information. Some accounts have access to sensitive information, such as financial data, product development information, partner access to critical build systems, and more. If compromised, accounts that have access to highly confidential information pose a serious threat. We call these types of accounts priority accounts. Priority accounts include (but aren't limited to) CEOs, CISOs, CFOs, infrastructure admin accounts, build system accounts, and more.<br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md) <br/>- [Security recommendations for priority accounts in Microsoft 365](../security/office-365-security/priority-accounts-security-recommendations.md)|
|**Protect high-risk devices**|The overall risk assessment of a device is based on a combination of factors, such as the types and severity of active alerts on the device. As your security team resolves active alerts, approves remediation activities, and suppresses subsequent alerts, the risk level decreases. <br/><br/>See [Manage devices in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-manage-devices.md).|
|**Onboard or offboard devices**|As devices are replaced or retired, new devices are purchased, or your business needs change, you can onboard or offboard devices from Defender for Business. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-onboard-devices.md) <br/>- [Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-offboard-devices.md)|
