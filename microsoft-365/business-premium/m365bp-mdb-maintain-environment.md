# Maintain your environment

After you have set up and configured [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) or [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md) (standalone), your next step is to prepare a plan for maintenance and operations. You can use this article as a guide to prepare your plan. 

- **[Microsoft 365 administration](#tenant-administration)** (also referred to as *tenant administration*) includes tasks that your administrators (also referred to as *admins*) perform, such as adding or removing users, resetting passwords, resetting devices to factory settings, and more. These kinds of tasks (and more!) are listed in [Tenant administration](#tenant-administration). 

- **[Security administration](#security-administration)** includes tasks that your security administrators (also referred to as *security admins*) perform, such as defining or editing security policies, onboarding or offboarding devices, and more. These kinds of tasks are listed in [Security administration](#security-administration). 

- **[Security operations](#security-operations)** (also referred to as *SecOps*) includes tasks that your security team performs, such as reviewing and addressing detected threats, running antivirus scans on devices, starting automated investigations, and more. These kinds of tasks are listed in [Security operations](#security-operations). 

In each section, select the tab that corresponds to your subscription.

## Security administration

## [**Microsoft 365 Business Premium**](#tab/M365BP)

Security administrators (also referred to as *security admins*) perform various tasks, such as:

- Defining or editing security policies
- Onboarding or offboarding devices
- Taking steps to protect high-risk user accounts or devices

The following table lists common tasks that security admins typically perform, with links to more detailed information.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| **Manage false positives/negatives** | A false positive is an entity, such as a file or a process that was detected and identified as malicious even though the entity isn't actually a threat. A false negative is an entity that wasn't detected as a threat, even though it actually is malicious. False positives/negatives can occur with any threat protection solution, including Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender for Business, which are both included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Fortunately, steps can be taken to address and reduce these kinds of issues. <br/><br/>For false positives/negatives on devices, see [Address false positives/negatives in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-false-positives-negatives.md).<br/><br/>For false positives/negatives in email, see the following articles: <br/>- [How to handle malicious emails that are delivered to recipients (False Negatives), using Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/step-by-step-guides/how-to-handle-false-negatives-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)<br/>- [How to handle Legitimate emails getting blocked (False Positive), using Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/step-by-step-guides/how-to-handle-false-positives-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) |
| **Strengthen your security posture** | Defender for Business includes a vulnerability management dashboard that provides you with exposure score and enables you to view information about exposed devices and see relevant security recommendations. You can use your Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard to reduce exposure and improve your organization's security posture. <br/><br/>See the following articles:<br/>- [Use your vulnerability management dashboard in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-view-tvm-dashboard.md)<br/>- [Dashboard insights](../security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-dashboard-insights.md) |
| **Adjust security policies** |  [Reports](../security/defender-business/mdb-reports.md) are available so that you can view information about detected threats, device status, and more. Sometimes it's necessary to adjust your security policies. For example, you might apply strict protection to some user accounts or devices, and standard protection to others. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- For device protection: [View or edit policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-view-edit-create-policies.md) <br/>- For email protection: [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](../security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md) |
| **Analyze admin submissions** | Sometimes it's necessary to submit entities, such as email messages, URLs, or attachments to Microsoft for further analysis. Reporting items can help reduce the occurrence of false positives/negatives and improve threat detection accuracy. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Use the Submissions page to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, legitimate email getting blocked, and email attachments to Microsoft](../security/office-365-security/submissions-admin.md)<br/>- [Admin review for user reported messages](../security/office-365-security/submissions-admin-review-user-reported-messages.md) |
| **Protect priority user accounts** | Not all user accounts have access to the same company information. Some accounts have access to sensitive information, such as financial data, product development information, partner access to critical build systems, and more. If compromised, accounts that have access to highly confidential information pose a serious threat. We call these types of accounts priority accounts. Priority accounts include (but aren't limited to) CEOs, CISOs, CFOs, infrastructure admin accounts, build system accounts, and more.<br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md) <br/>- [Security recommendations for priority accounts in Microsoft 365](../security/office-365-security/priority-accounts-security-recommendations.md) |
| **Protect high-risk devices** | The overall risk assessment of a device is based on a combination of factors, such as the types and severity of active alerts on the device. As your security team resolves active alerts, approves remediation activities, and suppresses subsequent alerts, the risk level decreases. <br/><br/>See [Manage devices in Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-manage-devices.md). |
| **Onboard or offboard devices**  | As devices are replaced or retired, new devices are purchased, or your business needs change, you can onboard or offboard devices from Defender for Business. <br/><br/>See the following articles: <br/>- [Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-onboard-devices.md) <br/>- [Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-offboard-devices.md) |

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the navigation pane, choose **Reports > General > Security report**.<br/><br/>2. Scroll down to the **Vulnerable devices** row. If threats were detected on devices, you'll see that information in this row.|
| Learn about new incidents or alerts | As threats are detected and alerts are triggered, incidents are created. Your company's security team can view and manage incidents in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the navigation menu, select **Incidents**. Incidents are displayed on the page with associated alerts.<br/><br/>2. Select an alert to open its flyout pane, where you can learn more about the alert.<br/><br/>3. In the flyout, you can see the alert title, view a list of assets (such as endpoints or user accounts) that were affected, take available actions, and use links to view more information and even open the details page for the selected alert. |
| Run a scan or automated investigation | Your security team can initiate a scan or an automated investigation on a device that has a high risk level or detected threats. Depending on the results of the scan or automated investigation, [remediation actions](#remediation-actions-in-microsoft-365-business-premium) can occur automatically or upon approval.<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com), in the navigation pane, choose **Assets** > **Devices**.<br/><br/>2. Select a device to open its flyout panel, and review the information that is displayed.<br/>- Select the ellipsis (...) to open the actions menu.<br/>- Select an action, such as **Run antivirus scan** or **Initiate Automated Investigation**. |

### Weekly tasks

| Task | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| Monitor and improve your Microsoft Secure score | Microsoft Secure Score is a measurement of your organization's security posture. Higher numbers indicate that fewer improvement actions are needed. By using Secure Score, you can: <br/>- Report on the current state of your organization's security posture.<br/>- Improve your security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.<br/>- Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).<br/><br/>To check your score, follow these steps:<br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the navigation pane choose **Secure score**. <br/><br/>2. Review and make decisions about the remediations and actions in order to improve your overall Microsoft secure score. |
| Improve your secure score for devices | Improve your security configuration by remediating issues using the security recommendations list. As you do so, your Microsoft Secure Score for Devices improves and your organization becomes more resilient against cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities going forward. It's always worth the time it takes to review and improve your score.<br/><br/>To check your secure score, follow these steps: <br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the navigation pane select **Secure score**.<br/><br/>2. From the **Microsoft Secure Score for Devices** card in the Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard, select one of the categories. A list of recommendations related to that category displays, along with recommendations.<br/><br/>3.Select an item on the list to display details related to the recommendation.<br/><br/>4. Select **Remediation options**.<br/><br/>5. Read the description to understand the context of the issue and what to do next. Choose a due date, add notes, and select **Export all remediation activity data to CSV** so you can attach it to an email for follow-up. A confirmation message tells you the remediation task has been created.<br/><br/>6. Send a follow-up email to your IT Administrator and allow for the time that you've allotted for the remediation to propagate in the system.<br/><br/>7. Return to the Microsoft Secure Score for Devices card on the dashboard. The number of security controls recommendations has decreased as a result of your actions.<br/><br/>8. Select **Security controls** to go back to the Security recommendations page. The item that you addressed isn't listed there anymore, which results in your Microsoft secure score improving. |

### Daily tasks

| Task | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **Check your threat vulnerability management dashboard** | Get a snapshot of threat vulnerability by looking at your vulnerability management dashboard, which reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. A high exposure score means your devices are more vulnerable to exploitation. <br/><br/>1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the navigation pane, select **Vulnerability management > Dashboard**.<br/><br/>2. Take a look at your **Organization exposure score**. If it's in the acceptable or "High" range, you can move on. If it isn't, select **Improve score** to see more details and security recommendations to improve this score. <br/><br/>Being aware of your exposure score helps you to:<br/>- Quickly understand and identify high-level takeaways about the state of security in your organization<br/>- Detect and respond to areas that require investigation or action to improve the current state<br/>- Communicate with peers and management about the impact of security efforts |
| **Review pending actions in the Action center** | As threats are detected, [remediation actions](#remediation-actions-in-defender-for-business) come into play.
