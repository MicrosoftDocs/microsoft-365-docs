# Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices

Every  device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be monitored and managed properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. In this critical mission, you set up protection for all the bring-your-own devices (BYODs), which are those that are most risky to your organization due to being unmanaged. It's important to get these devices protected as soon as possible. 

Your objectives are as follows:

- [Set up MFA](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md)
- [Install Office apps](m365bp-install-office-apps.md)
- [Protected unmanaged PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md)

Once you've accomplished these objectives, proceed with your [next mission](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md).
