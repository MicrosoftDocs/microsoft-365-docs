# Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices

:::image type="content" source="media/mission3.png" alt-text="Diagram with Set Up Unmanaged Devices highlighted.":::

Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be monitored and managed properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. In this critical mission, train everyone to protect their bring-your-own devices (BYODs). Unmanaged devices can pose a risk to your organization. It's important to help everyone get their devices protected as soon as possible.

Your objectives are to:

- [Get everyone to set up MFA](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
- [Get Microsoft 365 apps installed on devices](m365bp-install-office-apps.md).
- [Protected unmanaged Windows and Mac devices](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).

Once you've achieved these objectives, proceed to [Use email securely](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md).
