# Set up Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

## Overview

Welcome to your first mission. The following are enhanced security measures that are particularly useful for campaigns, but you may want to use these with any organization as part of your mission to achieve greater security.

For this first mission, you're going to set up your initial security defenses to protect and defend your organization's systems and networks. Sign in and initiate the [setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure overall security and licenses for your teams. 

Your objectives are to:

- Sign up and sign in to Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Set up your Microsoft 365 Business Premium environment

Once you've achieved these objectives, you can move on to the [next mission](m365bp-security-overview.md).

<!---
(In my opinion, this is only rehashing the same stuff covered in the TOC topics and referenced as "mission objectives" above and in the subsections. So, it's not needed here. Don't know if the paragraph for campaigns special pricing still applies, but it does rub against any narrative.)

## Admins: Set up Microsoft 365

The following diagram describes how admins set up Microsoft 365.

![Steps to set up Microsoft 365.](../media/M365-democracy-SetUpProcess.png)

For campaigns that qualify for special pricing, get started by [requesting an invite from Microsoft](https://m365forcampaigns.microsoft.com/), then [signing up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md). To complete setup, [run the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

Next, bump up security protection by: [protecting admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md), [protecting access to mail and data](m365bp-conditional-access.md), and [increasing threat protection](m365bp-increase-protection.md).

## Set up devices

Take a few minutes to set up devices to work with your environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.

To set up user devices:

1. Each user [sets up their mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json).
2. For unmanaged devices, users set up their [PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).
For key staff, we recommend that you use [managed devices](../business/set-up-windows-devices.md) for even better protection. For all devices, you'll want to set up [multifactor authentication](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
3. All users should learn how to protect themselves and your campaign by learning about [phishing and other attacks](avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your campaign from online threats.
