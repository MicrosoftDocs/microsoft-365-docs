# Create a communications site

A great way to communicate priorities, share strategy documents, and highlight upcoming events is to use a communications site in SharePoint, and that's what this mission is all about. Communications sites are for sharing things broadly across your whole business or campaign &mdash; it's your internal strategy site and tactical room. 

## Best practices

Include the following elements in a Communications site:

1. Add your logo and colors as a header image and theme.

2. Lead with your strategy, message, important documents, a directory, and FAQ in a **Hero web part**.

3. Include a CEO or candidate statement to the team in a **Text web part**.

4. Add events to an **Events web part** so everyone can see what's coming up.

5. Add photos that people can use or share to an **Image gallery web part**.

## Admin settings

If you don't see the **+ Create** site link, self-service site creation might not be available in Microsoft 365. To create a team site, contact the person administering Microsoft 365 in your organization. If you're a Microsoft 365 admin, see [Manage site creation in SharePoint Online](/sharepoint/manage-site-creation) to enable self-service site creation for your organization or [Manage sites in the new SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/manage-sites-in-new-admin-center) to create a site from the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219" target="_blank">SharePoint admin center</a>.
