# Set up multi-factor authentication with your mobile device

Multi-factor authentication provides more security because instead of only using a password, or a code through text, a separate app on your phone is used to verify access. This makes it difficult to hack. When MFA is required, members of the organization can use the Microsoft Authenticator app to securely sign in on their devices. <br/><br/>

## Use the Outlook app on your devices

After an admin has required the front-line users to use MFA then the authenticator app serves as a second form of authentication. We recommend you have them install and use the Outlook app to access their Microsoft 365 email. See [Set up mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md) for how to install Office apps, including Outlook, on a phone.
