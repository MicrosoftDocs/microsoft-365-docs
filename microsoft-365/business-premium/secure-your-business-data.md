This article lists the top 10 ways to secure your data with Microsoft 365 for business, and includes links for more information. Microsoft 365 for business plans include security capabilities, such as antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection. Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes even more capabilities, such as device security, advanced threat protection, and information protection. 

## Top 10 ways to secure your business data

The following table lists the top 10 ways to secure business data and describes capabilities that are included in Microsoft 365 for business plans. It's not intended to be an exhaustive list of all capabilities in each plan. For more details about what each plan includes, see [Microsoft 365 User Subscription Suites for Small and Medium-sized Businesses](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWR6bM).

| What to do | [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) | [Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md)  | [Microsoft 365 Business Basic](../admin/setup/setup-business-basic.md) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **[Use multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md)**.<br/><br/>[Multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data. Using MFA can prevent bad actors from taking over your account if they know your password. <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD), which includes security defaults to simplify the process of enabling MFA.*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Azure AD Premium P1](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses), and that includes Conditional Access for more stringent requirements.* <br/><br/>For more information, see [security defaults and MFA](m365bp-conditional-access.md). |![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Premium P1, with security defaults and Conditional Access* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free, with security defaults* |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free, with security defaults* |
| 2. **[Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md)**.<br/><br/>Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks. Whether you're using Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, or Premium, you'll need to set up and manage the right number of admin and user accounts for your business. <br/><br/>We also recommend adhering to the information security principle of least privilege, which means that users and applications should be granted access only to the data and operations they require to perform their jobs.<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Azure AD.*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Azure AD Premium Plan 1.*<br/><br/>For more information, see [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md). |![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Premium P1* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free* |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free* |
| 3. **[Use preset security policies](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Preset security policies save time by applying recommended spam, malware, and phishing policies to users all at once. <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include preset security policies with recommended settings for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing included in [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP).* <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), preset security policies include advanced anti-phishing, spoof settings, impersonation settings, Safe Links, and Safe Attachments.* <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Preset security policies](../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md)<br/>- [Protect against malware and other cyberthreats](m365bp-increase-protection.md) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP plus Defender for Office 365 Plan 1*  | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP*  | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP* |
| 4. **[Protect all devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)**.<br/><br/>Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be configured properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. Your security team and employees can all take steps to protect devices. All users can use MFA on their devices.<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Premium include Microsoft 365 Apps that can be installed on computers, tablets, and phones.* <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Business for securing and managing devices.*<br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles:<br/>- [Secure managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md) <br/>- [Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)<br/>- [Set up and secure managed devices](m365bp-protect-devices.md) |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*MFA, Microsoft 365 Apps, Intune, and Defender for Business* |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*MFA and Microsoft 365 Apps* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*MFA* |
| 5. **[Train everyone on email best practices](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)**.<br/><br/>Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP).* <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), which provides more advanced protection for email and collaboration, with advanced anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware protection, Safe Attachments, and Safe Links.*<br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Protect yourself against phishing and other attacks](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)<br/>- [Anti-phishing protection in Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-protection-about#additional-anti-phishing-protection-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)<br/>- [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-about) <br/>- [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP, advanced anti-phishing and anti-malware, Safe Links, and Safe Attachments* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP*  |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*EOP* |
| 6. **[Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md)**.<br/><br/>The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it.<br/><br/> *Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Microsoft Teams.*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 (with [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#safe-links-settings-for-microsoft-teams) and [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about)) and [Azure Information Protection Plan 1](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection) (with capabilities to discover, classify, protect, and govern sensitive information).* <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md) <br/>- [Set up meetings with Microsoft Teams](set-up-meetings.md) <br/>- [Share files and videos in a safe environment](share-files-and-videos.md)<br/>- [Defender for Office 365 support for Microsoft Teams](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-support-teams-about)<br/>- [Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Teams](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-teams-default-policy)<br/>- [Use sensitivity labels to protect calendar items, Teams meetings, and chat](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-meetings) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Microsoft Teams, Safe Links, Safe Attachments, sensitivity labels, and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)*  | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Microsoft Teams* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Microsoft Teams* |
| 7. **[Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use. We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business. Grant people only the access they need to do their jobs. <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include OneDrive and SharePoint.*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 (with [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about) and [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about)) and [Azure Information Protection Plan 1](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection) (with capabilities to discover, classify, protect, and govern sensitive information).*<br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive](m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders)<br/>- [Sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*SharePoint and OneDrive, with Safe Links, Safe Attachments, sensitivity labels, and DLP* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*SharePoint and OneDrive* |  ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*SharePoint and OneDrive* |

Start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device. Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to documents that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive.<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include Outlook and Web/mobile versions of the Microsoft 365 Apps (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint).*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Premium also include desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps.* <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 (with Safe Links and Safe Attachments), and Azure Information Protection Plan 1 (with sensitivity labels).* <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Install Microsoft 365 Apps on all devices](m365bp-install-office-apps.md).<br/>- [Train your users on Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/train-your-users-on-office-and-microsoft-365-7cba3c97-7f19-46ed-a1c6-763971a26c27)<br/>- [How Safe Links works in Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#how-safe-links-works-in-office-apps)<br/>- [Sensitivity bar in Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#sensitivity-bar)| ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Outlook and Web, mobile, and desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps, with Safe Links and sensitivity labels* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Outlook and Web/mobile/desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Outlook and Web/mobile versions of Microsoft 365 Apps* | 
| 9. **[Manage calendar sharing for your business](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing)**.<br/><br/>You can help people in your organization share their calendars appropriately for better collaboration. You can manage what level of detail they can share, such as by limiting the details that are shared to free/busy times only.<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Outlook and Exchange Online.* <br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Azure Information Protection Plan 1, and that includes DLP policies to protect sensitive information.*<br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Manage calendar sharing](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing) <br/>- [Get started with the default DLP policy](/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-with-the-default-dlp-policy) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Outlook, Exchange Online, and DLP* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Exchange Online* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Exchange Online* |
| 10. **[Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md)**.<br/><br/>After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan. As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings. You'll also want to make sure people have only the access they need to do their jobs.<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) for managing user accounts.*<br/><br/>*Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) and the [Microsoft 365 Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) for viewing and managing security & compliance capabilities.* <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md) <br/>- [Security incident management in Microsoft 365 Business Premium](m365bp-security-incident-management.md)<br/>- [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-incident-quick-start.md) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Azure AD portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and Microsoft 365 Purview compliance portal* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Azure AD portal and Microsoft 365 admin center*  | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>*Azure AD portal and Microsoft 365 admin center* |

## Top 10 ways to secure your business data

1. [Use multi-factor authentication](#1-use-multi-factor-authentication).
2. [Protect your administrator accounts](#2-protect-your-administrator-accounts).
3. [Use preset security policies](#3-use-preset-security-policies).
4. [Protect all devices](#4-protect-all-devices).
5. [Train everyone on email best practices](#5-train-everyone-on-email-best-practices).
6. [Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing](#6-use-microsoft-teams-for-collaboration-and-sharing).
7. [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](#7-set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders).
8. [Use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices](#8-use-microsoft-365-apps-on-devices).
9. [Manage calendar sharing for your business](#9-manage-calendar-sharing-for-your-business).
10. [Maintain your environment](#10-maintain-your-environment).   

The following sections describe these methods in more detail and include links to additional information.

## 1. Use multi-factor authentication

[Multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data. Using MFA can prevent bad actors from taking over your account if they know your password. 

To help simplify the process of enabling MFA, [security defaults in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) are available in Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium. 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Azure AD Premium P1](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses) for advanced administration. It enables you to set up and configure [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) policies instead of security defaults, for more stringent requirements.

See [Turn on multi-factor authentication](m365bp-turn-on-mfa.md).

| Subscription | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) | [Use either security defaults or Conditional Access](m365bp-turn-on-mfa.md).  |
| [Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md)<br/>[Microsoft 365 Business Basic](../admin/setup/setup-business-basic.md) | [Use security defaults](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults). | 

## 2. Protect your administrator accounts

Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks. Make sure to set up and manage the right number of admin and user accounts for your business. 

We also recommend adhering to the information security principle of least privilege, which means that users and applications should be granted access only to the data and operations they require to perform their jobs. 

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) to set up and manage your admin accounts.

See [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md).

| [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) <br/>[Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md) <br/>[Microsoft 365 Business Basic](../admin/setup/setup-business-basic.md) | [Assign admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles). |

## 3. Use preset security policies

[Preset security policies](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies) save time by applying recommended spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing policies to users all at once. 

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP). It includes preset security policies for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing. 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet). It includes preset security policies for advanced anti-phishing, spoof settings, impersonation settings, Safe Links, and Safe Attachments.

## 4. Protect all devices

Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be configured properly, even devices that are personally owned but used for work. Your security team and all employees can all take steps to protect devices. For example, all users can use MFA on their devices.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium enable users to use MFA on their devices.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes advanced device protection with [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md). Defender for Business includes threat and vulnerability management, attack surface reduction, next-generation protection, endpoint detection and response, and automated investigation capabilities. 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) for managing devices. 

See the following articles:

- [Secure managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md) 
- [Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices](m365bp-set-up-unmanaged-devices.md)

## 5. Train everyone on email best practices

Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. 

Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. 

Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include [EOP](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md), which provides anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection for email hosted in Exchange Online. 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), which provides more advanced protection for email and collaboration, with advanced anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware protection, Safe Attachments, and Safe Links.

## 6. Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing

The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes:

- [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), with [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#safe-links-settings-for-microsoft-teams) and [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about) for Microsoft Teams.

## 7. Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders

Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use. We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business. Grant people only the access they need to do their jobs. 

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include OneDrive and SharePoint.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes:

- [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), with [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about) and [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about) for Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive.

## 8. Use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices

Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps (also referred to as Office apps) enable people to work productively and more securely across devices. Start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device. Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to documents that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Outlook and Web/mobile versions of [Microsoft 365 Apps](/deployoffice/about-microsoft-365-apps) (such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel). 

Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Premium include desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps that can be installed on computers, tablets, and phones. Installing the Microsoft 365 Apps helps ensure users get the latest features, new tools, security updates, and bug fixes. (PC users also get Access and Publisher.)

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes:
- [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet) (with Safe Links and Safe Attachments)

## 9. Manage calendar sharing for your business

You can help people in your organization share their calendars appropriately for better collaboration. You can manage what level of detail they can share, such as by limiting the details that are shared to free/busy times only.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include Outlook and Exchange Online.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Azure Information Protection Plan 1](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection), and that includes DLP policies to protect sensitive information.

## 10. Maintain your environment

After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan. As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings. You'll also want to make sure people have only the access they need to do their jobs.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) for managing user accounts.

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes advanced security and compliance capabilities. You can use the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) or the [Microsoft 365 Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) for viewing and managing security & compliance capabilities.
