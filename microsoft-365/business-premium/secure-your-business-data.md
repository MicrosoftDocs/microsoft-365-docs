This article lists the top 10 ways to secure your data with Microsoft 365 for business, with links for more information. Microsoft 365 for business plans include security capabilities, such as antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection. Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes even more capabilities, such as device security, advanced threat protection, and information protection. 

## Top 10 ways to secure your business data

The following table lists the top 10 ways to secure business data and includes capabilities that are included in Microsoft 365 for business plans. It's not intended to be an exhaustive list of all capabilities in each plan. For more details about what each plan includes, see [Microsoft 365 User Subscription Suites for Small and Medium-sized Businesses](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWR6bM).

| What to do | [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) | [Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md)  | [Microsoft 365 Business Basic](../admin/setup/setup-business-basic.md) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **[Use multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md)**.<br/><br/>[Multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data. Using MFA can prevent bad actors from taking over your account if they know your password. <br/><br/>See [security defaults and MFA](m365bp-conditional-access.md). |*Use security defaults or Conditional Access in [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium P1](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses).* | *Use [security defaults in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults).* |  *Use [security defaults in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults).* |
| 2. **[Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md)**.<br/><br/>Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks. You'll need to set up and manage the right number of admin and user accounts for your business. <br/><br/>We also recommend adhering to the information security principle of least privilege, which means that users and applications should be granted access only to the data and operations they require to perform their jobs.<br/><br/>See [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md). |*Use the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) or the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to manage user accounts.* | *Use the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) or the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to manage user accounts.* |  *Use the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) or the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to manage user accounts.* |
| 3. **[Use preset security policies](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Preset security policies save time by applying recommended spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing policies to users all at once.<br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Preset security policies](../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md)<br/>- [Protect against malware and other cyberthreats](m365bp-increase-protection.md) | *Use preset security policies for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing in [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP). And, use preset security policies for advanced anti-phishing, spoof settings, impersonation settings, Safe Links, and Safe Attachments in [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet).*  | *Use [preset security policies in EOP](../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md).*  | *Use [preset security policies in EOP](../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md).* |
| 4. **[Protect all devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)**.<br/><br/>Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be configured properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. Your security team and employees can all take steps to protect devices. For example, all users can use MFA on their devices.<br/><br/>See:<br/>- [Secure managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md) <br/>- [Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)<br/>- [Set up and secure managed devices](m365bp-protect-devices.md) |  *Use MFA, Microsoft 365 Apps on devices, and advanced device security with [Microsoft Defender for Business](../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md) and [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).* |  *Use MFA and Microsoft 365 Apps on devices.*<br/>(*Defender for Business can be added on*) | *Use MFA.*<br/>(*Defender for Business can be added on*) |
| 5. **[Train everyone on email best practices](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)**.<br/><br/>Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. <br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Protect yourself against phishing and other attacks](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)<br/>- [Anti-phishing protection in Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-protection-about#additional-anti-phishing-protection-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)<br/>- [Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-about) <br/>- [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about) | *Use EOP and advanced protection for email with [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet).* | *Use EOP.* <br/>(*Defender for Office 365 can be added on*) |  *Use EOP.*<br/>(*Defender for Office 365 can be added on*) |
| 6. **[Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md)**.<br/><br/>The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it.<br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md) <br/>- [Set up meetings with Microsoft Teams](set-up-meetings.md) <br/>- [Share files and videos in a safe environment](share-files-and-videos.md)<br/>- [Defender for Office 365 support for Microsoft Teams](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-support-teams-about)<br/>- [Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Teams](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-teams-default-policy)<br/>- [Use sensitivity labels to protect calendar items, Teams meetings, and chat](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-meetings) | *Use Microsoft Teams with [Safe Links & Safe Attachments](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-support-teams-about), [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-meetings), and [DLP](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-teams-default-policy).*  | *Use Microsoft Teams.*<br/>(*Defender for Office 365 can be added on*) | *Use Microsoft Teams.*<br/>(*Defender for Office 365 can be added on*) |
| 7. **[Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use. We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business. Grant people only the access they need to do their jobs. <br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive](m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders)<br/>- [Sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files) | *Use SharePoint and OneDrive, with Safe Links, Safe Attachments, sensitivity labels, and DLP.* | *Use SharePoint and OneDrive.* |  *Use SharePoint and OneDrive.* |
| 8. **[Use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/train-your-users-on-office-and-microsoft-365-7cba3c97-7f19-46ed-a1c6-763971a26c27)**.<br/><br/>Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps (also referred to as Office apps) enable people to work productively and more securely across devices. Start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device. Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to documents that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive.<br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Install Microsoft 365 Apps on all devices](m365bp-install-office-apps.md).<br/>- [Train your users on Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/train-your-users-on-office-and-microsoft-365-7cba3c97-7f19-46ed-a1c6-763971a26c27)<br/>- [How Safe Links works in Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#how-safe-links-works-in-office-apps)<br/>- [Sensitivity bar in Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#sensitivity-bar)| *Use Outlook and Web, mobile, and desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps, with [Safe Links](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#how-safe-links-works-in-office-apps) and [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps).* | *Use Outlook and Web/mobile/desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps.* | *Use Outlook and Web/mobile versions of Microsoft 365 Apps.* | 
| 9. **[Manage calendar sharing for your business](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing)**.<br/><br/>You can help people in your organization share their calendars appropriately for better collaboration. You can manage what level of detail they can share, such as by limiting the details that are shared to free/busy times only.<br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Manage calendar sharing](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing) <br/>- [Get started with the default DLP policy](/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-with-the-default-dlp-policy) | *Use Outlook, Exchange Online, and [DLP](/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-with-the-default-dlp-policy).* | *Use Outlook and Exchange Online.* | *Use Outlook and Exchange Online.* |
| 10. **[Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md)**.<br/><br/>After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan. As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings. You'll also want to make sure people have only the access they need to do their jobs.<br/><br/>See: <br/>- [Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md) <br/>- [Security incident management in Microsoft 365 Business Premium](m365bp-security-incident-management.md)<br/>- [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-incident-quick-start.md) | *Use the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) and the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) for managing user accounts.<br/>Use the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) and the [Microsoft 365 Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) for viewing and managing security & compliance capabilities. <br/>You can also use the [Intune admin center](https://intune.microsoft.com) to view or manage devices.* | *Use the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com). to view or manage user accounts.*  | *Use the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and the [Azure AD portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) to view or manage user accounts.* |
