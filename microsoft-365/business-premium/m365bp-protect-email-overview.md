# Protect all email

As you know, emails are full of malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Additionally, email systems are especially vulnerable because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and it relies upon humans making consistently safe decisions with those communications. In this mission you are ensuring email systems are safe from attackers. 

The mission objectives are to:

- [Protect against phishing and other attacks](avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)
- [Set up encrypted email](send-encrypted-email.md)

Accomplish these objectives before you move on to the [next mission](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md).
