# Use email securely

:::image type="content" source="media/mission4.png" alt-text="Diagram with Use email securely highlighted.":::

As you probably already know, email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Additionally, email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. In this mission, learn how members of the organizations can all help to keep the system safe from attackers.

Your objectives are to:

- [Protect against phishing and other attacks](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md).
- [Set up encrypted email](send-encrypted-email.md).

Once you've achieved these objectives, proceed to [Collaborate and share securely](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md).
