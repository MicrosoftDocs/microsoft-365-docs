# Bump up security

In this mission, you bump up your security defenses. As you must know by now, Admin account access is a high-value target for the enemy hackers, and protecting those accounts is critical because the access and control they provide can impact the entire system. 

To be successful in this mission, you're going to to set up the different Admin roles and specific levels of security for them. You'll also enforce MFA requirements and set up your security defaults. Stay vigilant - the safety and reliability of the system relies upon you.

This mission has the following objectives:

- [Protect Admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md)
- [Turn on security defaults](m365bp-conditional-access.md)
- [Protect against malware and other threats](m365bp-increase-protection.md)

Achieve these objectives and then start your [next mission](m365bp-devices-overview.md).
