# Boost your security protection

:::image type="content" source="media/mission2.png" alt-text="Diagram with Boost Your Security Protection highlighted.":::

In this mission, you boost your security defenses. You begin by enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements through either security defaults or Conditional Access. Next, you'll set up the different admin roles and specific levels of security for them. Admin account access is a high-value target for potential cyberattackers. Protecting those accounts is critical because the access and control they provide can impact your entire system. And, you'll protect your email content and devices.

Stay vigilant - the safety and reliability of your system relies upon you.

Your objectives are to:

1. [Turn on MFA](m365bp-turn-on-mfa.md).
2. [Protect your admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md).
3. [Protect against malware and other threats](m365bp-protect-against-malware-cyberthreats.md).
4. [Secure managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md).
5. [Set up information protection capabilities](m365bp-set-up-compliance.md).
