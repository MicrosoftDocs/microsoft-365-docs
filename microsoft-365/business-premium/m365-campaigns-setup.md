## What does Microsoft 365 for Campaigns include?

Microsoft 365 for Campaigns includes simple controls that help you and your staff work together securely:

- **Protect user identity**: Make sure that users are who they say they are when they sign in to send email or to access files (multifactor authentication).

- **Protect mobile devices**: Protect data on mobile devices (mobile app protection policy).

## What does it cost, who needs it, and what is the commitment?

If your campaign qualifies for special pricing, Microsoft 365 for Campaigns costs $5 per user per month.

To protect your campaign, we recommend a license for the candidate, the campaign manager, all senior staff who are part of the campaign or party, and usually all full-time staff. Certain volunteer employees might also need a license. In general, assign a license to anyone in your campaign who needs protected email and devices.

There's no minimum time commitment when you sign up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns. You can pay monthly for the licenses you need and stop using the service anytime.

2. After you've completed the form, it takes us a few days to review your information.
