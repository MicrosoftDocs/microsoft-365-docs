## Sign in to Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

If you signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium), you're designated as the Microsoft 365 admin (also referred to as the Global Administrator). This allows you to sign in and initiate the system.

Here's how to sign in:

1. Find the username and password we sent to the email address you used when you [signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md).

2. In the browser, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank"><https://admin.microsoft.com></a>.

3. Type your username and password. Select **Sign in**.

4. In the top right of the page, find the **Preview on** control. Select **Preview on** so you can use all the controls described in [Bump up protection for your campaign](m365bp-security-overview.md).

## How your staff will sign in

Users who have been added to your Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium) subscription can sign in using the following steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://office.com" target="_blank"><https://Office.com></a>.

2. Sign in using the username and password for the account. Users will have this information in the email they receive when they are added as users. If they can't find the email, see [user didn't receive invite email](../admin/simplified-signup/admin-invite-business-standard.md#i-shared-an-email-invite-but-the-user-didnt-receive-the-email).

> [!TIP]
> Provide your staff a link to the [Employee quick setup guide](../admin/setup/employee-quick-setup.md) for help signing in, getting Office apps, and saving, copying, and sharing files.

## Customize your sign-in page with a privacy and consent notice

Your business or campaign can make it easier for law enforcement agencies to file legal charges against online criminals by adding a privacy and consent notice to your sign-in page.

You can customize your sign-in page with your branding. You can also add text to help your users sign in, or to point out legal requirements or restrictions for getting access to Microsoft 365 resources.

## Customize the text on your sign-in page

To update the customizable elements on the sign-in page, you have to be a global admin. For specific instructions, see [add company branding](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding) article.

The elements you can update are:

- Sign-in page text (an easy place to add the privacy and consent statement)
- Sign-in page background image
- Banner logo
- Username hint

For examples of privacy and consent notices, see Appendix A in [Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf).
