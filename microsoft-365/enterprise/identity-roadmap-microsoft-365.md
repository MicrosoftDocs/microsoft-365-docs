# Identity roadmap for Microsoft 365

In Microsoft 365 for enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

Watch this video for an overview of identity models and authentication for Microsoft 365 for enterprise.

For the identity features of each Microsoft 365 for enterprise plan, the role of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), on-premises and cloud-based components, and the most common authentication configurations, see the [Identity Infrastructure poster](../downloads/m365e-identity-infra.pdf).

This two-page poster is a quick way to ramp up on identity concepts and configurations for Microsoft 365 for enterprise.

You can also [download this poster](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/downloads/m365e-identity-infra.pdf) and print it in letter, legal, or tabloid (11 x 17) formats.

## Plan

To plan for your identity implementation:

- [Understand the different identity models](about-microsoft-365-identity.md)
- [Plan for hybrid identity and directory synchronization](plan-for-directory-synchronization.md)

## Deploy

To deploy your identity implementation:

- [Protect your global administrator accounts](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md)
- [Configure and use cloud-only identities](cloud-only-identities.md)
- [Configure and use hybrid identities](prepare-for-directory-synchronization.md)
- [Set up directory synchronization](set-up-directory-synchronization.md)
- If needed, deploy [hybrid identity scenarios](hybrid-solutions.md)

### Identity and device access recommendations

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. For identity, use the recommendations and settings in these articles:

- [Prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md)

## Manage

To manage your identity implementation:

- [Assign licenses and manage user accounts](assign-licenses-to-user-accounts.md)
- [Monitor directory synchronization](view-directory-synchronization-status.md)
