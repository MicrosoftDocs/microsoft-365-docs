# Identity roadmap for Microsoft 365

In Microsoft 365 for enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security, including restricting access to your productivity workloads and their data to only authenticated users and devices.

For an overview of identity models and authentication for Microsoft 365 for enterprise, watch this video.

For information about the identity features of each Microsoft 365 for enterprise plan, the role of Azure Active Directory, both the on-premises and cloud-based components, and the most common authentication configurations, see the [Identity Infrastructure poster](../downloads/m365e-identity-infra.pdf).

Review this two-page poster to quickly ramp up on identity concepts and configurations for Microsoft 365 for enterprise.

You can also [download this poster](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/downloads/m365e-identity-infra.pdf) and can print it in letter, legal, or tabloid (11 x 17) format.

## Plan

To plan for your identity implementation:

- [Understand the different identity models](about-microsoft-365-identity.md)
- [Plan for hybrid identity and directory synchronization](plan-for-directory-synchronization.md)

## Deploy

To deploy your identity implementation:

- [Protect your global administrator accounts](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md)
- [Configure and use cloud-only identities](cloud-only-identities.md)
- [Configure and use hybrid identities](prepare-for-directory-synchronization.md)
- [Set up directory synchronization](set-up-directory-synchronization.md)
- If needed, deploy [hybrid identity scenarios](hybrid-solutions.md)

### Identity and device access recommendations

To help ensure a secure and productive workforce, Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](../security/office-365-security/microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md). For identity, use the recommendations and settings in these articles:

- [Prerequisites](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md)

## Manage

To manage your Microsoft 365 identity deployment, see:

- [User accounts](manage-microsoft-365-accounts.md)
- [Licenses](assign-licenses-to-user-accounts.md)
- [Passwords](manage-microsoft-365-passwords.md)
- [Groups](manage-microsoft-365-groups.md)
- [Governance](manage-microsoft-365-identity-governance.md)
- [Directory synchronization](view-directory-synchronization-status.md)
