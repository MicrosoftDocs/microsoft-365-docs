# Architectural models for SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for Business, and Lync

These IT posters describe the architectural models and deployment options for SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for Business, and Lync, and they provide design information for deploying SharePoint in Microsoft Azure.
  
With Microsoft 365, you can provide the collaboration and communication services your users are familiar with as a cloud-based service. With a few exceptions, the user experience remains the same whether you are maintaining an on-premises deployment or using Microsoft 365. This unified user experience makes it less straightforward to decide where to place each workload and raises questions such as:
  
- How do you determine which platform option to choose for your individual workloads?
    
- Does it make sense to keep any service on-premises?
    
- What is a scenario where a hybrid deployment is appropriate?
    
- How does Microsoft Azure fit in the picture?
    
- What are the supported configurations for Office Server workloads in Azure?
