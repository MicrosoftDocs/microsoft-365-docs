# Microsoft 365 mailbox migrations

With an Exchange-based hybrid deployment, customers can choose to either move on-premises Exchange mailboxes to an [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/exchange-online) organization or move Exchange Online mailboxes to an [Exchange on-premises](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/exchange-server) organization. Migration batches are used when moving mailboxes between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.

Customers can review statistics and other information about mailbox migrations with the following cmdlets:

- [Get-MoveRequestStatistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/move-and-migration/Get-MoveRequestStatistics?view=exchange-ps): Provides default statistics for a user mailbox, which includes the status, mailbox size, archive mailbox size, and percentage complete.
- [Get-Mailbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/Get-Mailbox?view=exchange-ps
): Provides a summary list of mailbox objects and attributes in the organization.
- [Get-Recipient](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/Get-Recipient?view=exchange-ps): Provides a list of existing mail-enabled objects such as mailboxes, mail users, contacts, and distribution groups.
- [Get-MoveRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/move-and-migration/Get-MoveRequest?view=exchange-ps): Provides a detailed status of an ongoing mailbox migration.
- [Get-MigrationUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/move-and-migration/Get-MigrationUser?view=exchange-ps): Provides information about the mailbox move and migration users.
- [Get-MigrationBatch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/move-and-migration/Get-MigrationBatch?view=exchange-ps): Provides information on the status of current migration batch.
- [Get-MigrationUserStatistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/move-and-migration/Get-MigrationUserStatistics?view=exchange-ps): Provides detailed information about the migration status for a specific user.
- [Get-MailboxStatistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/Get-MailboxStatistics?view=exchange-ps): Provides information about mailboxes, such as size, the number of messages, and the last accessed time.
