## Applies to everyone

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Prepare to notify users about restarting and signing in to and out of their clients after migration. | Office client licensing will transition from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 services in the migration. Clients pick up a new valid license after signing out of and in to Office clients. |	Users' Office products need to refresh licenses from Office 365 services. If licenses aren't refreshed, Office products may experience license validation errors. |
| Ensure network connectivity to [Office 365 services URLs and IP addresses](./urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md). | All clients and services hosted by the customer that are used to access Office 365 service must be able to access the Office 365 Global services endpoints. <br>In case, you or your collaboration partners have firewall rules in place that would prevent accessing the URLs and IP addresses listed in [Office 365 services URLs and IP addresses](./urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md) must change the firewall rules to permit access to the Office 365 Global service endpoints| Failures of the service or client software can occur if this is not done before Phase 4  |
| Cancel any trial subscriptions. | Trial subscriptions will not be migrated and will block transfer of paid subscriptions. | Trial services are expired and non-functioning if accessed by users after cancellation. |
| Analyze differences in license features between Microsoft Cloud Deutschland and Office 365 Services. | Office 365 services include additional features and services not available in the current Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. During subscription transfer, new features will be available to users. | <ul><li> Analyze the different features provided by the licenses for Microsoft Cloud Deutschland and Office 365 Services. Start with the [Office 365 platform Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-platform-service-description). </li><li> Determine if any new features of Office 365 services should be initially disabled to limit effects on users or on user change management, and alter user license assignments as needed. </li><li>Prepare users and help desk staff for new services and features provided by Office 365 services. |
| Create organization-wide [retention policies](../compliance/retention.md) to protect from inadvertent deletion of content during migration.  |<ul><li>To ensure that content isn't inadvertently deleted by end users during the migration, customers may choose to enable an organization-wide retention policy. </li><li>Although retention isn't required, since holds placed at anytime during the migration should work as expected, having a retention policy is a back-up safety mechanism. At the same time, a retention policy might not be used by all customers, especially those who are concerned about over preservation.</li></ul>| Apply retention policy as described in [Learn about retention policies and retention labels](../compliance/retention.md). Failures of the service or client software can occur if this is not done before Phase 4 of 9. </li></ul>|
| Correct license overages | In certain circumstances customers may be able to consume more services than are purchased. This condition is known as a license overage. Microsoft cannot migrate customers in a license overage condition from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to the German datacenter regions. To ensure continuous access to the service and data, every assigned user requires a license. | All customers | Customers must evaluate and resolve the license overage condition through purchase of additional licenses or by unassigning licenses from users. |

## Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

**Applies to**: Customers using AD FS on premises to authenticate users connecting to Microsoft Office 365

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| [Backup of Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) farm](ms-cloud-germany-transition-add-adfs.md#backup) for disaster recovery scenarios. | Customers need to back up the AD FS farm appropriately to ensure the relying party trusts to global & Germany endpoints can be restored without touching the issuer URI of the domains. Microsoft recommends using AD FS Rapid Restore for a backup of the farm and the respective restore, if necessary. | Required Action. Inaction will result in service impact during the migration if the AD FS farm of the customer fails. For more information, refer to [ADFS Migration steps](./ms-cloud-germany-transition-add-adfs.md) |

## SharePoint Online

**Applies to**: Customers using SharePoint 2013 on premises


| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Limit SharePoint 2013 workflows, use during the SharePoint Online migration. | Reduce SharePoint 2013 workflows and complete in-flight workflows before transitions. | Inaction may result in user confusion and help desk calls. |
||||

## Skype for Business Online

**Applies to**:  Skype For Business Online customers

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Deploy Teams desktop client for users who access Skype for Business in Germany. | Migration moves Skype for Business users to Microsoft Teams for collaboration, calling, and chat. Either, deploy the Microsoft Teams desktop client or ensure that a supported browser is available. | Inaction will result in unavailability of Microsoft Teams collaboration services. |
| Review and prepare for migration-related DNS changes. | Customer-owned DNS zone changes for Skype for Business Online. |<ul><li>We recommend that you update the Time-to-Live (TTL) for any  customer-owned domain DNS records to 5 minutes to expedite the refreshing of DNS records. However, the Microsoft-managed cutover associated with this DNS change may occur anytime within the provided 24-hour change window. </li><li>Disruption of service is possible in the future. Users won't be able to log into Skype for Business and will be redirected to the migrated Teams experience in the Office 365 services. </li></ul>|
| Prepare End User and Administration training and readiness for the transition to Microsoft Teams. | Be successful in your transition from Skype to Teams by planning user communication and readiness. | <ul><li>Clients need to be aware of the new services and how to use once their services are transitioned to the Office 365 services. </li><li>After DNS changes are made for both the customer vanity domains and the initial domain, users would sign into Skype for Business and see that they now are migrated to Teams. This would also download the desktop client for Teams in the background. </li></ul>|
||||

## Mobile

If you're using a third-party mobile device management (MDM) solution:

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| Prepare end-user and administration training about users removing and re-adding their account to Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android. | Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android accounts configured with mailboxes in Microsoft Cloud Deutschland may have to be removed and added again to Outlook in order to properly synchronize the new Office 365 services configuration. | Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android customers | Outlook mailboxes previously configured for Microsoft Cloud Deutschland may not pick up the new Office 365 Services configuration, leading to errors and degraded performance of other user experiences. IT admins are encouraged to provide documentation that proactively instructs users to remove and re-add their accounts to Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android if issues with signing in or synchronizing mail occur after migration. |
| Determine if any reconfiguration is required after migration. | Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions may target `outlook.de` endpoints. In this transition to Office 365 Services, client profiles should update to the Office 365 services URL, `outlook.office365.com`. | Exchange Online and MDM customers | Clients may continue to function while the `outlook.de` endpoint is accessible, but they'll fail if Microsoft Cloud Deutschland endpoints are no longer available. |
|||||

## Line-of-business apps

If you're using a third-party service or line-of-business (LOB) apps that are integrated with Office 365: 

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Determine if any reconfiguration is required after migration. | Third-party services and applications that integrate with Office 365 may be coded to expect Microsoft Cloud Deutschland IP addresses and URLs. | Required action. Inaction may result in failures of the service or client software. |
||||

## Dynamics	365

**Applies to**: Customers using Microsoft Dynamics

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| For Dynamics 365 sandbox subscriptions, be sure to download the production environment of the Dynamics SQL instance from your Dynamics 365 subscription in Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. The latest production backup should be restored to the sandbox before sandbox migration. | Migration of Dynamics 365 requires customers to ensure that the Sandbox environment is refreshed with the latest production database. | The FastTrack team will assist customers in performing dry runs to validate the version upgrade from 8.x to 9.1.x. |
||||

## Power BI

**Applies to**: Power BI customers 

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Removal of objects from Power BI subscriptions that won't be migrated from Power BI Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 services. | Migration of Power BI services will require customer action to delete certain artifacts, such as datasets and dashboards. | <ul><li>Admins may have to remove the following items from their subscription: </li><li>Real-Time datasets (for example, streaming or push datasets) </li><li>Power BI on-premises Data Gateway configuration and data source </li></ul>|
||||

## DNS

**Applies to**: Customers using Office Desktop client (Microsoft 365 Apps, Office 365 ProPlus, Office 2019, 2016, ...)<br>
Remove MSOID, CName from customer-owned DNS if it exists anytime before Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) cut-over. A TTL of 5 minutes can be set so that the change can take effect quickly.

## Federated identity

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Add an identifier for single sign-on (SSO) to an existing relying party trust and disable AD FS metadata auto-updates. | An ID must be added to the AD FS relying party trust before starting your migration. To avoid accidental removal of the relying party identifier, disable auto-update for metadata updates. <br><br> Run this command as a single command line on the AD FS server: <br>`Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust -TargetIdentifier urn:federation:microsoftonline.de -Identifier @('urn:federation:microsoftonline.de', 'https://login.microsoftonline.de/extSTS.srf', 'https://login.microsoftonline.de') -AutoUpdate $False`
| Federated authentication organizations | Required Action. Inaction before Phase 4 of 9 (SharePoint) will result in service impact during the migration.  |
| Generate relying party trust for global Azure AD endpoints. | Customers need to manually create a relying party trust (RPT) to [global](https://nexus.microsoftonline-p.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml) endpoints. This is done by adding a new RPT via GUI by leveraging the global federation metadata URL and then using [Azure AD RPT Claim Rules](https://adfshelp.microsoft.com/AadTrustClaims/ClaimsGenerator#:~:text=%20Azure%20AD%20RPT%20Claim%20Rules%20%201,Azure%20AD.%20This%20will%20be%20what...%20More%20) (in AD FS Help) to generate the claim rules and import them into the RPT. | Federated authentication organizations | Required Action. Inaction will result in service impact during the migration. |

**Step:** Determine which Azure services are in use and prepare for future migration from Germany to the Office 365 services tenant by working with your partners. Follow the steps described in the [Azure migration playbook](/azure/germany/germany-migration-main).

**Description:** Migration of Azure resources is a customer responsibility and requires manual effort following prescribed steps. Understanding what services are in use in the organization is key to successful migration of Azure services. 

Office 365 Germany customers who have Azure subscriptions under the same identity partition (organization) must follow the Microsoft-prescribed order when they can begin subscription and services migration.

**Applies to:** Azure Customers

**Impact:** 

- Customers may have multiple Azure subscriptions, each subscription containing infrastructure, services, and platform components. 
- Administrators should identify subscriptions and stakeholders to ensure prompt migration and validation is possible as part of this migration event.

  Failing to successfully complete migration of these subscriptions and Azure components within the prescribed timeline will affect completion of the Office and Azure AD transition to Office 365 services and may result in data loss.
- A Message center notification will signal the point at which customer-led migration can begin.
