# Microsoft 365 Teams monitoring

Microsoft Teams monitoring supports the following organizational scenarios with near real-time information:

![Organization-level scenarios for Teams Monitoring.](../media/microsoft-365-exchange-monitoring/TeamsMonitoring1.png)

- **App Launch**. The number of times users opened the Teams client without errors. Data is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.

- **Chat**. The number of chat messages sent and delivered in Teams. Data is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.

- **Join Meeting**. The number of times users joined Teams meetings without errors. Data is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.

Admins can use the information to correlate any Microsoft-reported issues with the usage data to confirm any actual impact to their organization. Also, admins can view any usage from the last two weeks of usage data to identify any  anomalies.
