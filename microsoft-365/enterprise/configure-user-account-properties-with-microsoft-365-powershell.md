# Configure Microsoft 365 user account properties with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

You can use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> to configure properties for the user accounts of your Microsoft 365 tenant. In PowerShell, you can also do this, plus some other things you can't do in the admin center.
  
## Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

To configure properties for user accounts in the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module, use the [**Set-AzureADUser**](/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureaduser) cmdlet and specify the properties to set or change.

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module).

### Change properties for a specific user account

You identify the account with the *-ObjectID* parameter and set or change specific properties by using additional parameters. Here's a list of the most common parameters:
  
- -Department "\<department name>"

- -DisplayName "\<full user name>"

- -FacsimilieTelephoneNumber "\<fax number>"

- -GivenName "\<user first name>"

- -Surname "\<user last name>"

- -Mobile "\<mobile phone number>"

- -JobTitle "\<job title>"

- -PreferredLanguage "\<language>"

- -StreetAddress "\<street address>"

- -City "\<city name>"

- -State "\<state name>"

- -PostalCode "\<postal code>"

- -Country "\<country name>"

- -TelephoneNumber "\<office phone number>"

- -UsageLocation "\<2-character country or region code>"

    This is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (A2) two-letter country or region code.

For additional parameters, see [Set-AzureADUser](/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureaduser).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can assign licenses to a user account, you must assign a usage location.

To display the User Principal Name for your user accounts, run the following command.
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
1. Get all the information on the user accounts (**Get-AzureADUser**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Sort the list of User Principal Names alphabetically (**Sort UserPrincipalName**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Display just the User Principal Name property for each account (**Select UserPrincipalName**).

1. Display them one screen at a time (**More**).

To display the User Principal Name for an account based on its display name (first and last name), run the following commands. Fill in the *$userName* variable, and remove the \< and > characters:
  
```powershell
$userName="<Display name>"
Write-Host (Get-AzureADUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
```

This example displays the User Principal Name for the user account that has the display name *Caleb Sills*.
  
```powershell
$userName="Caleb Sills"
Write-Host (Get-AzureADUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
```

By using a *$upn* variable, you can make changes to individual accounts based on their display name. Here's an example that sets *Belinda Newman*'s usage location to France. But it specifies her display name rather than her User Principal Name:
  
```powershell
$userName="Belinda Newman"
$upn=(Get-AzureADUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
Set-AzureADUser -ObjectID $upn -UsageLocation FR
```

### Change properties for all user accounts

To change properties for all users, you can use a combination of the **Get-AzureADUser** and **Set-AzureADUser** cmdlets. The following example changes the usage location for all users to *France*:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -All $true | Set-AzureADUser -UsageLocation FR
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
1. Get all of the information on the user accounts (**Get-AzureADUser**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Set the user location to France (**Set-AzureADUser -UsageLocation FR**).

### Change properties for a specific set of user accounts

To change properties for a specific set of user accounts, you can use a combination of the **Get-AzureADUser**, **Where**, and **Set-AzureADUser** cmdlets. The following example changes the usage location for all the users in the Accounting department to *France*:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.Department -eq "Accounting"} | Set-AzureADUser -UsageLocation FR
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
1. Get all the information on the user accounts (**Get-AzureADUser**), and send it to the next command (**|**).

1.  Find all the user accounts that have their *Department* property set to "Accounting" (**Where {$_.Department -eq "Accounting"}**), and send the resulting information to the next command (**|**).

1. Set the user location to France (**Set-AzureADUser -UsageLocation FR**).

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

To configure properties for user accounts with the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell, use the **Set-MsolUser** cmdlet and specify the properties to set or change.

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).
  
> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell Core doesn't support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with *Msol* in their name. Run these cmdlets from Windows PowerShell.

### Change properties for a specific user account

To configure properties for a specific user account, use the [**Set-MsolUser**](/previous-versions/azure/dn194136(v=azure.100)) cmdlet and specify the properties to set or change. 

You identify the account with the *-UserPrincipalName* parameter and set or change specific properties by using additional parameters. Here's a list of the most common parameters.
  
- -City "\<city name>"

- -Country "\<country name>"

- -Department "\<department name>"

- -DisplayName "\<full user name>"

- -Fax "\<fax number>"

- -FirstName "\<user first name>"

- -LastName "\<user last name>"

- -MobilePhone "\<mobile phone number>"

- -Office "\<office location>"

- -PhoneNumber "\<office phone number>"

- -PostalCode "\<postal code>"

- -PreferredLanguage "\<language>"

- -State "\<state name>"

- -StreetAddress "\<street address>"

- -Title "\<title name>"

- -UsageLocation "\<2-character country or region code>"

    This is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (A2) two-letter country or region code.

For additional parameters, see [Set-MsolUser](/previous-versions/azure/dn194136(v=azure.100)).

To see the User Principal Names of all your users, run the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-MSolUser | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
1. Get all of information for the user accounts (**Get-MsolUser**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Sort the list of User Principal Names alphabetically (**Sort UserPrincipalName**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Display just the User Principal Name property for each account (**Select UserPrincipalName**).

1. Display them one screen at a time (**More**).

To display the User Principal Name for an account based on its display name (first and last name), run the following commands. Fill in the *$userName* variable, and remove the \< and > characters.
  
```powershell
$userName="<Display name>"
Write-Host (Get-MsolUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
```

This example displays the User Principal Name for the user named Caleb Sills:
  
```powershell
$userName="Caleb Sills"
Write-Host (Get-MsolUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
```

By using a *$upn* variable, you can make changes to individual accounts based on their display name. Here's an example that sets *Belinda Newman*'s usage location to *France*, but specifies her display name rather than her User Principal Name:
  
```powershell
$userName="<display name>"
$upn=(Get-MsolUser | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $userName}).UserPrincipalName
Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $upn -UsageLocation FR
```

### Change properties for all user accounts

To change properties for all users,  use a combination of the **Get-MsolUser** and **Set-MsolUser** cmdlets. The following example changes the usage location for all users to *France*:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser | Set-MsolUser -UsageLocation FR
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
1. Get all the information for the user accounts (**Get-MsolUser**) and send it to the next command (**|**).

1. Set the user location to France (**Set-MsolUser -UsageLocation FR**).

### Change properties for a specific set of user accounts
