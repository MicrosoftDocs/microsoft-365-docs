# Microsoft 365 Client App Support: Conditional Access

In the modern workplace, users can access your organization's resources using various devices and apps from anywhere. As a result, just focusing on who can access a resource is not sufficient anymore. Your organization must also support how and where a resource is accessed in your access control infrastructure.

With Azure Active Directory device, location, and multi-factor authentication-based Conditional Access, you can meet this new requirement. Conditional Access is a capability of Azure Active Directory that enables you to enforce controls on the access to apps in your environment, all based on specific conditions and managed from a central location.
