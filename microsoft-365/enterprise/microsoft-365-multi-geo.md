# Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo

With Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, your organization can expand its Microsoft 365 presence to multiple geographic regions and/or countries within your existing tenant. Reach out to your Microsoft Account Team to sign up your Multi-National Company for Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo.
  
With Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you can provision and store data at rest in the geo locations that you've chosen to meet data residency requirements, and at the same time unlock your global roll out of modern productivity experiences to your workforce.

For a video introduction to Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, see [SharePoint Online and OneDrive Multi-Geo to control where your data resides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do9U3JuROhk).

## Multi-Geo architecture

In a Multi-Geo environment, your Microsoft 365 tenant consists of a central location (where your Microsoft 365 subscription was originally provisioned) and one or more satellite locations. In a multi-geo tenant, the information about geo locations, groups, and user information, is mastered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Because your tenant information is mastered centrally and synchronized into each geo location, sharing and experiences involving anyone from your company contain global awareness.

Note that Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo is not designed for performance optimization, it is designed to meet data residency requirements.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get started with multi-geo:

1. Work with your account team to add the _Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365_ service plan. They will guide you to add the number of licenses needed. Multi-Geo feature is available to EA customers with a minimum of 250 Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

   Before you can start using Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, Microsoft needs to configure your Exchange Online tenant for multi-geo support. This one-time configuration process is triggered after you order the *Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365* service plan and the licenses show up in your tenant. You will receive workload-specific notifications in the [Microsoft 365 message center](https://support.office.com/article/38FB3333-BFCC-4340-A37B-DEDA509C2093) once your tenant has completed the configuration process for each workload, and you then may begin configuring and using your Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo capabilities. The time required to configure a tenant for Multi-Geo support varies from tenant to tenant, but most tenants finish within a month after receipt of the feature licenses. Larger or more complex tenants may require more time to complete the configuration process. Please contact your account team for details on your specific tenant should you require it.

2. Read [Plan your multi-geo environment](plan-for-multi-geo.md).

3. Learn about [administering a multi-geo environment](administering-a-multi-geo-environment.md) and [how your users will experience the environment](multi-geo-user-experience.md).

4. When you are ready to set up Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, [configure your tenant for multi-geo](multi-geo-tenant-configuration.md).

5. [Set up search](configure-search-for-multi-geo.md).
