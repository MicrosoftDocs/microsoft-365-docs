# Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo

The Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo Capabilities add-on provides Enterprise Agreement customers with the ability to expand their Microsoft 365 presence to multiple geographic regions within a single existing Microsoft 365 _Tenant_. Multi-Geo enables customers to manage data-at-rest locations at a granular level for their users, SharePoint sites, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Microsoft Teams teams level. Multi-Geo is targeted to customers who have a need to store data in multiple geographies to satisfy their data residency requirements.
  
Starting June 1, 2023, CSP partners can purchase Multi-Geo Capabilities for their customers who are using Microsoft 365, Office 365, Exchange, OneDrive and SharePoint subscriptions. With Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, CSP partners will be able to ensure their customers meet their data residency requirements.    
  
Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo is designed to meet your data residency requirements while retaining single-tenant administration and full-fidelity collaboration experiences between users as necessary.

## Multi-Geo architecture

In a Multi-Geo environment, your Microsoft 365 _Tenant_ consists of a central location (where your Microsoft 365 subscription was originally provisioned) and one or more satellite locations. In a Multi-Geo enabled _Tenant_, the information about geo locations, groups, and user information, is mastered in Microsoft Entra ID. Because your _Tenant_ information is mastered centrally and synchronized into each geo location, sharing and experiences involving anyone from your company contain global awareness.

***Note that Small Business products do not currently qualify for Multi-Geo, even if they contain elements of the above list.***

Note that _Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365_ is a user-level add-on license. You need a license for each user that you want to host in a _Satellite Geography_ location. You can add more licenses over time as you add users in _Satellite Geography_ locations.

There are no Multi-Geo licenses specific to shared resources such as SharePoint Sites, Microsoft 365 Groups, or Microsoft Teams teams. If enough Multi-Geo user licenses have been acquired, then customers are eligible to use Multi-Geo with shared resources without limitation.

## Getting started

Whether you're a CSP partner managing your customerâ€™s Microsoft 365 subscriptions or an Enterprise Agreement customer managing your own subscriptions, you can follow these steps to get started with Multi-Geo:

1. Ensure that you purchase Multi-Geo for at least 5% of the total eligible users in your Microsoft 365 subscription. Remember that you'll need a license for each user you want to host in a _Satellite Geography_ location. 

2. Before you can start using Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, Microsoft needs to configure your _Tenant_ for Multi-Geo support. This one-time automatic configuration process is triggered after you order the _Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365_ and the licenses show up in your _Tenant_. You'll receive workload-specific notifications in the [Microsoft 365 message center](https://support.office.com/article/38FB3333-BFCC-4340-A37B-DEDA509C2093) once the _Tenant_ has completed the configuration process for each workload, and then you may begin configuring and using your Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo capabilities. The time required to configure a _Tenant_ for Multi-Geo support varies from _Tenant_ to _Tenant_, but most _Tenants_ finish within a month after receipt of the feature licenses. Larger or more complex _Tenants_ may require more time to complete the configuration process.

3. Read [Plan your multi-geo environment](plan-for-multi-geo.md).

4. Learn about [administering a multi-geo environment](administering-a-multi-geo-environment.md) and [how your users will experience the environment](multi-geo-user-experience.md).

5. When you're ready to set up Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, [configure your tenant for multi-geo](multi-geo-tenant-configuration.md).

6. [Set up search](configure-search-for-multi-geo.md).
