# Identity and device access for your Microsoft 365 test environment

*This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environments.*

[Identity and device access configurations](../security/office-365-security/zero-trust-identity-device-access-policies-overview.md) are a set of recommended configurations and conditional access policies to protect access to all services that are integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.

To create a test environment that has the common identity and device access configurations in place:

1. Configure your test environment with the prerequisite identity and security features based on your choice of identity model and authentication method:

  - [Cloud only](cloud-only-prereqs-m365-test-environment.md)
  - [Password hash synchronization (PHS)](phs-prereqs-m365-test-environment.md)
  - [Pass-through authentication (PTA)](pta-prereqs-m365-test-environment.md)

2. Use [Common identity and device access policies](../security/office-365-security/zero-trust-identity-device-access-policies-common.md) to configure the policies that build on the prerequisites configured for your test environment and explore and verify protection for identities and devices.
