# Windows and Office 365 deployment lab kit

The Windows and Office 365 deployment lab kit is designed to help you plan, test, and validate your deployment and management of desktops running Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 11 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. The labs in the kit cover using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, the Office Customization Tool, OneDrive, Windows Autopilot, and more.

This kit is highly recommended for organizations preparing for Windows 8.1 upgrades to Windows 10. It also applies if you're currently using Windows 10, Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (formerly Office 365 ProPlus), or Office 2019. As an isolated environment, the resulting lab is ideal for exploring deployment tool updates and testing your deployment-related automation.

**Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions of the lab kit are now available for free download in the Microsoft Evaluation Center.**
