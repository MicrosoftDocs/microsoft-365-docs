# Windows and Office Deployment Lab Kit

These downloadable hands-on labs focus on Windows 10 deployment and Office 365 deployment along with related configuration and management considerations post-deployment.

Included are guides for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, Enterprise Mobility + Security and related products and services.
