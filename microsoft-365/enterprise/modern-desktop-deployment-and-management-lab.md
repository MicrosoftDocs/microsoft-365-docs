# Windows and Office Deployment Lab Kit

These labs are designed to help you plan, test, and validate your deployment and management of desktops running Windows 10 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. The labs cover using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, Office Customization Tool, OneDrive, Windows Autopilot and more.

This kit is highly recommended for organizations preparing for Windows 8 upgrades, and also applies if you're currently using Windows 10, Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (formerly Office 365 ProPlus), or Office 2019. Additionally, as an isolated environment, the lab is ideal for exploring deployment tool updates and testing your deployment-related automation.
