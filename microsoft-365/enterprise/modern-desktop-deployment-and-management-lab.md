# Modern Desktop Deployment and Management Lab Kit

These downloadable hands-on labs focus on Windows 10 deployment and Office 365 deployment along with the related configuration and management considerations post-deployment. This training is highly recommended for organizations preparing for Windows 7 end of life, but also applies if you’re currently using Windows 10 and Office 365 Plus or Office 2019. Included are guides for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, Enterprise Mobility + Security and related products and services.
