# Disable access to Microsoft 365 services with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

When a Microsoft 365 account is assigned a license from a licensing plan, Microsoft 365 services are made available to the user from that license. However, you can control the Microsoft 365 services that the user can access. For example, even though the license allows access to the SharePoint Online service, you can disable access to it. You can use PowerShell to disable access to any number of services for a specific licensing plan for:

- An individual account.
- A group of accounts.
- All accounts in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> There are Microsoft 365 service dependencies that can prevent you from disabling a specified service when other services depend on it.

## Use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](/graph/powershell/get-started#authentication).

Assigning and removing licenses for a user requires the **User.ReadWrite.All** permission scope or one of the other permissions listed in the ['Assign license' Graph API reference page](/graph/api/user-assignlicense).

The Organization.Read.All permission scope is required to read the licenses available in the tenant.

```powershell
Connect-Graph -Scopes User.ReadWrite.All, Organization.Read.All
```

Next, use this command to view your available licensing plans, also known as SkuPartNumber:

```powershell
Get-MgSubscribedSku | Select SkuId, SkuPartNumber, ServicePlans | Sort SkuPartNumber
```

For more information, see [View licenses and services with PowerShell](view-licenses-and-services-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).

To see the before and after results of the procedures in this topic, see [View account license and service details with PowerShell](view-account-license-and-service-details-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).

### Disable specific Microsoft 365 services for specific users for a specific licensing plan
  
To disable a specific set of Microsoft 365 services for users for a specific licensing plan, perform the following steps:
  
First list the licensing plans available in your tenant using the following command.

```powershell
Get-MgSubscribedSku | Select SkuPartNumber

SkuPartNumber
-------------
EMSPREMIUM
SPE_E5
RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC

```

Next, use the SkuPartNumber from the command above, list the service plans available for a given license plan (Sku).

The following example lists all the service plans available for **SPE_E5** (Microsoft 365 E5).

```powershell
Get-MgSubscribedSku -All | Where SkuPartNumber -eq 'SPE_E5' |  select -ExpandProperty ServicePlans
```

For a complete list of license plans (also known as product names), their included service plans, and their corresponding friendly names, see [Product names and service plan identifiers for licensing](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-service-plan-reference). (Search using the ServicePlanId to lookup service plan's corresponding friendly name).

The following example assigns **SPE_E5** (Microsoft 365 E5) with the **MICROSOFTBOOKINGS** (Microsoft Bookings) and **LOCKBOX_ENTERPRISE** (Customer Lockbox) services turned off:
  
```powershell
$e5Sku = Get-MgSubscribedSku -All | Where SkuPartNumber -eq 'SPE_E5'
$disabledPlans = $e5Sku.ServicePlans | `
    Where ServicePlanName -in ("LOCKBOX_ENTERPRISE", "MICROSOFTBOOKINGS") | `
    Select -ExpandProperty ServicePlanId

$addLicenses = @(
    @{
        SkuId = $e5Sku.SkuId
        DisabledPlans = $disabledPlans
    }
)

Set-MgUserLicense -UserId "belinda@litwareinc.com" -AddLicenses $addLicenses -RemoveLicenses @()
```

The `DisabledPlans` property of the `-AddLicenses` parameter in `Set-MgUserLicense` will overwrite the user's existing `DisabledPlans` value. To preserve the state of existing service plans, the user's current state of service plans must be merged with the new plans that are going to be disabled.

Failing to include the existing `DisabledPlans` will result in the user's previously disabled plan being enabled.

The following example updates a user with **SPE_E5** (Microsoft 365 E5) and turns off the Sway and Forms service plans while leaving the user's existing disabled plans in their current state:
  
```powershell
## Get the services that have already been disabled for the user.
$userLicense = Get-MgUserLicenseDetail -UserId "belinda@fdoau.onmicrosoft.com"
$userDisabledPlans = $userLicense.ServicePlans | `
    Where ProvisioningStatus -eq "Disabled" | `
    Select -ExpandProperty ServicePlanId

## Get the new service plans that are going to be disabled
$e5Sku = Get-MgSubscribedSku -All | Where SkuPartNumber -eq 'SPE_E5'
$newDisabledPlans = $e5Sku.ServicePlans | `
    Where ServicePlanName -in ("SWAY", "FORMS_PLAN_E5") | `
    Select -ExpandProperty ServicePlanId

## Merge the new plans that are to be disabled with the user's current state of disabled plans
$disabledPlans = ($userDisabledPlans + $newDisabledPlans) | Select -Unique

$addLicenses = @(
    @{
        SkuId = $e5Sku.SkuId
        DisabledPlans = $disabledPlans
    }
)
## Update user's license
Set-MgUserLicense -UserId "belinda@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com" -AddLicenses $addLicenses -RemoveLicenses @()
```
