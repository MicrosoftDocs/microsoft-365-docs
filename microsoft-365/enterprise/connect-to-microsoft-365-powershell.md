# Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

PowerShell for Microsoft 365 lets you manage your Microsoft 365 settings from the command line. Connecting to PowerShell is a simple process where you install the required software and then connect to your Microsoft 365 organization. 

There are two versions of the PowerShell module that you use to connect to Microsoft 365 and administer user accounts, groups, and licenses:

- Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph (cmdlets include **AzureAD** in their name)
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell (cmdlets include **MSol** in their name) 

As of the date of this article, the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module does not completely replace the functionality in the cmdlets of Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module for user, group, and license administration. In some cases, you need to use both versions. You can safely install both versions on the same computer.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

You can use the following versions of Windows:
    
  - Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) 
    
  - Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module, you must use PowerShell version 5.1 or later. For the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module, you must use PowerShell version 5.1 or later up to PowerShell version 6. You cannot use PowerShell version 7. For Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, download and install the [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616). 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Use a 64-bit version of Windows. Support for the 32-bit version the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell was discontinued in October of 2014.
    
These procedures are intended for users who are members of a Microsoft 365 admin role. For more information, see [About admin roles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532367).


## Connect with the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

Commands in the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module have **AzureAD** in their cmdlet name. You can install the [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) module or [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

For procedures that require the new cmdlets in the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module, use these steps to install the module and connect to your Microsoft 365 subscription.

> [!Note]
> See [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) for information about the support for different versions of Microsoft Windows.

### Step 1: Install required software

These steps are required once on your computer, not every time you connect. However, you'll likely need to install newer versions of the software periodically.
  
1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell command prompt (run Windows PowerShell as an administrator).
    
2. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** command window, run this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name AzureAD
  ```

If prompted about installing a module from an untrusted repository, type **Y** and press ENTER.

### Step 2: Connect to Azure AD for your Microsoft 365 subscription

To connect to Azure AD for your Microsoft 365 subscription with an account name and password or with multi-factor authentication (MFA), run one of these commands from a Windows PowerShell command prompt (it does not have to be elevated).

| Office 365 cloud | Command |
|:-------|:-----|
| Office 365 Worldwide (+GCC) | `Connect-AzureAD` |
| Office 365 operated by 21 Vianet | `Connect-AzureAD -AzureEnvironmentName AzureChinaCloud` |
| Office 365 Germany | `Connect-AzureAD -AzureEnvironmentName AzureGermanyCloud` |
| Office 365 U.S. Government DoD and Office 365 U.S. Government GCC High | `Connect-AzureAD -AzureEnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment` |
|||

In the **Sign into your account** dialog box, type your Microsoft 365 work or school account user name and password, and then click **OK**.

If you are using MFA, follow the instructions in the additional dialog boxes to provide more authentication information, such as a verification code.

After connecting, you can use the cmdlets for the [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azuread/v2/azureactivedirectory).
  

## Connect with the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

Commands in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell have **Msol** in their cmdlet name.

PowerShell version 7 and later do not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. For PowerShell version 7 and later, you must use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module or Azure PowerShell.

PowerShell Core does not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. To continue using these cmdlets, you must run them from Windows PowerShell. 
    
### Step 1: Install required software

These steps are required once on your computer, not every time you connect. However, you'll likely need to install newer versions of the software periodically.
  
1.  If you are not running Windows 10, install the 64-bit version of the Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant: [Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant for IT Professionals RTW](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=286152).
    
2. Install the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell with these steps:
    
  - Open an elevated Windows PowerShell command prompt (run Windows PowerShell as an administrator).
  - Run the **Install-Module MSOnline** command.
  - If prompted to install the NuGet provider, type **Y** and press ENTER.
  - If prompted to install the module from PSGallery, type **Y** and press ENTER.
    
### Step 2: Connect to Azure AD for your Microsoft 365 subscription

To connect to Azure AD for your Microsoft 365 subscription with an account name and password or with multi-factor authentication (MFA), run one of these commands from a Windows PowerShell command prompt (it does not have to be elevated).

| Office 365 cloud | Command |
|:-------|:-----|
| Office 365 Worldwide (+GCC) | `Connect-MsolService` |
| Office 365 operated by 21 Vianet | `Connect-MsolService -AzureEnvironment AzureChinaCloud` |
| Office 365 Germany | `Connect-MsolService -AzureEnvironment AzureGermanyCloud` |
| Office 365 U.S. Government DoD and Office 365 U.S. Government GCC High | `Connect-MsolService -AzureEnvironment USGovernment` |
|||

In the **Sign into your account** dialog box, type your Microsoft 365 work or school account user name and password, and then click **OK**.

If you are using MFA, follow the instructions in the additional dialog boxes to provide more authentication information, such as a verification code.

### How do you know this worked?

If you don't receive any errors, you connected successfully. A quick test is to run a Microsoft 365 cmdlet—for example, **Get-MsolUser** —and see the results.
  
If you receive errors, check the following requirements:
  
- **A common problem is an incorrect password**. Run Step 2 again. and pay close attention to the user name and password you enter.
    
- **The Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell requires that the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.*x* feature is enabled on your computer**. It's likely that your computer has a newer version installed (for example, 4 or 4.5.*x*), but backwards compatibility with older versions of the .NET Framework can be enabled or disabled. For more information, see the following topics:
    
  - For Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2, see [Enable .NET Framework 3.5 by using the Add Roles and Features Wizard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532368)
    
  - For Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, see [You can't open the Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532370)

  - For Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8, see [Install the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/install/dotnet-35-windows-10)

  
- **Your version of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell might be out of date.** To check, run the following command in PowerShell for Microsoft 365 or the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell:
    
  ```powershell
  (Get-Item C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\MSOnline\Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.PSModule.dll).VersionInfo.FileVersion
  ```

    If the version number returned is lower than the value 1.0.8070.2, uninstall the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell and install from Step 1 above.

- **If you receive a connection error, see this topic:** ["Connect-MsolService: Exception of type was thrown" error](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532377).
    
- **If you receive a "Get-Item : Cannot find path" error, use this command:** 

```powershell
  (dir "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\MSOnline").Name
```
