# Microsoft 365 Enterprise Workloads

To realize the creativity and teamwork benefits of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, deploy these workloads to operate on the top of your Microsoft 365 Enterprise foundation infrastructure:

- [Microsoft Teams](teams-workload.md)
- [Exchange Online](exchangeonline-workload.md)
- SharePoint Online (coming soon)
