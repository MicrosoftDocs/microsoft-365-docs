# Microsoft 365 Enterprise workloads and scenarios

To realize the creativity and teamwork benefits of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, deploy these workloads and scenarios to operate on the top of your Microsoft 365 Enterprise foundation infrastructure:

- [Microsoft Teams](teams-workload.md)
- [Exchange Online](exchangeonline-workload.md)
- SharePoint Online (coming soon)
- [Migration to Microsoft 365 Enterprise](migration-microsoft-365-enterprise-workload.md)
- Client updates (coming soon)


The following figure shows the workloads in the overall Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment content.

You should deploy workloads after you have gone through the phases of the [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md).
