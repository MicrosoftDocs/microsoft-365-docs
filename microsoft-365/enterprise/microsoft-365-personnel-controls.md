# Microsoft 365 personnel controls

Microsoft works to maintain a safe and secure environment that properly protects our employees, customers, property, personal data, and proprietary information. A comprehensive background screening program is essential for achieving this goal. All candidates for employment and internship are required to satisfactorily complete a background screening prior to commencing employment at Microsoft. Current employees in specific roles may also be subject to periodic re-screening.

## The Microsoft Personnel Screening Standard

The Microsoft Personnel Screening Standard applies to all Microsoft employees, interns, and contingent staff involved in the development, operation, or delivery of online services to government or commercial cloud customers.

The personnel screening practices for Microsoft 365 align with Microsoft's corporate standards and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) controls for personnel screening. Microsoft staff who require access to the following are subject to the Microsoft Personnel Screening Standard:

- Physical access to datacenters, colocations, secured rooms, cages, server racks, or edge sites that provide the infrastructure supporting online services for government or commercial cloud customers.
- Logical access to government or commercial cloud customer data provided through specific managed environments.
- Network management access to devices and services that transport or store government or commercial cloud customer data.

In countries with robust privacy laws that restrict access to personal information, staff involved in the development, operation, or delivery of online services to government or commercial cloud customers may be subject to additional checks. Specific personnel-related events that trigger screening requirements include:

- New Microsoft staff placed in roles where screening is a defined requirement.
- Internal Microsoft staff transferred or moved to an existing role that currently includes screening as a defined requirement.
- Existing roles that change scope to include screening as a defined requirement.

## Microsoft pre-employment screening

Microsoft's Global Security Department is responsible for ensuring candidates are background screened before commencing employment with Microsoft.
To the extent permissible by local law the checks include the following:

- SSN trace in the United States or confirmation of identity from a government-issued document in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Criminal history check up to seven years for felony and misdemeanor offenses at the state, county, and local levels, and at the federal level if appropriate in the United States. An international criminal history check (dependent on local law) is applicable for areas outside of the United States.
- Confirmation of highest level of academic achievement
- 5-year employment history
- Global sanctions and enforcement check, including Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) list, and Office of Defense Trade Controls Debarred Persons (DDTC) list checks.

## Periodic re-screening

Periodic re-screening and/or additional background checks may be required for certain management, security, or other roles, including employees in roles that require access to customer data (See Cloud Background Check).

## Supplier screening

Microsoft requires that Suppliers (contingent staff) conduct pre-placement background checks on all their personnel who will perform services or projects that require any access to Microsoft owned or leased facilities or access to Microsoft resources such as email, network access, cardkey, or other access badges.

To the extent permissible by local law Supplier Screening checks include the following:

- SSN trace in the United States or confirmation of identity from a government-issued document in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Criminal history check up to seven years for felony and misdemeanor offenses at the state, county, and local levels, and at the federal level if appropriate in the United States. An international criminal history check (dependent on local law) is applicable for areas outside of the United States.
- Confirmation of highest level of academic achievement
- Global sanctions and enforcement check

In the United States prior to each placement of each supplier staff member to perform for Microsoft, to the extent permissible by local law, Supplier will conduct a pre-placement, and for certain placements, periodic, background check utilizing Microsoft's preferred background check screening service provider who will confirm to Microsoft that the screening meets the Microsoft standard. 

Internationally, the foregoing requirement will be implemented in all countries by September 2020 and where not currently implemented, the contract with the third party specifies Microsoft's requirements for screening that must be conducted and the Supplier is responsible for attesting to Microsoft in writing that the background check has been successfully completed.

## Microsoft cloud background check

A Microsoft Cloud Background Check is required for candidates hired as employees providing Microsoft 365-related services in the United States. Microsoft employees in the United States with access to customer data must follow the Microsoft Cloud Background Check process required by all Microsoft 365 services. Outside of the United States, the process varies. For example, the Microsoft Cloud for Germany uses a Data Trustee approval model, designed to ensure that the Data Trustee (a German company), and not Microsoft, is in control of access to customer data. The Microsoft Cloud in Germany is delivered from datacenters in Germany, and the Operations Centers (OC) containing the technical staff of the Data Trustee are also in Germany. Both the datacenter and the OC facilities are operated, maintained and controlled by the Data Trustee.

To the extent permissible by local law, the following checks are performed as part of the Microsoft Cloud Background Check.

- United States: Social Security Number trace
- Criminal history check up to seven years for felony and misdemeanor offenses at the state, county, and local levels, and at the federal level if appropriate in the United States. An international criminal history check (dependent on local law) is applicable for areas outside of the United States.
- Global sanctions and enforcement check, including Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) list, and Office of Defense Trade Controls Debarred Persons (DDTC) list checks.

The results from the Microsoft Cloud Background Check are stored in our employee database and connected to our datacenter access control systems. If the Microsoft Cloud Background Check expires and the employee does not renew it, access to Microsoft 365 services is revoked and no longer available until the Microsoft Cloud Background Check is completed. When the employment relationship with Microsoft ends, all datacenter access is immediately revoked.

United States citizenship is verified for all employees with physical or logical access to the Microsoft 365 United States Government services. To verify citizenship, employees and/or new hire candidates meet with a U.S. Citizenship Delegate who is trained to review documentation verifying U.S. citizenship. Employees or new hire candidates must bring the required documentation and sign an attestation form at a meeting with the Citizenship Delegate for their region. The meeting must be done in person. Once the individual has met with the Citizenship Delegate and provided the necessary documentation and signatures, the Citizenship Delegate forwards a copy of the documents to Microsoft Staffing Operations who submit the copy to record keeping.

Personnel with logical access to the Microsoft 365 U.S. Government Community Cloud, or logical or physical access to the Azure U.S. government offerings, are required to comply with federal government requirements of the FBI's [Criminal Justice Information Services](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis) (CJIS), including personnel screening. CJIS screening in support of the Microsoft 365 U.S. Government service includes a fingerprint-based criminal background check adjudicated by the CJIS system agency designated adjudicator in [states that have enrolled](https://blogs.office.com/2013/10/23/california-and-microsoft-sign-cjis-security-policy-agreement/) in the Microsoft Online Services CJIS support program.
