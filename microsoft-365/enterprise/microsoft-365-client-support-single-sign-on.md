# Microsoft 365 Client App Support: Single Sign-On

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

Single sign-on (SSO) adds security and convenience when your users sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory. With single sign-on, users sign in once with one account to access on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain-joined devices, software as a service (SaaS) applications, and web applications.
