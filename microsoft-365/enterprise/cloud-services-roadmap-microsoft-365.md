# Cloud services roadmap for Microsoft 365

To get the creativity, teamwork, and productivity benefits of Microsoft 365 for enterprise, deploy the cloud services that best fit your organization's needs.

If you have existing server-based deployments for Exchange, SharePoint, or Skype for Business, see the [client and server software roadmap](client-server-software-roadmap-microsoft-365.md) to migrate your entire organization to Microsoft 365 for enterprise. This roadmap includes Microsoft Office client products, on-premises Office Server products, and Microsoft Windows-based devices.
