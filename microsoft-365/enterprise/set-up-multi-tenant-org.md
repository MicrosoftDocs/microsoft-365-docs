# Set up a multitenant org in Microsoft 365 (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Multitenant organizations in Microsoft 365 is available in [targeted release](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365).

You can set up a multitenant organization or add tenants to an existing one in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

When each external tenant accepts the invitation to join the multitenant organization, the following settings are configured in Microsoft Entra ID:

- A cross-tenant synchronization configuration is added with the name *MTO_Sync_\<TenantID\>*, but no sync jobs are created yet. (If you already have a cross-tenant synchronization configuration, it remains unchanged.)
- An organization relationship is added to the [cross-tenant access settings](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview) based on the [multitenant organization templates](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-templates) for cross-tenant access and identity synchronization. (If an organizational relationship already exists, the existing one is used.)
- The multitenant organization template for identity synchronization is set to allow users to sync into this tenant.
- The multitenant org template for cross-tenant access will be set to automatically redeem user invitations, inbound as well as outbound.
