# Other endpoints not included in the Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service

Some network endpoints were previously published and haven't been included in the [Office 365 IP Address and URL Web Service](microsoft-365-ip-web-service.md). The web service publishes network endpoints that are required for Office 365 connectivity across an enterprise perimeter network. This scope currently doesn't include:

1. Network connectivity that may be required from a Microsoft datacenter to a customer network (inbound hybrid server network traffic).
2. Network connectivity from servers on a customer network across the enterprise perimeter (outbound server network traffic).
3. Uncommon scenarios for network connectivity requirements from a user.
4. DNS resolution connectivity requirement (not listed below).
5. Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge Trusted Sites.

Apart from DNS, these instances are all optional for most customers unless you need the specific scenario that is described.

If you need to allow inbound connections only from specific source IP ranges, create a permit rule for the IP addresses listed in the **Exchange Online** table in [Office 365 URL & IP ranges](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md). <p> To ensure that connectivity to published EWS endpoints (like OWA) is not blocked, make sure the MRS proxy resolves to a separate FQDN and public IP address before you restrict connections.|Customer on-premises EWS/MRS Proxy <br> TCP port 443|Inbound server traffic|
