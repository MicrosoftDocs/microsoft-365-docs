# Pass-through authentication for your Microsoft 365 test environment

*This Test Lab Guide can be used for both Microsoft 365 for enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise test environments.*

Organizations that want to directly use their on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) infrastructure for authentication to Microsoft cloud-based services and applications can use pass-through authentication. This article describes how you can configure your Microsoft 365 test environment for pass-through authentication, resulting in the following configuration:
  
![The simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication test environment.](../media/pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment/Phase2.png)
  
There are two phases to setting up this test environment:

1.    Create the Microsoft 365 simulated enterprise test environment with password hash synchronization.
2.    Configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 for pass-through authentication.

## Phase 1: Configure password hash synchronization for your Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in [password hash synchronization for Microsoft 365](password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md). Here is your resulting configuration.
  
![The simulated enterprise with password hash synchronization test environment.](../media/pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment/Phase1.png)
  
This configuration consists of: 
  
- Microsoft 365 E5 trial or paid subscription.
- A simplified organization intranet connected to the Internet, consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual network. Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize the TESTLAB AD DS domain to the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 subscription periodically.

## Phase 2: Configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 for pass-through authentication

In this phase, you configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 to use pass-through authentication, and then verify that it works.

### Configure Azure AD Connect on APP1

1.    From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your global administrator account, and then connect to APP1 with the TESTLAB\User1 account.

2.    From the desktop of APP1, run Azure AD Connect.

3.    On the **Welcome page**, click **Configure**.

4.    On the Additional tasks page, click **Change user sign-in**, and then click **Next**.

5.    On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, type your global administrator account credentials, and then click **Next**.

6.    On the **User sign-in** page, click **Pass-through authentication**, and then click **Next**.

7.    On the **Ready to configure** page, click **Configure**.

8.    On the **Configuration complete** page, click **Exit**.

9.    From the Azure portal, in the left pane, click **Azure Active Directory > Azure AD Connect**. Verify that the **Pass-through authentication** feature appears as **Enabled**.

10.    Click **Pass-through authentication**. The **Pass-through authentication** pane lists the servers where your Authentication Agents are installed. You should see APP1 in the list. Close the **Pass-through authentication** pane.

Next, test the ability to sign in to your subscription with the <strong>user1@testlab.</strong>\<your public domain> user name of the User1 account.

1. From APP1, sign out, and then sign in again, this time specifying a different account.

2. When prompted for a user name and password, specify <strong>user1@testlab.</strong>\<your public domain> and the User1 password. You should successfully sign in as User1.

Notice that although User1 has domain administrator permissions for the TESTLAB AD DS domain, it is not a global administrator. Therefore, you will not see the **Admin** icon as an option.

Here is your resulting configuration:

![The simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication test environment.](../media/pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment/Phase2.png)
 
This configuration consists of:

- A Microsoft 365 E5 trial or paid subscriptions with the DNS domain testlab.\<your domain name> registered.
- A simplified organization intranet connected to the Internet, consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual network. An Authentication Agent runs on APP1 to handle pass-through authentication requests from the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 subscription.
