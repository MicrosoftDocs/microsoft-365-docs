# Contoso's IT infrastructure and business needs

Contoso has been transitioning from an on-premises, centralized IT infrastructure to a cloud-inclusive one that incorporates cloud-based personal productivity workloads and applications.

## Contoso's existing IT infrastructure

Contoso uses a mostly centralized on-premises IT infrastructure, with application datacenters in the Paris headquarters.

Figure 1 shows a headquarters office with application datacenters, a DMZ, and the Internet.

The on-premises application datacenters host: 

- Custom line of business applications that use SQL Server and other Linux databases.
- A set of legacy SharePoint servers.
- Organization and team-level servers for file storage.

Additionally, each regional hub office supports a set of servers with a similar set of applications. These servers are under the control of regional IT departments.

Searchability across the applications and data of these separate multi-geographical datacenters continues to be a challenge.

In Contoso's headquarters DMZ, different sets of servers provide:

- Hosting for the Contoso public web site, from which customers can order products, parts, supplies, or service.
- Hosting for the Contoso partner extranet for partner communication and collaboration.
- Virtual private network (VPN)-based remote access to the Contoso intranet and web proxying for workers in the Paris headquarters.

## Contoso's business needs

Contoso's business needs fall into five main categories.

Productivity:

- Make collaboration easier

  Replace the email and file share-based collaboration with an online model that allows real-time changes on documents, easier online meetings, and captured conversation threads.
- Improve productivity for remote and mobile workers

  With many employees working from homes or in the field, replace the bottlenecked VPN solution with performant access to Contoso data and resources in the cloud.
- Increase creativity and innovation

  Take advantage of the latest visual learning and idea development methods, including inking and 3D visualization.

Security:

- Identity and access management

  Enforce multi-factor and other forms of authentication and protect user and administrator account credentials.

- Threat protection

  Protect against external security threats, including email and operating system-based malware.

- Information protection

  Lock down access to and encrypt high-value digital assets, such as customer data, design and manufacturing specifications, and employee information.

- Security management

  Monitor security posture and be able to detect and respond to threats in real time.

Remote and mobile access and business partners:

- Better security for remote and mobile workers

  Institute Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and company-owned device management to ensure secured access, correct application behavior, and company data protection.

- Reduce remote access infrastructure for employees

  Reduce maintenance and support costs and improve performance for remote access solution by moving commonly-accessed resources to the cloud.

- Provide better connectivity and lower overhead for Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions

  Replace aging and expensive partner extranet with a cloud-based solution that uses federated authentication.

Compliance:

- Adhere to regional regulatory requirements

  Become and remain compliant with industry and regional regulations for data storage, encryption, data privacy, and personal data regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the Europe Union.

Management:

- Lower the IT overhead for managing software running on client PCs and devices

  Automate the installation of updates to the Windows operating system and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise across the organization.

## Mapping Contoso's business needs to Microsoft 365 for enterprise

Contoso's IT department determined the following mapping of business needs to Microsoft 365 E5 features prior to deployment:
