# Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides

Test Lab Guides (TLGs) help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They provide prescriptive instructions to configure simplified but representative test environments. You can use these environments for demonstration, customization, or creation of complex proofs of concept for the duration of a trial or paid subscription. 

TLGs are designed to be modular. They build upon each other to create multiple configurations that more closely match your learning or test configuration needs. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or scenario so you can better plan for hosting it in production.

You can also use TLGs to create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

## Base configuration

First, you create a test environment for [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-enterprise/) that includes Office 365 E5, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5, and Windows 10 Enterprise. You can create two different types of base configurations:

- Use the [lightweight base configuration](lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md) when you want to configure and demonstrate Microsoft 365 Enterprise features and capabilities in a cloud-only environment, which does not include any on-premises components.

- Use the [simulated enterprise base configuration](simulated-ent-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md) when you want to configure and demonstrate Microsoft 365 Enterprise features and capabilities in a hybrid cloud environment, which uses on-premises components such as a Windows Server Active Directory (AD) domain.
    
## Identity

To demonstrate identity-related features and capabilities, see:

- [Password hash synchronization](password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md)
  
   Enable and test password hash-based directory synchronization from a Windows Server AD domain controller.

- [Pass-through authentication](pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md)
  
   Enable and test pass-through authentication to a Windows Server AD domain controller.

- [Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-on](single-sign-on-m365-ent-test-environment.md)
  
   Enable and test Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-on (SSO) with a Windows Server AD domain controller.

- [Multi-factor authentication](multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365-test-environment.md)
  
   Enable and test smart phone-based multi-factor authentication for a specific user account.

- [Protect global administrator accounts](protect-global-administrator-accounts-microsoft-365-test-environment.md)
 
   Lock down your global administrator accounts with Office 365 Cloud App Security and conditional access policies.

- [Password reset](password-reset-m365-ent-test-environment.md)

   Use self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset your password.

- [Automatic licensing and group membership](automate-licenses-group-membership-microsoft-365-test-environment.md)

   Make administering new accounts easier than ever with automatic licensing and dynamic group membership.

- [Azure AD Identity Protection](azure-ad-identity-protection-microsoft-365-test-environment.md)

   Scan your current user accounts for vulnerabilities.



## Mobile device management

To demonstrate mobile device management-related features and capabilities, see:

- [MAM policies for your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment](mam-policies-for-your-microsoft-365-enterprise-dev-test-environment.md)
    
   Create user groups and mobile application management (MAM) policies for iOS and Android devices.
    
- [Enroll iOS and Android devices in your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment](enroll-ios-and-android-devices-in-your-microsoft-enterprise-365-dev-test-environ.md)
   
   Enroll iOS or Android devices and manage them remotely.
