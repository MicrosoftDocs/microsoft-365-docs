# Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides

Test Lab Guides (TLGs) help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They provide prescriptive instructions to configure simplified but representative test environments. You can use these environments for demonstration, customization, or creation of complex proofs of concept for the duration of a trial or paid subscription. 

TLGs are designed to be modular. They build upon each other to create multiple configurations that more closely match your learning or test configuration needs. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or scenario so you can better plan for hosting it in production.

You can also use TLGs to create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.
