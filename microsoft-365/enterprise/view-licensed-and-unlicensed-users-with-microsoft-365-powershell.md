# View licensed and unlicensed Microsoft 365 users with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

User accounts in your Microsoft 365 organization may have some, all, or none of the available licenses assigned to them from the licensing plans that are available in your organization. You can use PowerShell for Microsoft 365 to quickly find the licensed and unlicensed users in your organization.

## Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module).
 
To view the list of all user accounts in your organization that have NOT been assigned any of your licensing plans (unlicensed users), run the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureAdUser | ForEach{ $licensed=$False ; For ($i=0; $i -le ($_.AssignedLicenses | Measure).Count ; $i++) { If( [string]::IsNullOrEmpty(  $_.AssignedLicenses[$i].SkuId ) -ne $True) { $licensed=$true } } ; If( $licensed -eq $false) { Write-Host $_.UserPrincipalName} }
```

To view the list of all user accounts in your organization that have been assigned any of your licensing plans (licensed users), run the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureAdUser | ForEach { $licensed=$False ; For ($i=0; $i -le ($_.AssignedLicenses | Measure).Count ; $i++) { If( [string]::IsNullOrEmpty(  $_.AssignedLicenses[$i].SkuId ) -ne $True) { $licensed=$true } } ; If( $licensed -eq $true) { Write-Host $_.UserPrincipalName} }
```

>[!Note]
>To list all of the users in your subscription, use the `Get-AzureAdUser -All $true` command.
>

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

To view the list of all user accounts and their licensing status in your organization, run the following command in PowerShell:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -All
```

>[!Note]
>PowerShell Core does not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. To continue using these cmdlets, you must run them from Windows PowerShell.
>

To view the list of all unlicensed user accounts in your organization, run the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -All -UnlicensedUsersOnly
```

To view the list of all licensed user accounts in your organization, run the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -All | where {$_.isLicensed -eq $true}
```
