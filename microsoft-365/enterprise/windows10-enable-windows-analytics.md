Windows Analytics uses diagnostic data to provide rich, actionable information to help you gain deep insights into the operational efficiency and health of Windows 10 devices in your environment.

The Device Health capability of Windows Analytics provides proactive insights to help detect and remediate issues affecting end users. This new service uses diagnostic data to provide such insights without additional infrastructure requirements. Proactively remediating end-user issues enables you to reduce support costs and improve efficiency. Look for additional features to be released soon, which will enhance the capabilities and value of this new service.

See [Monitor the health of devices with Device Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/device-health-monitor) to learn more, get started, and use Device Health.
