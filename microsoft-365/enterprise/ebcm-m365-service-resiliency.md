# Built in resiliency

As your cloud collaboration provider, Microsoft recognizes the need to continuously earn your trust by providing solutions that function consistently and that your users love. When any given service is unavailable, this is called downtime. The definition of downtime varies for each Microsoft 365 service, but they commonly focus on any period of time when users are unable to use the essential functionality of the service. For example, here's the definition of downtime for SharePoint Online taken from the Microsoft 365 service level agreement:

**"SharePoint Online Downtime**: Any period of time when users are unable to read or write any portion of a SharePoint Online site collection for which they have appropriate permissions."

You can find the downtime definitions for each service in the [Service Level Agreements](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=37).

To minimize downtime, either planned or unexpected, Microsoft 365 services are designed and operated to be highly available and resilient to failure by focusing on four areas:

## Active/Active design

In Microsoft 365 we are driving towards having all services architected and operated in an active/active design which increases resiliency. This means that there are always multiple instances of a service running that can respond to user requests and that they are hosted in geographically dispersed datacenters. All user traffic comes in through the Microsoft Front Door service and is automatically routed to the optimally located instance of the service and around any service failures to prevent or reduce impact to our customers.

## Reduce incident scope

The scope of a service incident is measured by how severe it is, how long it lasts and how many customers are impacted. We strive to limit the scope of all incidents by:

- having multiple instances of each service partitioned off from each other
- deploying updates in a controlled, graduated fashion using rings of validation so that any issues that might arise from the update can be detected and mitigated early in the deployment process. This allows for regression of the update if needed and first occurs in a small group inside Microsoft (inner ring) before it is deployed to larger groups like all 140,000 Microsoft employees (ring 2), then to early adopter rings (ring 3) and ultimately to all customers globally (ring 4).
- driving improvements in monitoring through automation. Microsoft 365 is very large, and the SLA target uptime is high. At the very beginning of a service incident, if humans had to be involved in detection and response, we couldn't respond fast enough to meet SLAs. Automation is the key to fast and effective service incident detection and response. The sooner we know about something, the faster it can be fixed.

Along with the active/active capabilities built into Microsoft 365 service architecture, these efforts mitigate the severity, duration and number of impacted customers during a service incident.  

## Fault isolation

Just as the services are designed and operated in an active/active fashion and are partitioned off from each other to prevent a failure in one from affecting another, the code base of the service is developed using similar partitioning principles called fault isolation. Fault isolation measures are incremental protections made within the code base itself. These measures help prevent an issue in one area from cascading into other areas of operation.
Fault isolation measures are applied at multiple stages of the development and delivery of a service, including code development, service deployment, load balancing and database replication.

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) further promotes resiliency and consists of a set of practices that support security and compliance requirements. SDL guides our developers in building resilient, secure, compliant services. Key elements of SDL include code reviews, threat modeling, penetration testing, and standardized incident response processes across the Microsoft cloud.

M365 services are highly interconnected, but the systems and technology behind them are engineered in a way that limits the impact of one service incident from spilling over to other services. For example, an issue affecting Exchange Online will not impact core functionality in Teams, or an issue with search functionality in SharePoint Online won’t affect users’ ability to upload or download files.

## Continuous service improvement

When we experience an incident, we take it seriously. After all, our redundant cloud architecture and rigorous internal processes aim to keep our services accessible. During an incident, our monitoring rapidly detects the affected services and, if your tenant is affected, you'll be notified immediately through a variety of channels. Simultaneously, engineers follow well-defined processes to triage the issue and take the necessary steps to restore normal operation as quickly as possible. Once the service is functioning normally again, we hold post incident reviews as part of the cycle of continuous service improvement. During the post incident review, we identify the root causes of the incident and what was required to fix the issues. Then we take what was learned from the situation and apply it to the design and operations of all of our suite of offerings. By doing this, we can prevent the same root cause from impacting other services and additional customers.
