# Deployment of Microsoft 365 Enterprise with existing infrastructure

This article steps through each phase of the deployment of Microsoft 365 Enterprise so you can quickly determine how to adapt or change your existing infrastructure.

Before you can exit each phase, you must examine its exit criteria, which is a set of required conditions that you must meet and optional conditions to consider. Exit criteria for each phase ensures that your on-premises and cloud infrastructure and resulting end-to-end configuration meets the requirements for a Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment.
