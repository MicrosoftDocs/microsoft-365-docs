# Deployment and update channel example configurations

Choosing which update channels to use for Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps can depend on your type of organization and where on the development cycle you want to be deploying and using new features and capabilities. Find the pre-release and production channels that best fit your needs.

## Pre-release channels

| Customer/Channel Offering | Windows 10 | Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise (Windows 10) |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|
| Right for highly technical users and developers. ​<br><br> Be the first to access the latest builds earliest in the development cycle with the newest code. ​<br><br> There will be rough edges and some instability. | Dev | N/A |
| Right for early adopters and IT Pros who want more reliable builds that are still in development. ​<br><br> See what’s coming up next and help validate new features. | Beta Channel | Beta Channel |
| Right for those who want early access to upcoming releases. ​<br><br> Where companies preview and validate upcoming releases before broad deployment. ​<br><br> These are supported. <br>  | Release Preview | Current Channel (Preview) <br><br> Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview)|
