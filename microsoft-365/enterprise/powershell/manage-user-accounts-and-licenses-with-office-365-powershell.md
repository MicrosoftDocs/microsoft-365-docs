# Manage Microsoft 365 user accounts, licenses, and groups with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

One of the primary tasks of any Microsoft 365 administrator is managing user accounts, licenses, and groups. Although you can accomplish most aspects of these tasks in the Microsoft 365 admin center, other tasks are much quicker and easier with PowerShell.
