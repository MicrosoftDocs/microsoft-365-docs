# Phase 2: Identity

![Phase 2: Identity](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/identity_icon.png)

In Microsoft 365 Enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

Watch this video for an overview of identity models and authentication for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

>[!Note]
>If you’ve already deployed an identity infrastructure, please see the [identity exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) to make sure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

For the identity features of each Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan, the role of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), on-premises and cloud-based components, and the most common authentication configurations, see the [Identity Infrastructure poster](media/identity-infrastructure/M365E-ID-Infra.pdf).

[![The Identity Infrastructure poster](./media/identity-infrastructure/m365e-identity-arch-poster.png)](media/identity-infrastructure/M365E-ID-Infra.pdf)

This two-page poster is a quick way to ramp up on identity concepts and configurations for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

You can also [download this poster](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/enterprise/media/identity-infrastructure/M365E-ID-Infra.pdf) and print it in letter, legal, or tabloid (11 x 17) formats.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure 

Use the following steps to plan and deploy your new identity infrastructure in the cloud. You can also use these steps to adapt your existing on-premises or hybrid identity infrastructure to work with Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

|:-------|:-----|
|![Step 1](./media/stepnumbers/Step1.png)| [Create and protect your global admin accounts](identity-create-protect-global-admins.md) |
|![Step 2](./media/stepnumbers/Step2.png)| [Secure your passwords](identity-secure-your-passwords.md) |
|![Step 3](./media/stepnumbers/Step3.png)| [Secure and manage your user sign-ins](identity-secure-user-sign-ins.md) |
|![Step 4](./media/stepnumbers/Step4.png)| [Add your user accounts](identity-add-user-accounts.md) |
|![Step 5](./media/stepnumbers/Step5.png)| [Use groups for management](identity-use-group-management.md) |
|![Step 6](./media/stepnumbers/Step6.png)| [Configure identity governance](identity-configure-identity-governance.md) |

When you've completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity.

## Identity and device access recommendations

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. For identity, use the recommendations and settings in the following articles along with the steps in this phase:

- [Prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md)
