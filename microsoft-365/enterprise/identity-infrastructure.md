# Phase 2: Identity

![](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/identity_icon.png)

In Microsoft 365 Enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

>[!Note]
>If you’ve already deployed an identity infrastructure, please see the [identity exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) to make sure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure 

Use the following steps to plan and deploy your new identity infrastructure in the cloud. You can also use these steps to adapt your existing on-premises or hybrid identity infrastructure to work with Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

When you've completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Identity and device access recommendations

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. For identity, use the recommendations and settings in the following articles along with the steps in this phase:

- [Prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md)
