# Step 13: Monitor tenant and sign-in activity

*This step is optional and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In Step 13, you'll review audit logs and sign-in activity using Azure AD reporting. Two types of reports are available.

The **Audit logs activity report** records the history of every task performed in your Azure AD tenant. This report answers questions like:

- Who added someone to an admin group?
- Which users are signing into a specific app?
- How many password resets are happening?

The **Sign-ins activity report** records who performed the tasks reported by the audit logs report. This report answers questions like:

- For a specific user under investigation, what is their sign-in pattern?
- What is my volume of sign-ins over a day, week, or month?
- How many of these sign-in attempts were not successful, and for which accounts?

For more information about the reports and how to access them, see [Azure Active Directory reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-azure-portal).

As a result of this step, you'll gain awareness of these reports and an understanding of how you can use them to gain insights on Azure AD events and activities for planning and security purposes.
