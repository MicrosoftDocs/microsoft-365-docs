# How to request your data move

> [!NOTE]
> The information on this page only applies to customers who had existing Microsoft 365 tenants before the new datacenters in their geo launched. Migration eligibility also depends on the specific workload provisioning date, so tenant creation date may not always be the single date that matters.
  
Existing Microsoft 365 customers are eligible to request migration for their entire organizationâ€™s core customer data at rest.

## How to request a move

Eligible customers will see a page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://aka.ms/365admin), which will allow them to request to have their core customer data moved to their new datacenter region.  
  
To access the page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the navigation pane on the left, expand **Settings**, and then click **Org Settings**.
Select the tab **Organization profile**, then select the option **Data residency**.
  
**You may not see this section if one of the following apply**:
- Your tenant is not eligible for the Office 365 Move Program.  Eligibility is determined by tenant signup country.
- All of your core customer data at rest is already located in the new geo (see Data Location section of the page). 
  
If your organization has data residency requirements and you need to request migration, mark the checkbox and then **Save**.

You should see the text on the **Data residency** section change to indicate **Your organization has requested to move its data** to the appropriate country and date. You'll also have a confirmation message in your message center. This confirms that you have successfully requested a move. 


  
## What happens after requesting a move?

After requesting a move, we will plan to move you as quickly as our operational constraints allow. Due to the unpredictable nature of many of the constraints, we cannot share a specific date or timeframe for the moves. You will see a notification after the move has completed.
  
Moves may take up to 24 months from the request deadline for your country to complete.
  
## Microsoft Teams

As of January 2020, customers in eligible Office 365 countries can opt-in for migration of Microsoft Teams chat service data.  Opt-in timelines have been reopened or extended for all eligible countries to give customers an opportunity to consider the migration program with Microsoft Teams in scope. Customers that previously opted-in for a Data Residency move will also have Teams move to their local datacenter geo.
