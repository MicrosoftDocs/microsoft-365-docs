# Microsoft 365 inter-tenant collaboration

Suppose that two organizations, Fabrikam and Contoso, each have a Microsoft 365 for business tenant and they want to work together on several projects; some of which run for a limited time and some of which are ongoing. How can Fabrikam and Contoso enable their people and teams to collaborate more effectively across their different Microsoft 365 tenants in a secure manner? Microsoft 365, in conjunction with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B collaboration, provides several options. This article describes several key scenarios that Fabrikam and Contoso can consider.

Microsoft 365 inter-tenant collaboration options include using a central location for files and conversations, sharing calendars, using IM, audio/video calls for communication, and securing access to resources and applications. Use the following tables to select solutions and learn more.

## Points to be aware of about Microsoft 365 inter-tenant collaboration

### Sharing of user accounts, licenses, subscriptions, and storage

Each organization maintains its own user accounts, identities, security groups, subscriptions, licenses, and storage. People use the collaboration features in Microsoft 365 together with sharing policies and security settings to provide access to needed information while maintaining control of company assets.

- **User accounts:** Accounts cannot be shared or duplicated between the tenants or partitions in the on-premises Active Directory Domain Services.

- **Licenses &amp; subscriptions:** In Microsoft 365, licenses from licensing plans (also called SKUs or Microsoft 365 plans) give users access to the Microsoft 365 services that are defined for those plans.

- **Storage:** In Microsoft 365 licensing plans, software boundaries and limits for SharePoint Online are managed separately from mailbox storage limits. Mailbox storage limits are set up and managed by using Exchange Online. In both scenarios, storage can't be shared across tenants.

### Can we share domain namespaces across Microsoft 365 tenants?

No. Organization domain names, such as fabrikam.com or tailspintoys.com, can only be associated and used with a single Microsoft 365 tenant. Each tenant must have its own namespace. UPN, SMTP, and SIP namespaces cannot be shared across tenants.

### What about hybrid components and Microsoft 365 inter-tenant collaboration?

On-premises hybrid components, such as an Exchange organization and Azure AD Connect, cannot be split across multiple tenants.
