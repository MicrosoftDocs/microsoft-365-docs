# Step 6: Start a OneDrive cross-tenant migration

This is Step 6 in a solution designed to complete a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration. To learn more, see [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration overview](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration.md).

- Step 1: [Connect to the source and the target tenants](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step1.md)
- Step 2: [Establish trust between the source and the target tenant](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step2.md) 
- Step 3: [Verify trust has been established](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step3.md) 
- Step 4: [Pre-create users and groups](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step4.md)  
- Step 5: [Prepare identity mapping](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step5.md)
- **Step 6: [Start a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step6.md)**
- Step 7: [Post migration steps](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step7.md)

Now you're ready to start your OneDrive migration.  Before starting any cross-tenant migration, do the following steps. 

1. Ensure you've verified the compatibility status. if you see a compatible status on your source tenant you may continue. Run:

```powershell
Get-SPOCrossTenantCompatibilityStatus –PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Target tenant hostname]
```

2. To start the migration, a SharePoint Online Admin or Microsoft 365 Global Admin of the source tenant must run the following command:

```PowerShell
Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove  -SourceUserPrincipalName <…> -TargetUserPrincipalName <…> -TargetCrossTenantHostUrl <…>
```

|Parameters|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|SourceUserPrincipalName|User principal name of the user who owns the OneDrive on the Source tenant.|
|TargetUserPrincipalName|User principal name of the user who owns the OneDrive on the Target tenant.|
|TargetCrossTenantHostUrl|The Cross-tenant Host URL of the target tenant. To find the TargetCrossTenantHostUrl, run *Get-SPOCrossTenantHostUrl* on the tenant.|

Example:

```Powershell

Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove -SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com -TargetUserPrincipalName
        Test-Diego@M365x946316.OnMicrosoft.com -TargetCrossTenantHostUrl https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com/ 

```

To Schedule a migration for a later time, you may use and append the above command with the one of the following parameters. 

These commands can be useful when planning bulk batches of OneDrive migrations.  You can queue/migrate up to 4,000 OneDrive migrations per batch.  If your user count exceeds 4,000, create separate batches, and schedule them to run once the current batch is close to completion.

|Parameter|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|PreferredMoveBeginDate|The migration will likely begin at this specified time. Time must be specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).|
|PreferredMoveEndDate|The migration will likely be completed by this specified time, on a best effort basis. Time must be specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).|


## OneDrive status pre-migration

Before starting the migration, the users current source OneDrive status will be similar to the example below.  This example is from the users source tenant, showing their current files and folders.

## Cancelling a OneDrive migration

You can stop the cross-tenant migration of a user's OneDrive by using the following command, provided the migration doesn't have a status of *In Progress*, *Rescheduled* or *Success*.

```powershell

Stop-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove – SourceUserPrincipalName [UPN name of user who you wish to stop]

Stop-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove – SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com
```

## Determining current status of a migration

After starting your migration, you can check its status using the following command on either the source OR target tenant:

**Source command format**
```powershell

Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Target URL]
```
Example:

```Powershell
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL  https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com/

```

**Target command:** 

```powershell

Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Source URL]
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL  https://m365x016551-my.sharepoint.com/
```

To find the status of a specific user's migration, use the *UserPrincipalName* parameter:

```powershell

Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL <PartnerCrossTenantHostURL> -SourceUserPrincipalName <UPN>
Get-SPOUserAndContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com -SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com
```

To get the status of the move based on a particular user’s UPN but with more information, use the *-Verbose* parameter.

Example:

```PowerShell

Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL https://ttesttenant-my.sharepoint.com -SourceUserPrincipalName User3@stesttenant.onmicrosoft.com -Verbose 

```


## Migration States


|Status|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|NotStarted|The migration hasn't yet started.|
|Scheduled|The migration is now in the queue and is scheduled to run when a slot becomes available.|
|ReadytoTrigger|The Migration is in its pre-flight stage and will start the Migration shortly.|
|InProgress|The migration is in progress in one of the following states: </br>- Validation </br>- Backup </br>- Restore </br>- Cleanup|
|Success|The Migration has completed successfully.|
|Rescheduled|The migration may not have completed and has been requeued for another pass.|
|Failed	|The migration failed to complete.|


 
## Post-migration status checks

**Target tenant:** 
After the migration has successfully completed, check the status of the user on the target tenant by logging into their new OneDrive account. 

**Source tenant:**
Since the user has successfully migrated to the target tenant, they no longer have an active OneDrive account on the source.
