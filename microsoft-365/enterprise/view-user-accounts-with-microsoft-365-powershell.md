# View Microsoft 365 user accounts with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

Although you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to view the accounts for your Microsoft 365 tenant, you can also use PowerShell for Microsoft 365 and do some things that the admin center cannot.
  
## Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module).
  
### View all accounts

To display the full list of user accounts, run this command:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser
```

You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
ObjectId                             DisplayName                                           UserPrincipalName
--------                             -----------                                           -----------------

```

### View a specific account

To display a specific user account, fill in the sign-in account name of the user account, also known as the user principal name (UPN), remove the "<" and ">" characters, and run this command:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectID <sign-in name of the user account>
```

Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectID BelindaN@litwareinc.onmicosoft.com
```

### View additional property values for a specific account

By default, the **Get-AzureADUser** cmdlet only displays the ObjectID, DisplayName, and UserPrincipalName properties of accounts.

To be more selective about the list of properties to display, you can use the **Select** cmdlet in combination with the **Get-AzureADUser** cmdlet. To combine the two cmdlets, we use the "pipe" character "|", which tells Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph to take the results of one command and send it to the next command. Here is an example command that displays the DisplayName, Department, and UsageLocation for every user account:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser | Select DisplayName,Department,UsageLocation
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
- Get all of the information on the user accounts ( **Get-AzureADUser** ) and send it to the next command ( **|** ).
    
- Display only the user account name, department, and usage location ( **Select DisplayName, Department, UsageLocation** ).
  
To see all of the properties for user accounts, use the **Select** cmdlet and the wildcard character (*) to display them all for a specific user account. Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectID BelindaN@litwareinc.onmicosoft.com | Select *
```

As another example, you can check the enabled status of a specific user account with the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectID <sign-in name of the user account> | Select DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,AccountEnabled
```

### View some accounts based on a common property

To be more selective about the list of accounts to display, you can use the **Where** cmdlet in combination with the **Get-AzureADUser** cmdlet. To combine the two cmdlets, we use the "pipe" character "|", which tells Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph to take the results of one command and send it to the next command. Here is an example command that displays only those user accounts that have an unspecified usage location:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.UsageLocation -eq $Null}
```

This command instructs Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph to:
  
- Get all of the information on the user accounts ( **Get-AzureADUser** ) and send it to the next command ( **|** ).
    
- Find all of the user accounts that have an unspecified usage location ( **Where {$\_.UsageLocation -eq $Null}** ). Inside the braces, the command instructs PowerShell to only find the set of accounts in which the UsageLocation user account property ( **$\_.UsageLocation** ) is not specified ( **-eq $Null** ).
    
The **UsageLocation** property is only one of many properties associated with a user account. To see all of the properties for user accounts, use the **Select** cmdlet and the wildcard character (*) to display them all for a specific user account. Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectID BelindaN@litwareinc.onmicosoft.com | Select *
```

For example, from this list, **City** is the name of a user account property. This means you can use the following command to list all of the user accounts for users living in London:
  
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.City -eq "London"}
```

> [!TIP]
>  The syntax for the **Where** cmdlet shown in these examples is **Where {$\_.** [user account property name] [comparison operator] [value] **}**.>  [comparison operator] is **-eq** for equals, **-ne** for not equals, **-lt** for less than, **-gt** for greater than, and others.  [value] is typically a string (a sequence of letters, numbers, and other characters), a numerical value, or **$Null** for unspecified>  See [Where](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Where?view=powershell-5.1) for more information.
  

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

### View all accounts

To display the full list of user accounts, run this command:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser
```

>[!Note]
>PowerShell Core does not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. To continue using these cmdlets, you must run them from Windows PowerShell.
>

You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
UserPrincipalName                     DisplayName           isLicensed
-----------------                     -----------           ----------
BonnieK@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com    Bonnie Kearney        True
FabriceC@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com   Fabrice Canel         True
BrianJ@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Brian Johnson         False 
AnneWlitwareinc.onmicrosoft.com       Anne Wallace          True
ScottW@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Scott Wallace         False
```

The **Get-MsolUser** cmdlet also has a set of parameters to filter the set of user accounts displayed. For example, for the list of unlicensed users (users who've been added to Microsoft 365 but haven't yet been licensed to use any of the services), run this command.
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -UnlicensedUsersOnly
```

You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
UserPrincipalName                     DisplayName           isLicensed
-----------------                     -----------           ----------
BrianJ@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Brian Johnson         False
ScottW@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Scott Wallace         False
```

For more information about additional parameters to filter the display the set of user accounts displayed, see [Get-MsolUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/dn194133(v=azure.100)).
  
### View a specific account

To display a specific user account, fill in the sign-in name of the user account of the user account, also known as the user principal name (UPN), remove the "<" and ">" characters, and run this command:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <sign-in name of the user account>
```

### View some accounts based on a common property

To be more selective about the list of accounts to display, you can use the **Where** cmdlet in combination with the **Get-MsolUser** cmdlet. To combine the two cmdlets, we use the "pipe" character "|", which tells PowerShell to take the results of one command and send it to the next command. Here is an example command that displays only those user accounts that have an unspecified usage location:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser | Where {$_.UsageLocation -eq $Null}
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
- Get all of the information on the user accounts ( **Get-MsolUser** ) and send it to the next command ( **|** ).
    
- Find all of the user accounts that have an unspecified usage location ( **Where {$\_.UsageLocation -eq $Null}** ). Inside the braces, the command instructs PowerShell to only find the set of accounts in which the UsageLocation user account property ( **$\_.UsageLocation** ) is not specified ( **-eq $Null** ).
    
You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
UserPrincipalName                     DisplayName           isLicensed
-----------------                     -----------           ----------
BrianJ@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Brian Johnson         False 
ScottW@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com     Scott Wallace         False

```

The **UsageLocation** property is only one of many properties associated with a user account. To see all of the properties for user accounts, use the **Select** cmdlet and the wildcard character (*) to display them all for a specific user account. Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName BelindaN@litwareinc.onmicosoft.com | Select *
```

For example, from this list, **City** is the name of a user account property. This means you can use the following command to list all of the user accounts for users living in London:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser | Where {$_.City -eq "London"}
```

> [!TIP]

[comparison operator] is **-eq** for equals, **-ne** for not equals, **-lt** for less than, **-gt** for greater than, and others.  [value] is typically a string (a sequence of letters, numbers, and other characters), a numerical value, or **$Null** for unspecified. See [Where](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh849715.aspx) for more information.
  
You can check the blocked status of a user account with the following command:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN of user account> | Select DisplayName,BlockCredential
```

### View additional property values for accounts

The **Get-MsolUser** cmdlet by default displays three properties of user accounts:
  
- UserPrincipalName
    
- DisplayName
    
- isLicensed
    
If you need additional properties, such as the department the user works for and the country/region where the user uses Microsoft 365 services, you can run **Get-MsolUser** in combination with the **Select** cmdlet to specify the list of user account properties. Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser | Select DisplayName, Department, UsageLocation
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
- Get all of the information on the user accounts ( **Get-MsolUser** ) and send it to the next command ( **|** ).
    
- Display only the user account name, department, and usage location ( **Select DisplayName, Department, UsageLocation** ).
    
You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
DisplayName             Department                       UsageLocation
-----------             ----------                       -------------
Bonnie Kearney          Sales & Marketing                    US
Fabrice Canel           Legal                                US
Brian Johnson
Anne Wallace            Executive Management                 US
Alex Darrow             Sales & Marketing                    US
Scott Wallace           Operations
```

The **Select** cmdlet lets you pick and choose the properties you want a command to display. To see all of the properties for user accounts, use the wildcard character (*) to display them all for a specific user account. Here is an example:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName BelindaN@litwareinc.onmicosoft.com | Select *
```

To be more selective about the list of accounts to display, you can also use the **Where** cmdlet. Here is an example command that displays only those user accounts that have an unspecified usage location:
  
```powershell
Get-MsolUser | Where {$_.UsageLocation -eq $Null} | Select DisplayName, Department, UsageLocation
```

This command instructs PowerShell to:
  
- Get all of the information on the user accounts ( **Get-MsolUser** ) and send it to the next command ( **|** ).
    
- Find all of the user accounts that have an unspecified usage location ( **Where {$\_.UsageLocation -eq $Null}** ) and send the resulting information to the next command ( **|** ). Inside the braces, the command is instructing PowerShell to only find the set of accounts in which the UsageLocation user account property ( **$\_.UsageLocation** ) is not specified ( **-eq $Null** ).
    
- Display only the user account name, department, and usage location ( **Select DisplayName, Department, UsageLocation** ).
    
You should see information similar to this:
  
```powershell
DisplayName              Department                      UsageLocation
-----------              ----------                      -------------
Brian Johnson 
Scott Wallace            Operations
```

If you are using directory synchronization to create and manage your Microsoft 365 users, you can display which local account a Microsoft 365 user has been projected from. The following assumes that Azure AD Connect has been configured to use the default source anchor of ObjectGUID (for more on configuring a source anchor, see [Azure AD Connect: Design concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-connect-design-concepts)) and assumes that the Active Directory Domain Services module for PowerShell has been installed (see [RSAT tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=45520)):

```powershell
Get-ADUser ([guid][System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN of user account>).ImmutableID)).guid
```
