Contoso has three tiers of offices:

- Headquarters

  Contoso headquarters is a corporate campus on the outskirts of Paris with dozens of buildings for administrative, engineering, and manufacturing facilities. All the Contoso datacenters and its internet presence are housed in the Paris headquarters.

  The headquarters has 25,000 workers.

- Regional hubs

  Hub offices serve a specific region of the world with 60-percent sales and support staff. Each regional hub is connected to the Paris headquarters through a high-bandwidth WAN link.

  The regional hubs have an average of 2,000 workers.

- Satellite offices

  Satellite offices contain 80-percent sales and support staff. They provide an on-site presence for Contoso customers in key cities or subregions. Each satellite office is connected to a regional hub through a high-bandwidth WAN link.

  The satellite offices have an average of 250 workers.

About 25 percent of the Contoso workforce is mobile-only. The regional hubs and satellite offices have a higher percentage of these workers. Providing better support for mobile-only workers is an important business goal for Contoso.
