# Microsoft 365 connectivity test in the Microsoft 365 admin center (preview)

The Microsoft 365 connectivity test is located at <https://connectivity.office.com>. It is an adjunct tool to the network insights and network score information available in the Microsoft 365 admin center under the **Health | Network Performance** menu.

>[!NOTE]
>The onboarding tool supports tenants in WW Commercial and GCC Moderate but not GCC High, DoD, Germany or China.

The network insights in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center are based on in-product measurements for your Microsoft 365 tenant. In comparison, the network insights from the Microsoft 365 connectivity test are run locally in the tool. Testing that can be done in-product is limited and by running tests local to the user more data can be gathered resulting in deeper insights. Consider then that the network insights in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center will show that there is a networking problem for use of Microsoft 365 at a specific office location. The Microsoft 365 connectivity test can help to identify the root cause of that problem leading to a recommended network performance improvement action.

We recommend that these be used together where networking quality status can be assessed for each office location in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and more specifics can be found after deployment of testing based on the Microsoft 365 connectivity test.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Network insights, performance recommendations and assessments in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center is currently in preview status, and is only available for Microsoft 365 tenants that have been enrolled in the feature preview program.

## The advanced tests client application

There are two parts to the Microsoft 365 connectivity test. There is the web site <https://connectivity.office.com> and there is a downloadable Windows client application. The downloadable client runs advanced network connectivity tests and most of the tests require this to be run.

You can run the advanced client test from the web site, and it will populate results back into the web page as it runs.

## User office location

The user office location is detected from the users web browser. It is used to identify network distances to specific parts of the enterprise network perimeter.

The user office location is shown on the map view.

## Distance to the network egress location

We identify the network egress IP Address on the server side. Location databases are used to look up the approximate location for the network egress and determine the distance from that location to the office location. This is shown as a network insight if the distance is greater than 500 miles (800 kilometers).

The network egress location is shown on the map view and connected to the user office location indicating the network backhaul inside of the enterprise WAN.

The location looked up from the network egress IP Address may not be accurate and this would lead to a false result from this test. To validate if this error is occurring for a specific IP Address you can use publicly accessible network IP Address location web sites.

Implementing local and direct network egress from user office locations to the Internet is recommended for Microsoft 365 network connectivity. Improvements to local and direct egress are the best way to address this network insight.

## Exchange Online service front door

The in-use Exchange Online service front door is identified in the same way that Outlook does this and we measure the network TCP latency from the user office location to it. These are both shown and the in-use Exchange Online service front door is compared to the list of recommended optimal service front doors for the current location. This is shown as a network insight if a non-optimal Exchange Online service front door is in use.

Use of a non-optimal Exchange Online service front door could be caused by network backhaul before the corporate network egress in which case we recommend local and direct network egress. It could also be caused by use of a remote DNS Recursive Resolver server in which case we recommend aligning the DNS Recursive Resolver server with the network egress.

We calculate a potential improvement in TCP latency to the Exchange Online service front door. This is done by looking at the tested user office location network latency and subtracting the network latency from the current location to the closets Exchange Online service front door. The difference represents the potential opportunity for improvement.

## Comparison of performance of customers in the area

The network TCP latency of the user office location to the Exchange Online service front door is compared to other Microsoft 365 customers in the same metro area. A network insight is shown if 10% or more of customers in the same metro area have better performance.

This network insight is generated on the basis that all users in a city have access to the same telecommunications infrastructure and the same proximity to Internet circuits and Microsoft's network.

## In use default gateway

The in-use default gateway is the router that the test client has configured for routing TCP/IP network connections.

This is provided for information only and does not contribute to any network insight.

## In use DNS server(s)

This shows the DNS server configured on the client machine that ran the tests. It might be a DNS Recursive Resolver server however this is uncommon. It is more likely to be a DNS forwarder server which caches DNS results and forwards any uncached DNS requests to another DNS server.

This is provided for information only and does not contribute to any network insight.

## Identified DNS Recursive Resolver server

The in-use DNS Recursive Resolver is identified by making a specific DNS request and then asking the DNS Name Server for the IP Address that it received the same request from. This IP Address is the DNS Recursive Resolver and it will be looked up in IP Address location databases to find the location. The distance from the user office location to the DNS Recursive Resolver server location is then calculated. This is shown as a network insight if the distance is greater than 500 miles (800 kilometers).

The location looked up from the network egress IP Address may not be accurate and this would lead to a false result from this test. To validate if this error is occurring for a specific IP Address you can use publicly accessible network IP Address location web sites.

This network insight will specifically impact the selection of the Exchange Online service front door. To address this insight local and direct network egress should be a pre-requisite and then DNS Recursive Resolver should be located close to that network egress.

## DNS lookup of Exchange Online front end server and SharePoint Online front end server

These show the DNS record for the service front door for these two Microsoft 365 workloads. They are provided for information only and there is no associated network insight.

## Proxy server identification

We identify proxy server(s) configured on the local machine. We identify if any of these are configured in the network path for optimize category Microsoft 365 network traffic. We identify the distance from the user office location to the proxy servers. The distance is tested first by ICMP ping and if that fails we test with TCP ping and finally if that fails we look up the proxy server IP Address in an IP Address location database. We show a network insight if the proxy server is further than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away from the user office location.

## Media quality checks

This test installs and runs the Skype for Business network assessment tool and interprets the results. The tool can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53885](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53885).

These are UDP protocol tests as is used by Microsoft Teams audio and video call and conferencing functionality. We test for UDP packet loss, UDP network latency, UDP jitter, and UDP packet reorder. A network insight is shown if any of these are over the allowable range.

## TCP Connectivity tests

We test for HTTP connectivity from the user office location to all of the required Microsoft 365 network endpoints. These are published at [https://aka.ms/o365ip](https://aka.ms/o365ip). A network insight is shown for any required network endpoints which cannot be connected to.

Connectivity ay be blocked by a proxy server, a firewall, or another network security device on the enterprise network perimeter or in use as a cloud proxy.

## SSL interception tests

We test the SSL certificate at each required Microsoft 365 network endpoint that is in the optimize or allow category as defined at [https://aka.ms/o365ip](https://aka.ms/o365ip). If any tests do not find a Microsoft SSL certificate, then the encrypted network connected must have been intercepted by an intermediary network device. A network insight is shown on any intercepted encrypted network endpoints.

Where an SSL certificate is found that isn't provided by Microsoft, we show the FQDN for the test and the in-use SSL certificate owner. This SSL certificate owner may be a proxy server vendor, or it may be an enterprise self-signed certificate.

## Network path diagnostics

This section shows the results of an ICMP traceroute to the Exchange Online service front door, the SharePoint Online service front door, and the Microsoft Teams service front door. It is provided for information only and there is no associated network insight.

## FAQ

Here are answers to some of our frequently asked questions.

### Is this tool released and supported by Microsoft?

It is currently a proof of concept and we plan to provide updates regularly until we reach general availability release status with support from Microsoft. Please provide feedback to help us improve. We are planning to publish a more detailed Office 365 Network Onboarding guide as part of this tool which is customized for the organization by its test results.

### What is Microsoft 365 service front door?

The Microsoft 365 service front door is an entry point on Microsoft's global network where Office clients and services terminate their network connection. For an optimal network connection to Microsoft 365, it is recommended that your network connection is terminated into the closest Microsoft 365 front door in your city or metro.

Note: Microsoft 365 service front door has no direct relationship to the "Azure Front Door Service" product available in the Azure marketplace.

### What is an optimal Microsoft 365 service front door?

An optimal Microsoft 365 service front door is one that is closest to your network egress, generally in your city or metro area. Use the Microsoft 365 network performance tool to determine location of your in-use Microsoft 365 service front door and optimal service front door. If the tool determines your in-use front door is optimal, then you are optimally connecting into Microsoft's global network.

### What is an internet egress location?

The internet egress Location is the location where your network traffic exits your enterprise network and connects to the Internet. This is also identified as the location where you have a Network Address Translation (NAT) device and usually where you connect with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you see a long distance between your location and your internet egress Location, then this may identify a significant WAN backhaul.
