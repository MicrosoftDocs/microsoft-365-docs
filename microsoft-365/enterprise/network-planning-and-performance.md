# Network planning and performance tuning for Microsoft 365
Before you deploy for the first time or migrate to Microsoft 365, you can use the information in these articles to estimate the bandwidth you need and then to test and verify that you have enough bandwidth to deploy or migrate to Microsoft 365. For an overview, see: [Network and migration planning for Microsoft 365](network-and-migration-planning.md).
