# Connect to all Microsoft 365 services in a single PowerShell window

When you use PowerShell to manage Microsoft 365, you can have multiple PowerShell sessions open at the same time. You might have different PowerShell windows to manage user accounts, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 features (security), and Microsoft Purview compliance features.

This scenario isn't optimal for managing Microsoft 365, because you can't exchange data among those windows for cross-service management. This article describes how to use a single instance of PowerShell to manage Microsoft 365 accounts, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and features in Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Purview compliance.

>[!Note]
>This article currently only contains the commands to connect to the Worldwide (+GCC) cloud. Notes provide links to articles about connecting to the other Microsoft 365 clouds.

## Before you begin

Before you can manage all of Microsoft 365 from a single instance of PowerShell, consider the following prerequisites:

- The Microsoft 365 work or school account that you use must be a member of a Microsoft 365 admin role. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md). This is a requirement for PowerShell for Microsoft 365, but not necessarily for all other Microsoft 365 services.

- You can use the following 64-bit versions of Windows:
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10
  - Windows 8.1 or Windows 8
  - Windows Server 2019
  - Windows Server 2016
  - Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012
  - Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)*
  - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1*

    \* You need to install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.*x* and then Windows Management Framework 3.0 or 4.0. For more information, see [Windows Management Framework](/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/wmf/overview).

- You need to install the modules that are required for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Exchange Online, Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Purview compliance, SharePoint Online, and Teams:

  - [Azure Active Directory V2](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module)
  - [SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online)
  - [Teams PowerShell Module](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-overview)
  - [Install and maintain the Exchange Online PowerShell module](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2#install-and-maintain-the-exchange-online-powershell-module)
  - [Teams PowerShell Overview](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-overview)

- PowerShell must be configured to run signed scripts for Exchange Online, Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft Purview compliance. Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session (a PowerShell session that you **Run as administrator**).

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

## Connection steps when using just a password

Follow these steps to connect to all the services in a single PowerShell window when you're using just a password for sign-in.

1. Open Windows PowerShell.

2. Run this command and enter your Microsoft 365 work or school account credentials.

   ```powershell
   $credential = Get-Credential
   ```

3. Run this command to connect to Azure AD by using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD -Credential $credential
   ```

   Or if you're using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module, run this command.

   ```powershell
   Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > PowerShell Core doesn't support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with *Msol* in their name. You must run these cmdlets from PowerShell.

4. Run these commands to connect to SharePoint Online. Specify the organization name for your domain. For example, for "litwareinc\.onmicrosoft.com", the  organization name value is "litwareinc".

   ```powershell
   $orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
   Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
   Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $Credential
   ```

5. Run these commands to connect to Exchange Online.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
   Connect-ExchangeOnline -ShowProgress $true
   ```

   > [!Note]
   > To connect to Exchange Online for Microsoft 365 clouds other than Worldwide, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

6. Run these commands to connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell.

   ```powershell
   $acctName="<UPN of the account, such as belindan@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
   Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName $acctName
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > To connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell for Microsoft 365 clouds other than Worldwide, see [Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

7. Run these commands to connect to Teams PowerShell.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
   $credential = Get-Credential
   Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $credential
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Skype for Business Online Connector is currently part of the latest Teams PowerShell module. If you're using the latest Teams PowerShell public release, you don't need to install the Skype for Business Online Connector.
   >
   > To connect to Microsoft Teams clouds other than *Worldwide*, see [Connect-MicrosoftTeams](/powershell/module/teams/connect-microsoftteams).
