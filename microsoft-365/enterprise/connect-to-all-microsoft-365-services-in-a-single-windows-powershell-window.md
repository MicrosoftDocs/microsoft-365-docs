# Connect to all Microsoft 365 services in a single PowerShell window

When you use PowerShell to manage Microsoft 365, it is possible to have multiple PowerShell sessions open at the same time in different PowerShell windows corresponding to managing user accounts, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, Skype for Business Online, Microsoft Teams, and the Security &amp; Compliance Center. 
  
This is not optimal for managing Microsoft 365 because you can't exchange data among those windows for cross-service management. This topic describes how to use a single instance of PowerShell from which you can manage Microsoft 365 accounts, Skype for Business Online, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and the Security &amp; Compliance Center.

>[!Note]
>This article currently only contains the commands to connect to the Worldwide (+GCC) cloud. Notes provide links to articles with information about connecting to the other Microsoft 365 clouds.

## Before you begin

Before you can manage all of Microsoft 365 from a single instance of PowerShell, consider the following prerequisites:
  
- The Microsoft 365 work or school account that you use for these procedures needs to be a member of a Microsoft 365 admin role. For more information, see [About admin roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide). This a requirement for PowerShell for Microsoft 365, not necessarily for all other Microsoft 365 services.
    
- You can use the following 64-bit versions of Windows:
    
  - Windows 10
    
  - Windows 8.1 or Windows 8
    
  - Windows Server 2019
    
  - Windows Server 2016
    
  - Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012
    
  - Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)*
    
  - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1*
    
    \* You need to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.*x* and then either the Windows Management Framework 3.0 or the Windows Management Framework 4.0. For more information, see [Installing the .NET Framework](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=257868) and [Windows Management Framework 3.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272757) or [Windows Management Framework 4.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391344).
    
    You need to use a 64-bit version of Windows because of the requirements for the Skype for Business Online module and one of the Microsoft 365 modules.
    
- You need to install the modules that are required for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Skype for Business Online and Teams:
    
   - [Azure Active Directory V2](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module)
   - [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251)
   - [Skype for Business Online, PowerShell Module](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532439)
   - [Exchange Online PowerShell V2](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/exchange-online-powershell-v2/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#install-and-maintain-the-exchange-online-powershell-v2-module)
   - [Teams PowerShell Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-overview)
    
-  PowerShell needs to be configured to run signed scripts for Skype for Business Online and the Security &amp; Compliance Center. To do this, run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session (a PowerShell window you open by selecting **Run as administrator**).
    
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

## Connection steps when using just a password

Here are the steps to connect to all the services in a single PowerShell window when you are using just a password for sign-in.
  
1. Open Windows PowerShell.
    
2. Run this command and enter your Microsoft 365 work or school account credentials.
    
   ```powershell
   $credential = Get-Credential
   ```

3. Run this command to connect to Azure AD using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module.
    
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD -Credential $credential
   ```
  
   Alternately, if you are using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell module, run this command.
      
   ```powershell
   Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
   ```

   > [!Note]
   > PowerShell Core does not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. To continue using these cmdlets, you must run them from PowerShell.

4. Run these commands to connect to SharePoint Online. Specify the organization name for your domain. For example, for "litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com", the  organization name value is "litwareinc".
    
   ```powershell
   $orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
   Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $userCredential
   ```

5. Run these commands to connect to Skype for Business Online. A warning about increasing the `WSMan NetworkDelayms` value is expected the first time you connect and should be ignored.
     
   ```powershell
   Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
   $sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
   Import-PSSession $sfboSession
   ```

6. Run this command to connect to Exchange Online.
    
   ```powershell
   Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $credential -ShowProgress $true
   ```

   > [!Note]
   > To connect to Exchange Online for Microsoft 365 clouds other than Worldwide, use the **-ExchangeEnvironmentName** parameter. See [Connect-ExchangeOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/powershell-v2-module/connect-exchangeonline?view=exchange-ps) for more information.

7. Run these commands to connect to Teams PowerShell.
    
   ```powershell
   Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
   Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $credential
   ```
  
   > [!Note]
   > To connect to Microsoft Teams clouds other than Worldwide, see [Connect-MicrosoftTeams](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/connect-microsoftteams?view=teams-ps).

8. Run these commands to connect to the Security &amp; Compliance Center.
    
   ```powershell
   $SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
   Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
   ```

   > [!Note]
   > To connect to the Security &amp; Compliance Center for Microsoft 365 clouds other than Worldwide, see [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell).

Here are all the commands in a single block when using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module. Specify the name of your domain host, and then run them all at one time.
  
```powershell
$orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $credential
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential
Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
$SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $credential -ShowProgress $true
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $credential
```

Alternately, here are all the commands in a single block when using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell module. Specify the name of your domain host, and then run them all at one time.
  
```powershell
$orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential
Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
$SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $credential -ShowProgress $true
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $credential
```

When you are ready to close down the PowerShell window, run this command to remove the active sessions to Skype for Business Online, SharePoint Online, the Security &amp; Compliance Center, and Teams:
  
```powershell
Remove-PSSession $sfboSession ; Remove-PSSession $SccSession ; Disconnect-SPOService ; Disconnect-MicrosoftTeams 
```

## Connection steps when using multi-factor authentication

Here are all the commands in a single block to connect to Azure AD, SharePoint Online, Skype for Business, Exchange Online, and Teams using multi-factor authentication in a single window using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module. Specify the user principal name (UPN) name of a user account and your domain host name, and then run them all at one time.

```powershell
$acctName="<UPN of the account, such as belindan@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
#Azure Active Directory
Connect-AzureAD
#SharePoint Online
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com
#Skype for Business Online
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -UserName $acctName
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
#Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName $acctName -ShowProgress $true
#Teams
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

Alternately, here are all the commands when using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell module.

```powershell
$acctName="<UPN of the account, such as belindan@litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$orgName="<for example, litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
#Azure Active Directory
Connect-MsolService
#SharePoint Online
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com
#Skype for Business Online
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -UserName $acctName
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
#Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName $acctName -ShowProgress $true
#Teams
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```
