## How to request migration

Eligible customers with service provisioned in Microsoft Cloud Germany will see a page in the Microsoft 365 admin center that will allow a customer tenant administrator to opt-in for migration.

To access the page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the navigation pane on the left, expand **Settings** and then click **Organization Profile**.

On the **Organization Profile** page, scroll down to the **Migrate from Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) to Office 365 services in the new German datacenter regions** section.

If your organization wishes to migrate your service from Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) to Office 365 services in the new German datacenter regions, click **Opt-in**.

Once an administrator has opted-in on behalf of your tenant then all administrators will see the confirmation in **Migrate from Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) to Office 365 services in the new German datacenter regions** section, including the date of opt-in. Administrators will also receive a confirmation in Message Center of the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## What happens after opting-in for migration?

Migrations are expected to take place in 2020 for organizations that opt-in to the Microsoft-driven approach.  As a result of the migration, core customer data and subscriptions are moved to the new German regions.  Microsoft will send updates throughout the migration process in Message Center.
