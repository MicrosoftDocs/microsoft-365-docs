# Password writeback for your Microsoft 365 test environment

*This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environments.*

Password writeback allows users to update their passwords through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which is then replicated to your local Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). With password writeback, users donâ€™t need to update their passwords through the on-premises AD DS where their original user accounts are stored. This helps roaming or remote users who do not have a remote access connection to their on-premises network.

This article describes how you can configure your Microsoft 365 test environment for password writeback.

There are two phases to setting this up:

1.	Create the Microsoft 365 simulated enterprise test environment with password hash synchronization.
2.	Enable password writeback for the TESTLAB AD DS domain.

## Phase 1: Configure password hash synchronization for your Microsoft 365 test environment

First, follow the instructions in [password hash synchronization](password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md). Here is your resulting configuration.

This configuration consists of: 
  
- Microsoft 365 E5 or Office 365 E5 trial or paid subscriptions.
- A simplified organization intranet connected to the Internet, consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual network. 
- Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize the TESTLAB AD DS domain to the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription.

## Phase 2: Enable password writeback for the TESTLAB AD DS domain

First, configure the User 1 account with the global administrator role.

1. From the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.microsoft.com), sign in with your global administrator account.

2. Click **Active users**.
 
3. On the **Active users** page, click the **user1** account,

4. On the **user1** pane, click **Edit** next to **Roles**.

5. On the **Edit user roles** pane for user1, click **Global administrator**. Click **Save**, and then click **Close**.

Next, configure the User 1 account with the security settings that allow it to change passwords on behalf of other users in the TESTLAB AD DS domain.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your global administrator account, and then connect to APP1 with the TESTLAB\User1 account.

2.  From the desktop of APP1, click **Start**, type **active**, and then click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

3. Click **View** in the menu bar. If **Advanced features** is not enabled, click it to enable it.

4. In the tree pane, right-click your domain, click **Properties**, and then click the **Security** tab.

5. Click **Advanced**.

6. On the **Permissions** tab, click **Add**.

7. Click **Select a principal**, type **User1**, and then click **OK**.

8. In **Applies to**, select **Descendant User objects**.

9. Under **Permissions**, select the following:

    - Change password
    - Reset password

10. Under **Properties**, select the following:
    - Write lockoutTime
    - Write pwdLastSet

11. Click **OK** three times to save the changes.

12. Close **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

Next, configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 for password writeback.

1. If needed, connect to APP1 with the TESTLAB\User1 account.

2. From the desktop of APP1, double-click **Azure AD Connect**.

3. On the **Welcome page**, click **Configure**.

4. On the **Additional tasks** page, click **Customize synchronization options**, and then click **Next**.

5. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, type your global administrator account credentials, and then click **Next**.

6. On the **Connect directories** and **Domain/OU filtering** pages, click **Next**.

7. On the **Optional features** page, select **Password writeback** and click **Next**. 

8. On the **Ready to configure** page, click **Configure** and wait for the process to finish.

9. When you see the configuration finish, click **Exit**.

You are now ready to test password writeback for users on computers that are not connected to the virtual network of your simulated intranet.

Here is your resulting configuration:

This configuration consists of:

- Microsoft 365 E5 or Office 365 E5 trial or paid subscriptions with the DNS domain TESTLAB.\<your domain name> registered.
- A simplified organization intranet connected to the Internet, consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual network. 
- Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize the list of accounts and groups from the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription to the TESTLAB AD DS domain. 
- Password writeback is enabled so that users can change their passwords through Azure AD without having to be connected to the simplified intranet.

See the [Simplify password updates](identity-add-user-accounts.md#identity-pw-writeback) step in the Identity phase for information and links to configure password writeback in production.
