## Overview of Data Residency

Microsoft 365 Cloud services run on our data centers around the world and provide services to customers around the world. Customer data might be stored in multiple data centers. Data residency refers to the geographic location where customer data is stored at rest. Data residency is important for government, public sector, education and regulated commercial entities to help ensure protection of personal and/or sensitive information. In many countries/regions, customers are expected to comply with laws, regulations or industry standards that explicitly govern the location of data storage.

Microsoft makes decisions on where to persistently store customer data based on two factors:

1. The _Default Geography_ of the _Tenant_
1. Available _Geographies_ for a given service

<a name='default-geography-of-the-aad-tenant'></a>

### _Default Geography_ of the Microsoft Entra ID _Tenant_

When a customer creates a new Microsoft Entra ID _Tenant_, the customer enters a country/region during the creation process. This country/region is what defines the _Default Geography_ for the _Tenant_. There are multiple paths to creating _Tenants_. They can be created through Microsoft Entra ID forms, they can be created when trying out new Microsoft 365 services (trials), etc. Once a _Tenant_ is created, the _Default Geography_ can't be changed.

### Available Geographies for a given service

Microsoft 365 services aren't deployed to all Microsoft data centers globally. The larger services, like Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams are universally deployed to all _Geographies_.  Other services make decisions on where to deploy their services based on the number of customers, regional affiliations, and software architectures. When a customer first uses a service in this category, the provisioning logic uses the _Default Geography_ and the supported _Geographies_ to determine where to provision a given customer.

Over time, a particular service may deploy their software to additional _Geographies_, so the provisioning locations for new customers can change over time. This doesn't necessarily cause customer data to move to a new _Geography_.

You can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to understand where your data for a given service is stored. As a _Tenant_ administrator you can find the actual data location by navigating to **Admin > Settings > Org Settings > Organization Profile > Data Location**. Currently the data location is available for Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, Exchange Online Protection, Viva Connections and Viva Topics. In addition to this resource, see the [Data Maps page](o365-data-locations.md).

Some examples:

**Example 1:** For a _Tenant_ with the sign-up country/region as "France" that has a new subscription that includes Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Teams, then the customer data for those services will be provisioned into the French _Local Region Geography_. Why? Because those services are deployed into the French data centers and the _Tenant_ has a France sign up country/region.

**Example 2:** For a _Tenant_ with the sign-up country/region as "Belgium" that has a new subscription that includes Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Teams, then the customer data for those services will be provisioned into the _Macro Region Geography 1 – EMEA_. Why? Because there are no Microsoft 365 data centers in Belgium and the closest Geography is _Macro Region Geography 1 - EMEA_.

**Example 3:** For a _Tenant_ with the sign-up country/region as "Japan" that has a new subscription that includes Microsoft Forms, then the customer data for Forms will be provisioned into the _Macro Region Geography 3 - Americas_. Why? Because Forms is only deployed in _Macro Region Geography 3 - Americas_ and _Macro Region Geography 1 – EMEA_ (EU _Tenants_ only).

**Example 4a:** For a _Tenant_ with the sign-up country/region as "Sweden" that has a new subscription that includes Microsoft Viva Engage, then the customer data for Viva Engage will be provisioned into the _Macro Region Geography 1 - EMEA_. Why? Because Viva Engage is deployed in _Macro Region Geography 1 - EMEA_ and Swedish _Tenants_ are best served out of that _Geography_.

**Example 4b:** For a _Tenant_ with the sign-up country/region as "Sweden" that has a subscription that includes Microsoft Viva Engage from before Viva Engage was deployed to _Macro Regional Geography 1 - EMEA_, then the customer data for Viva Engage will be located in _Macro Region Geography 3 - Americas_. Why? Because, at that time, Viva Engage only had a single deployment for all customers in _Macro Region Geography 3 - Americas_.

### Migrations/Moves

Once a Microsoft 365 service provisions a _Tenant_ into a particular _Geography_, there are three ways that this data could move to another _Geography_:

1. The Microsoft 365 service decides to move the data to a new _Geography_ for service operations reasons, if there are no other policies in place to prevent the move.
1. If a _Tenant_ subscribes to the _Multi-Geo_ service, then _Tenants_ user's data for Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 can be assigned to _Satellite Geographies_. 
1. If a _Tenant_ has sign up country/region as a _Local Region Geography_ and has a subscription to the _Advanced Data Residency_ service add-on, then the _Tenant_ data for the included services will be migrated from the _Regional Geography_ to the relevant _Local Region Geography_.

### Durable commitments on data location

There are three methods for ensuring that the _Tenant_ data location for a particular service doesn't change.

1. Product Terms: Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 provisioned in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, European Union and the United States have a commitment for customer data residency expressed in the [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all). For more information, see the [Product Terms Data Residency page](m365-dr-product-terms-dr.md).
1. _Multi Geo_ subscription: allows customers to assign data location for Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 to any supported _Geography_. For more information, see [Multi Geo Data Residency](microsoft-365-multi-geo.md).
1. _Advanced Data Residency_ subscription provides data residency commitments for an expanded set of Microsoft 365 services in any _Local Region Geography_. For more information, see the [Advanced Data Residency page](advanced-data-residency.md).

### FAQ

#### How does Microsoft define data?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Review our [definitions for different types of customer data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864390) on the Microsoft Trust Center. In the [Privacy & Security Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all), Microsoft makes contractual commitments regarding customer data/your _Tenant_ and user data. We refer to customer data as the customer data that is committed to be stored at rest only within a _Tenant's_ region according to the [Privacy & Security Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all).

</details>

#### Where are the exact addresses of the data centers?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Microsoft doesn't disclose the exact addresses of its data centers. We established this policy to help secure our data center facilities. However, we do list city locations. See Table 5 in the [Country/Region-specific Data Center City Locations](m365-dr-overview.md#countryregion-specific-data-center-city-locations) on the Overview and Definitions page to learn more.

</details>

#### Does the location of your customer data have a direct impact on your end users' experience?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

The performance of Microsoft 365 isn't simply proportional to a _Tenant_ user's distance to data center locations. Microsoft's continued investments in its global cloud network, global cloud infrastructure, and the Microsoft 365 services architecture help provide users with a singular, consistent experience independent of where customer data is stored at rest. If your users are experiencing performance issues, you should troubleshoot those in depth. Microsoft has published guidance for Microsoft 365 customers to plan for and optimize end-user performance on the [Office Support web site](network-planning-and-performance.md).

</details>

#### How does Microsoft help me comply with my national, regional, and industry-specific regulations?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

To help a _Tenant_ comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use of individuals' data, Microsoft 365 offers the most comprehensive set of compliance offerings of any global cloud productivity provider. Review [our compliance offerings](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home) and more details in the [Microsoft Purview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=862317) section on the Microsoft Trust Center. Also, certain Microsoft 365 plans offer further compliance solutions to help a _Tenant_ manage their data, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and monitor actions taken on their data.

</details>

#### Who can access your data and according to what rules?

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

 Microsoft implements strong measures to help protect a _Tenant's_ customer data from inappropriate access or use by unauthorized persons. This includes restricting access by Microsoft personnel and subcontractors, and carefully defining requirements for responding to government requests for customer data. However, you can access your _Tenant's_ customer data at any time and for any reason. More details are available on the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864392).

</details>

#### Does Microsoft access your data?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Microsoft automates most Microsoft 365 operations while intentionally limiting its own access to customer data. This helps us manage Microsoft 365 at scale and address the risks of internal threats to customer data. By default, Microsoft engineers have no standing administrative privileges and no standing access to customer data in Microsoft 365. A Microsoft engineer may have limited and logged access to customer data for a limited amount of time, but only when necessary for normal service operations and only when approved by a member of senior management at Microsoft (and, for customers who are licensed for the Customer Lockbox feature, by the customer).

</details>

#### How does Microsoft secure your data?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Microsoft has robust policies, controls, and systems built into Microsoft 365 to help keep your information safe. Review the [Microsoft 365 security section](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864393) on the Microsoft Trust Center to learn more.

</details>

#### Does Microsoft 365 encrypt your data?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Microsoft 365 uses service-side technologies that encrypt customer data at rest and in transit. For customer data at rest, Microsoft 365 uses volume-level and file-level encryption. For customer data in transit, Microsoft 365 uses multiple encryption technologies for communications between data centers and between clients and servers, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). Microsoft 365 also includes customer-managed encryption features.

</details>

#### Where can I find data residency information for Microsoft Azure?

<details><summary>Select to expand</summary>

Review the [Products available by region](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2093451) page to find data residency information for Microsoft Azure.

</details>

#### Why do I see my Microsoft 365 service requests for my data at rest connecting to servers in countries outside of my region?

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

On occasion, a customer request may be handled by servers in a different region than the location where a _Tenant's_ customer data is stored at rest. This may happen where network routing decisions choose a different server for the request processing, but in these cases such _Tenant's_ customer data is not moved to a new at rest location.
