# Deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise for your organization

Are you ready to deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise, integrate it with your on-premises infrastructure, and enable your employees to take advantage of cloud-based productivity and collaboration?

## Do-it-yourself guided deployment of Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise on your own requires that you perform detailed research to make the design decisions that streamline Microsoft 365 service configuration and user adoption. Start your planning [here](get-your-organization-ready-for-office-365.md).

To deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise on your own after completing your planning, these are the recommended steps.

1. [Set up your network](set-up-network-for-microsoft-365.md)

   Includes adding your Internet domains and optimizing the network performance for your on-premises users.

2. [Set up your identities](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md)

   Includes determining an identity model (cloud-only or hybrid), and for hybrid identity, setting up directory synchronization between your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and your Microsoft 365 subscription.

3. [Implement security](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365-whats-new)

   Includes configuring and rolling out basic and enhanced security, threat, and information protections for your tenant and identities in the first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond.
