# Step 1: Define security and information protection levels

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

![Phase 6: Information Protection](../media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/infoprotection_icon-small.png)

In this step, you'll define the levels of security and protection for your organization. For example, your sales department might only require a low security level. However, your research department and its highly valuable intellectual property might require a high security level that encrypts files and limits access to only research staff.

Although you can define your own security levels and might already have some in place, Microsoft recommends that you develop a plan to use at least three different levels of security and protection that can be applied. Here is a list to get you started: 

- **Baseline:** This is a minimum standard for protecting data and for the identities and devices that access your data. You can follow baseline security and protection recommendations to provide strong default protection that meets the needs of many organizations or their departments.
- **Sensitive:** This is additional protection for a subset of your data that must be protected beyond the baseline level. You can apply this increased protection to specific data sets in your Office 365 environment. Microsoft also recommends applying the sensitive security level to identities and devices that access sensitive data.
- **Highly regulated:** This is the highest level of protection for organizations that typically have a very small amount of data that is highly classified, considered intellectual property or trade secrets, or data that must adhere to strict security regulations. Microsoft 365 Enterprise has capabilities to help organizations meet these high security requirements, including equivalent protection for identities and devices.

For more information, see [Three tiers of protection](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md#three-tiers-of-protection).

As an interim checkpoint, see the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md#crit-infoprotect-step1) corresponding to this step.
