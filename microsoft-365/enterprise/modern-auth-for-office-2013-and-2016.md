description: Learn how Microsoft 365 modern authentication features work differently for Office 2013 and 2016 client apps.

# How modern authentication works for Office 2013, Office 2016, and Office 2019 client apps

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

Read this article to learn how Office 2013, Office 2016, and Office 2019 client apps use modern authentication features based on the authentication configuration on the Microsoft 365 tenant for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online.

> [!NOTE]
> Legacy client apps, such as Office 2010 and Office for Mac 2011, do not support modern authentication and can only be used with basic authentication.

## Availability of modern authentication for Microsoft 365 services

For the Microsoft 365 services, the default state of modern authentication is:

- Turned **on** for Exchange Online by default. See [Enable or disable modern authentication in Exchange Online](https://support.office.com/article/58018196-f918-49cd-8238-56f57f38d662) to turn it off or on.

- Turned **on** for SharePoint Online by default.

- Turned **on** for Skype for Business Online by default. See [Enable Skype for Business Online for modern authentication](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx)to turn it off or on.

> [!NOTE]
> For tenants created **before** August 1, 2017, modern authentication is turned **off** by default for Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online.

## Sign-in behavior of Office client apps

Office 2013 client apps support legacy authentication by default. Legacy means that they support either Microsoft Online Sign-in Assistant or basic authentication. In order for these clients to use modern authentication features, the Windows client must have registry keys set. For instructions, see [Enable Modern Authentication for Office 2013 on Windows devices](https://support.office.com/article/7dc1c01a-090f-4971-9677-f1b192d6c910).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of basic authentication is being deprecated for Exchange Online mailboxes on Microsoft 365. This means that if Outlook 2013 is not configured to use modern authentication, it loses the ability to connect. Read [this article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437) for more information about basic auth deprecation.

To enable modern authentication for any devices running Windows (for example on laptops and tablets), that have Microsoft Office 2013 installed, you need to set the following registry keys. The keys have to be set on each device that you want to enable for modern authentication:

|**Registry key**|**Type**|**Value** |
|:-------|:------:|--------:|
|HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\EnableADAL  |REG_DWORD  |1  |
|HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\Version |REG_DWORD |1 |
|HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover |REG_DWORD |1 |

Read [How to use Modern Authentication (ADAL) with Skype for Business](./hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md) to learn about how it works with Skype for Business.

## Software requirements

To enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for Office 2013 client apps, you must have the software listed below installed (at the version listed below, or a *later* version). The process is different depending on your installation type (either MSI-based, or via Click-to-run.)

First, find out if your Office installation is MSI-based or Click-to-run with the steps below.

1. Start Outlook 2013.
2. On the **File** menu, select **Office Account**.
3. For Outlook 2013 *Click-to-Run* installations an **Update Options** item is displayed. For MSI-based installations, the Update Options item is not displayed.
    1. The Click-to-run **Update Options** button will tell you 'Updates are automatically downloaded and installed', and your current version.

### Click-to-run based installations

For Click-to-run based installations you *must* have the following software installed at a file version listed below, or a *later* file version. If your file version is not equal to, or greater than, the file version listed, update it using the steps below.


|File name  |Install path on your computer  |File version  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|MSO.DLL     |C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\vfs\ProgramFilesCommonx86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE15\MSO.DLL       |15.0.4753.1001       |
|CSI.DLL   |CSI.DLL C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\csi.dll         |15.0.4753.1000        |
|Groove.EXE*     |C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\GROOVE.exe       |15.0.4763.1000      |
|Outlook.exe     |C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\OUTLOOK.exe         |15.0.4753.1002     |
|ADAL.DLL    |C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\vfs\ProgramFilesCommonx86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE15\ADAL.DLL       |1.0.2016.624         |
|Iexplore.exe    |C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer     |varies         |

\* If the Groove.EXE component is not present in your Office installation, it doesn't need to be installed for ADAL to work. However, if it is present, then the build for Groove.EXE listed here is required.

### MSI-based installations

For MSI-based installations the following software *must* be installed at the file version listed below, or a *later* file version. If your file version is not equal to, or greater than, the file version listed below, update using the link in the *Update KB Article* column.

\* If the Groove.EXE component is not present in your Office installation, it doesn't need to be installed for ADAL to work. However, if it is present, then the build for Groove.EXE listed here is required.

Office 2016 and Office 2019 clients support modern authentication by default, and no action is needed for the client to use these new flows. However, explicit action is needed to use legacy authentication.
