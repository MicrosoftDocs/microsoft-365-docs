- Your Microsoft 365 tenant

  Includes planning for your network connections to the Internet, your Microsoft 365 identities, and integration with apps, on-premises, Azure, and other elements. Go to [Subscriptions, licenses, accounts, and tenants for Microsoft's cloud offerings](subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings.md) for more information.

- Support for your clients

  Includes certificate-based authentication, mobile device management, authentication options, and inter-tenant collaboration. Go to [Certificate-based Authentication](microsoft-365-client-support-certificate-based-authentication.md) for more information.

- Support for hybrid modern authentication

  Includes planning for modern authentication when using hybrid configurations of key Microsoft 365 productivity apps. Go to [Hybrid modern authentication overview and prerequisites](hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md) for more information.

- Older Office clients and servers

  Includes migration information for Office 2007 and Office 2010 client and server products. Go to [Plan your upgrade](plan-upgrade-previous-versions-office.md) for more information.

You can also sign in to your Microsoft 365 subscription and use the [Setup guides for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services](setup-guides-for-microsoft-365.md).
