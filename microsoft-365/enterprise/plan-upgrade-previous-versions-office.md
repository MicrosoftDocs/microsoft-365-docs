# Plan your upgrade from Office 2007 or Office 2010 servers and clients

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

If your organization is using older versions of Office products and servers, this is a great time to start planning your upgrade. Office 2007 products and services have reached their [end of support](upgrade-from-office-2007-servers-and-products.md). 

- Office 2010 and Exchange 2010 will reach their end of support on **October 13, 2020**. 
- SharePoint 2010 and Project Server 2010 will reach their end of support on **April 13, 2021**. 

Use the resources in this article to get started.

See [Upgrade from Office 2010 servers and clients](upgrade-from-office-2010-servers-and-products.md) for more details.

## What is Microsoft 365?

[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) is the combination of innovative Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and world-class security that is designed to help you achieve more.

Microsoft 365 includes the licenses and capabilities to help ensure that your organization is working on the latest Windows operating system and that your devices—including Windows, iOS, and Android—are enrolled and kept secured with policies that require authentication and data protection. In addition, Windows 10 and your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (previously named Office 365 ProPlus) client software is updated on a continuing basis to include the latest features and security updates.
  
Microsoft 365 is the way to digitally transform your business with constantly-improving devices and productivity experiences, enabled and secured by the Microsoft cloud.

## What happens if I don't upgrade?

You can choose not to upgrade at this time. Your on-premises servers and applications will continue to run. However, when you no longer receive security updates or support options, you or your organization could be vulnerable to security breaches. We strongly recommend that you plan your upgrade as soon as possible, whether to Microsoft 365 or to newer versions of your on-premises servers and applications.

## What upgrade options are available?      

Organizations have several options to consider:

- **Upgrade your on-premises servers and applications.** If you're using Office products and server applications on premises, see the following planning content:<br/>

    |[PerformancePoint Server 2007](pps-2007-end-of-support.md) | |
 
- **Implement a hybrid solution with Microsoft 365 or Office 365.** Hybrid uses both your on-premises servers and applications and their cloud equivalents. If you are moving to the cloud in phases or you must keep some server and applications on premises, a hybrid solution might be right for your organization. See [Microsoft 365 hybrid cloud solutions overview](hybrid-cloud-overview.md) for the details. 
    
- **Move to the cloud with Microsoft 365 or Office 365.** For many customers, moving to the cloud is an efficient and cost-effective solution. By moving completely to the cloud, setup and ongoing management are easier and you seamlessly get all the latest features and security updates. See [What is Microsoft 365?](#what-is-microsoft-365) in this article for more information.
    
### Help is available for your organization

If you want help with planning your upgrade, consider one or more of the following options:

- Work with a partner or volume licensing specialist. [Find your Microsoft 365 partner or reseller](https://support.office.com/article/b6c18a9b-2aed-4c84-9d75-af709160258c.aspx). 

- If your organization purchases a certain number of Microsoft 365 licenses, our FastTrack team can help you through the setup process. To learn more, see [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365).

- If you're part of a smaller organization, or if you prefer to handle your organization's Office upgrade yourself, see [Upgrade your Microsoft 365 for business users to the latest Office client](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/upgrade-users-to-latest-office-client). 
  
## I'm a home user. What do I do?

If you're using Office 2007 or Office 2010 at home, consider the following update options:

- **Use Office in a browser for free.** Create, view, and edit Office files in your browser, and have access to those files from just about any device with internet access. [Office for the web](https://products.office.com/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online) includes [Word for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746664), [Excel for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746665), [PowerPoint for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746666), [OneNote for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746674), [Sway](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746675), [Email](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746676), [Calendar](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746678), and [OneDrive](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=746679). To get started, visit [office.com](https://office.com) and sign in using your [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account). (If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create one at [office.com](https://office.com).)

- **Try Microsoft 365 for home use.** Use [Microsoft 365 Family](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/p/microsoft-365-family/cfq7ttc0k5dm?rtc=2&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) for homes. Start a trial and see how Microsoft 365 Family works for you. With Microsoft 365 Family, you'll enjoy cloud storage with OneDrive.

   With the [end of support for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/end-of-windows-7-support), the versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher and Access provided with Office 365 Home or Office 365 Personal running on Windows 7 devices will receive security updates, but no feature updates. To continue receiving feature updates for these applications, [upgrade your Windows 7 devices to Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq).
    
- **Purchase Office Home &amp; Student.** If you choose this option, you'll make a one-time purchase and then install Office on your Windows PC or Mac. This isn't a subscription; it's a one-time, perpetual use license for one computer. View the [requirements](https://office.com/systemrequirements), and then choose the version you want to use.

    - If your Windows PC is running Windows 10, consider getting [Office Home & Student 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/p/office-home-student-2019/cfq7ttc0k7c8).

    - If your Windows PC is running Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 and you are not upgrading to Windows 10 at this time, consider getting Office Home & Student 2016 (or another edition of Microsoft Office) from an authorized reseller.
     
     - Support for Windows 7 is [ended on January 14, 2020](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/end-of-windows-7-support), after which Microsoft will not be providing security updates or support. Upgrade your Windows 7 devices to Windows 10 for continued security and feature updates and ongoing support.

You can also choose not to upgrade at this time. Your Office apps will continue to run. Timelines for Office support dates are available [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2085724). However, upgrading will give you security updates or new and improved features.
