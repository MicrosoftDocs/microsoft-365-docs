# Step 4: Configure increased security for Office 365

![This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise](./media/banners/Banner-Required-BothSKUs.png)

**Summary:** 

To ensure that your Office 365 subscription and its data start off and remain secure from malicious threats, you must configure the following additional security:

- Threat management policies in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center
- Additional Exchange Online tenant-wide settings
- Tenant-wide sharing policies in SharePoint admin center
- Settings in Azure Active Directory

Once configured, you can obtain information about your security posture from:

- Dashboards and reports in the Security & Compliance Center
- Office 365 Secure Score

For more information, see [Configure your Office 365 tenant for increased security](https://support.office.com/article/Configure-your-Office-365-tenant-for-increased-security-8d274fe3-db51-4107-ba64-865e7155b355).

You can also Cloud App Security or Office 365 Cloud App Security to monitor for security events and take action. For more information, see [Overview of Office 365 Cloud App Security](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-Office-365-Cloud-App-Security-81f0ee9a-9645-45ab-ba56-de9cbccab475).

## Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Office 365 ATP provides protection for safe links, safe attachments, spoof intelligence, and advanced anti-phishing capabilities for email in Exchange Online and files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams. Office 365 ATP enables your organization to collaborate more securely.

>[!Note]
>Office 365 ATP is only supported by Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5. If you have this version of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft requires its use to ensure that you protect yourself from malicious threats. If you have Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3, you cannot use Office 365 ATP and the required use of Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 is not meant to be implied.

For more information, see [Office 365 ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-ATP-for-SharePoint-OneDrive-and-Microsoft-Teams-26261670-db33-4c53-b125-af0662c34607).
