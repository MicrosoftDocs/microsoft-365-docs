# Step 3: Configure increased security for Office 365

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

To ensure that your Office 365 subscription and its data start off and remain secure from malicious threats, configure the following additional security for Office 365:

- [Tune threat management policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/tenant-wide-setup-for-increased-security#tune-threat-management-policies-in-the-office-365-security--compliance-center)
- [Additional Exchange Online tenant-wide settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/tenant-wide-setup-for-increased-security#configure-additional-exchange-online-tenant-wide-settings)
- [Tenant-wide sharing policies in the SharePoint admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/tenant-wide-setup-for-increased-security#configure-tenant-wide-sharing-policies-in-sharepoint-admin-center)
- [Settings in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/tenant-wide-setup-for-increased-security#configure-settings-in-azure-active-directory)

Once configured, you can obtain information about your security status from:

- [Dashboards and reports in the Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/tenant-wide-setup-for-increased-security#view-dashboards-and-reports-in-the-security--compliance-center)
- [Office 365 Secure Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-secure-score)

You can also use Cloud App Security or Office 365 Cloud App Security to monitor for security events and act. For more information, see [Overview of Office 365 Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-cas-overview).

An additional security feature is [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-atp), which helps your organization collaborate more securely by:

- Protecting [links](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/atp-safe-links) and [attachments](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/atp-safe-attachments) in email. 
- Providing spoof intelligence and anti-phishing capabilities for email in Exchange Online and [files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams).
