## Product Terms Data Residency Migration

When Microsoft's data centers were launched in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, Qatar, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or the United Arab Emirates, it was possible for any _Tenant_ with the appropriate _Default Geography_ to opt in to move their data into the applicable geography. This opt in period was open for six months after the Data Center was operational. Today, the _tenant_ must have a valid subscription to the Advanced Data Residency add-on in order to migrate data into the country data centers.
