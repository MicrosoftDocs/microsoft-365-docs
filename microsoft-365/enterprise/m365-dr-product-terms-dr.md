# Overview of Product Terms Data Residency

Microsoft Privacy and Security product terms included with Microsoft's Cloud product terms provides data residency commitment with the following scope:

1. Online Services: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams as of [need date].
2. Commitments period: The length of the customers contract with Microsoft. Typically, this is 1-3 years.
3. Country/regions included: Local Geographies, United States and the European Union.

The language at time of writing this article is:

- **Office 365 Services** If Customer provisions its tenant in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, Qatar, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, or the United States, Microsoft will store the following Customer Data at rest only within that Geo: (1) Exchange Online mailbox content (e-mail body, calendar entries, and the content of e-mail attachments), (2) SharePoint Online site content and the files stored within that site,  (3) files uploaded to OneDrive for Business, and (4) Microsoft Teams chat messages (including private messages, channel messages, meeting messages and images used in chats), and for customers using Microsoft Stream (on SharePoint), meeting recordings.

## Product Terms Data Residency Migration

When Microsoft's data centers were launched in _Local Region Geographies_, it was possible for any _Tenant_ with the appropriate _Default Geography_ to opt in to move their data into the _Local Region Geographies_. This opt in period was open for six months after the Data Center was operational.

Practically, this means that there are a number of tenants that didn't opt in to move and remain in the _Macro Region Geography_ data centers. On or about November 1, 2022 with the introduction of the Advanced Data Residency add-on, all tenants that remain in the _Macro Region Geography_ data centers will have another six month period to opt in for data migration to their _Local Region Geography_.  See the [Legacy Move Program page](m365-dr-legacy-move-program.md#how-to-request-your-data-move---final-opportunity) for more details.
