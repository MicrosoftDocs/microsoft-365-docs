# Migration phases actions and impacts for the migration from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland (advanced) 

Tenant migrations from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to the Germany region of Microsoft's Office 365 services are executed as a set of phases and their configured actions for each workload. This figure shows the nine phases of migration to the new German datacenters.

![The nine phases of migration to the new Germany datacenters](../media/ms-cloud-germany-migration-opt-in/migration-organization.png)

The following sections provide additional information on customer experiences when moving from Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) to Office 365 services in the new German datacenter region.

## Office 365 Portal Services

Between Phase 2 of 9 and Phase 3 of 9, Partner Portal may not be accessible. During this time, Partner may not be able to access the tenants information on the Partner Portal. Since each migration is different, the duration of in-accessibility could be in hours.

### Prework for Azure AD (Phase 2)

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| Azure AD tenant in Microsoft Cloud Deutschland copied to Office 365 Services. | Azure AD copies the tenant to Office 365 services. Tenant and user identifiers are preserved. Azure AD service calls are redirected from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 services and are transparent to services. | All Office customers | - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Data Subject Requests (DSRs) are executed from the Azure Admin portal for future requests. Any legacy or non-customer diagnostic data that is resident in Microsoft Cloud Deutschland is deleted at or before 30 days elapse. <br><br> - Customers who use federated authentications with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) shouldn't make changes to issuer URIs that are used for all authentications with on-premises Active Directory during migration. Changing issuer URIs will lead to authentication failures for users in the domain. Issuer URIs can be changed directly in AD FS or when a domain is converted from _managed_ to _federated_ and vice-versa. We recommend that customers do not add, remove, or convert a federated domain in the Azure AD tenant that has been migrated. Issuer URIs can be changed after the migration is fully complete. <br><br> - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests that use Microsoft Authenticator display as the user ObjectID (a GUID) while the tenant is copied to Office 365 services. MFA requests will perform as expected despite this display behavior.  Microsoft Authenticator accounts that were activated by using Office 365 services endpoints will display the user principal name (UPN).  Accounts added by using Microsoft Cloud Deutschland endpoints will display the user ObjectID but will work with both Microsoft Cloud Deutschland and Office 365 services endpoints.  |
| Migration of Azure resources. | Customers who use Office 365 and Azure resources (for example, networking, compute, and storage) will perform the migration of resources to the Office 365 services instance. This migration is a responsibility for customers. Message Center posts will signal the start. Migration must be completed before finalization of the Azure AD organization in the Office 365 services environment. | Azure Customers | For Azure migrations, see the Azure migration playbook, [Overview of migration guidance for Azure Germany](/azure/germany/germany-migration-main). |
|||||

### Exchange Online before phase 5

**Applies to:** All customers using an Exchange Hybrid Configuration with Exchange servers on premises

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Establish AuthServer on-premises pointing to global STS service. | This ensures that requests from users who migrate to Microsoft Cloud Deutschland for Exchange availability requests that target the hybrid on-premises environment are authenticated to access the on-premises service. Similarly this will ensure authentication of requests from on-premises to Office 365 services endpoints. | After Azure AD migration is complete, the administrator of the on-premises Exchange (hybrid) topology must add a new authentication service endpoint for the Office 365 services. With this command from Exchange PowerShell, replace `<TenantID>` with your organization's tenant ID (found in Azure portal on **Azure Active Directory**).<br><br>`New-AuthServer GlobalMicrosoftSts -AuthMetadataUrl https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/<TenantId>/metadata/json/1` <br> <br> Failing to complete this task may result in hybrid free-busy requests failing to provide information for mailbox users who have been migrated from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 services.  |
|Stop or delete any onboarding or offboarding mailbox moves, namely don't move mailboxes between Exchange on premises and Exchange Online  | This ensures the mailbox move requests don't fail with an error. | Failure to do so may result in failure of the service or of software clients. |

    Question from ckinder
    Not clear if this has to be done before, during or after phase 5
-->

**Applies to:** All customers storing user photos in Exchange Online and are  using **Set-UserPhoto**:

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| The new region "Germany" is added to an existing Exchange Online organization setup, and mailboxes are moved to Office 365 services. | Exchange Online configuration adds the new go-local German region to the transitioning organization. This Office 365 services region is set as default, which enables the internal load-balancing service to redistribute mailboxes to the appropriate default region in Office 365 services. In this transition, users on either side (Germany or Office 365 services) are in the same organization and can use either URL endpoint. | If a user mailbox has been migrated but an administrator mailbox hasn't been migrated, or vice-versa, administrators won't be able to run **Set-UserPhoto**, a PowerShell cmdlet. In this situation, an admin must pass an additional string in `ConnectionUri` during connection set up by using the following syntax: <br> `https://outlook.office.de/PowerShell-LiveID?email=<user_email>` <br> where `<user_email>` is the placeholder for the email-ID of the user whose photo needs to be changed by using **Set-UserPhoto**. |
||||

## During migration

### SharePoint Online phase 4

**Applies to:** All customers using eDiscovery

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| SharePoint and OneDrive are transitioned. | SharePoint and OneDrive are migrated from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 Global services in phase 4. Existing Microsoft Cloud Deutschland URLs are preserved (`contoso.sharepoint.de`). Tokens issued by Microsoft Cloud Deutschland or Office 365 services are valid during the transition. | Inflight SharePoint 2013 workflows will be broken during migration and must be republished after migration. |
||||

### eDiscovery phase 4 to the end of phase 9

**Applies to:** All customers using eDiscovery

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| From the beginning of phase 4 until phase 9 is completed, eDiscovery searches will fail or return 0 results for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange Online locations that have been migrated. | During migration, customers can continue to create cases, holds, searches, and exports in the [Security & Compliance Center](../compliance/manage-legal-investigations.md), including [Content Search](../compliance/search-for-content.md).  However, searches against SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange Online locations that have been migrated will either return 0 results or produce an error. For remediation, see the _Impact_ column. | In the event that a search returns zero results or an error during migration, please take the following action for SharePoint Online: <ul><li>Download sites directly from SharePoint Online/ OneDrive for Business site by following the instructions in [Download files and folders from OneDrive or SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/download-files-and-folders-from-onedrive-or-sharepoint-5c7397b7-19c7-4893-84fe-d02e8fa5df05). This method will require SharePoint Online administrator permissions or read-only permissions on the site.</li><li>If limits are exceeded, as explained in [Download files and folders from OneDrive or SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/download-files-and-folders-from-onedrive-or-sharepoint-5c7397b7-19c7-4893-84fe-d02e8fa5df05), customers can use the OneDrive for Business sync client by following the guidance in [Sync SharePoint and Teams files with your computer](https://support.office.com/article/sync-sharepoint-files-with-the-new-onedrive-sync-app-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88).</li><li>For more information see  [In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Server](/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/ediscovery/ediscovery) |
||||

## Post-migration

### Azure AD phase 9

**Applies to:** All customers synchronizing identities with Azure AD connect

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Update Azure AD Connect. | After the cut over to Azure AD is complete, the organization is fully using Office 365 services and is no longer connected to Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. At this point, the customer needs to ensure that the delta sync process has been finalized, and after that, change the string value of `AzureInstance` from 3 (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) to 0 in the registry path `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect`. | Change the value of `AzureInstance`, the registry key. Failing to do so, will lead to objects not being synchronized after the Microsoft Cloud Deutschland endpoints are no longer available. |
|||||

**Applies to:** All customers using federated authentication with ADFS

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Remove relying party trusts from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland AD FS. | After the cut over to Azure AD is complete, the organization is fully using Office 365 services and is no longer connected to Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. At this point, the customer needs to remove the relying party trust to the Microsoft Cloud Deutschland endpoints. This can only be done when no applications of the customer point to Microsoft Cloud Deutschland endpoints when Azure AD is leveraged as an Identity Provider (IdP). | Federated Authentication organizations | None. |
|||||

<!--
    Question from ckinder
    The following paragraph is not clear
-->
For Azure AD:

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| Requests to join an Azure AD group in the last 30 days before migration will need to be requested again if the original request wasn't approved. | End-user customers will need to use the Access panel to submit request to join an Azure AD group again if those requests weren't approved in the last 30 days before the migration. | End users whose Azure AD group approval requests weren't approved in last 30 days before migration |  As an end user: <ol><li>Navigate to [Access panel](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/joinGroups).</li><li>Find an Azure AD group for which membership approval was pending in 30 days before migration.</li><li>Request to join the Azure AD group again.</li></ol> Requests to join a group that are active less than 30 days before migration cannot be approved, unless they're re-requested after migration. |
|||||

<!--
    Question from ckinder
    The following paragraph is not clear
-->
**Applies to:**  All customer managing their own DNS zones

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| Update on-premises DNS services for Office 365 services endpoints. | Customer-managed DNS entries that point to Microsoft Cloud Deutschland need to be updated to point to the Office 365 Global services endpoints. | Failure to do so may result in failure of the service or of software clients. |
||||

For third-party services for Office 365 services endpoints:

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Update partners and third-party services for Office 365 services endpoints. | <ul><li>Third-party services and partners that point to Office 365 Germany need to be updated to point to the Office 365 services endpoints. Example: Re-register, in alignment with your vendors and partners, the gallery app version of applications, if available. </li><li>Point all custom applications that leverage Graph API from `graph.microsoft.de` to `graph.microsoft.com`. Other APIs with changed endpoints also need to be updated, if leveraged. </li><li>Change all non-first-party enterprise applications to redirect to the worldwide endpoints. </li></ul>| Required action. Failure to do so may result in failure of the service or of software clients. |
||||

### SharePoint Online post migration

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| Republish SharePoint 2013 workflows. | In the pre-migration work, we reduced the number of SharePoint 2013 workflows. Now with migration complete, the customer can republish the workflows. | This is a required action. Failure to do so may result in user confusion and help desk calls. |
| Share items via Outlook | Sharing items in  SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business via Outlook no longer works after tenant cutover. |<ul><li>In SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, you can share items via Outlook. After pressing the Outlook button, a shareable link is created and pushed into a new message in the Outlook Web App.</li><li>After tenant cutover, this method of sharing won't work. We recognize this is a known issue. However, since this Outlook feature is in the path of deprecation, fixing the issue is not planned until the deprecation is rolled out. </li></ul>|
||||

### Exchange Online post migration

If you're using a hybrid Exchange configuration:

| Step(s) | Description | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| Rerun Hybrid Configuration wizard (HCW) against Office 365 services. | The existing HCW configuration is meant to support Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. With migration of Exchange services complete, we decouple on-premises configuration from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. |<ul><li>Required action. Failure to do so may result in failure of the service or of software clients. Before Exchange mailbox migration begins (with 5 or more days of notice), notify clients that they should stop and delete any onboarding or offboarding moves of their mailboxes.  If they don't, they'll see errors in their move requests. </li><li>After Exchange mailbox migration is complete, notify clients that they can resume onboarding and offboarding moves. <br> Running **Test-MigrationServerAvailabiilty**, a PowerShell cmdlet, during migration of Exchange from Microsoft Cloud Deutschland to Office 365 services might not work. However, it will work properly after migration is complete. </li><li>If clients run into issues with credentials or authorization after mailboxes are migrated, users can reenter their on-premises administrator credentials in the migration endpoint by running `Set-MigrationEndpoint endpointName -Credential $(Get-Credential)`, or by setting the same by using Exchange Control Panel (ECP). </li></ul>|

### eDiscovery post migration

| Step(s) | Description | Applies to | Impact |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
|  All SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange Online locations have been migrated along with Security and Compliance Center (SCC). | All eDiscovery activity should be run from the worldwide tenant. Searches will now be 100% successful.  Any failures or errors should follow normal support channels. | All customers who use eDiscovery | None. |
| Remove organization-wide retention policies that were created during pre-migration steps | Customers can remove the organization-wide retention policies that were created during the customers' pre-migration work. | All customers who applied a retention policy as part of pre-migration steps. | None. |
