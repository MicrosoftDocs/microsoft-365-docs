# Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program

Network connectivity has a direct impact on your users’ ability to work quickly, collaborate effectively, and streamline business processes with Microsoft 365. For customers in any stage of their digital transformation, network design is a critical aspect that should be proactively addressed before issues negatively impact user experience.

As customers adopt Microsoft 365 for business productivity, Microsoft has observed a common trend that network performance and the resulting end-user collaboration experience is directly influenced by network solutions in the path between the user and Microsoft 365. To help partners design optimal network solutions and help customers make informed decisions regarding such solutions, we built the Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program.

The Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program deepens our collaboration with network partners and identifies key products and solutions that follow Microsoft 365 networking requirements, recommendations, and best practices. The goal of the Microsoft 365 Networking Partner program is to facilitate customer ability to improve their Microsoft 365 experience through easy discovery of validated partner solutions that consistently demonstrate alignment to key principles for optimal Microsoft 365 connectivity in customer deployments.

To modernize enterprise networks for great connectivity to Microsoft 365, customers often rely on network solution providers, on-premises or cloud-based security services, and system integrators to plan, design, and implement network connectivity for cloud services. Customers often ask Microsoft whether their network architecture and solutions work with Microsoft 365 and whether they align with Microsoft’s [Network Connectivity Principles for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/PNC).

The Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program helps answer these questions and demonstrates Microsoft’s commitment to help our customers build and optimize their network architecture for the best Microsoft 365 experience. The Microsoft 365 team is working with many network industry partners to help ensure that the key principles for optimal connectivity are natively built into their network product and solutions.

The Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program designates qualified networking solutions as “Works with Microsoft 365”. Only devices or solutions that meet Microsoft’s rigorous testing requirements, have seamless experiences with setup, and demonstrate a high-quality networking experience when used with Microsoft 365 will receive the “Works with Microsoft 365” designation. These validated partner solutions are listed on the [Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program page](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/O365networkingpartners), along with solution details and links to learn more.

If you are a Microsoft 365 customer, you can make your network solution provider aware of this program through this page at [https://aka.ms/Office365NPP](https://aka.ms/Office365NPP).
