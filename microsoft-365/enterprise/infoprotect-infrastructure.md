# Phase 6: Information protection

![Phase 6: Information protection](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/infoprotection_icon.png)

Information protection is a set of policies and technologies that define how you transmit, store, and process sensitive information. In Phase 6, you step through information protection settings and features of Microsoft 365 Enterprise that help you secure data for your cloud-based workloads and scenarios.

>[!Note]
>If you already have already deployed information protection, please see the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise information protection infrastructure 

Itâ€™s important to work with your legal and compliance teams to determine if your organization needs to meet compliance standards such as HIPPA, CJIS, or GDPR. You should also work with your security group to determine the objectives for information protection for your organization and for departments or groups that require additional security.

Next, use the following steps to build out information protection for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
