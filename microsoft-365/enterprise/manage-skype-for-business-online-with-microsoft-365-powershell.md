# Manage Skype for Business Online with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

One of the primary tasks of any Skype for Business Online administrator is managing policies. Although you can accomplish some of these tasks in the Microsoft 365 admin center, other tasks are much quicker and easier in PowerShell. 

## Before you start

Download and install the [Skype for Business Online Connector module](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39366), and then restart your computer.


## Connect using a Skype for Business Online administrator account name and password

1. Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt and run the following commands: 
    
   ```powershell
   Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
   $userCredential = Get-Credential
   $sfbSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $userCredential
   Import-PSSession $sfbSession
   ```

2. In the **Windows PowerShell Credential Request** dialog box, type your Skype for Business Online administrator account name and password, and then click **OK**.


## Connect using a Skype for Business Online administrator account with multi-factor authentication

1. Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt and run the following commands:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
   $sfbSession = New-CsOnlineSession
   Import-PSSession $sfbSession
   ```

2. When prompted by the **New-CsOnlineSession** command, enter your Skype for Business Online administrator account name.

3. In the **Sign in to your account** dialog box, type your Skype for Business Online administrator password, and then click **Sign in**.

4. Follow the instructions in the **Sign in to your account** dialog box to provide additional authentication information, such as a verification code, and then click **Verify**.
