# Enabling SharePoint Multi-Geo in your satellite geo location

This article is for Global or SharePoint administrators who have created a Multi-Geo satellite location **before** SharePoint Multi-Geo capabilities became generally available on March 27, 2019, and who have not enabled SharePoint Multi-Geo in their satellite geo location(s). 

>[!Note]
>If you have added a new geo location **after March 27th**, you do not need to perform these instructions, as your new geo location will already be enabled for OneDrive and SharePoint Multi-Geo.

These instructions will allow you to enable SharePoint in your satellite location, so your Multi-Geo satellite users can take advantage of both OneDrive and SharePoint Multi-Geo capabilities in O365. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Please note that this is a one way enablement. Once you set SPO mode, you will not be able to revert your tenant to OneDrive only Multi-Geo mode without an escalation with support. 

## To set a geo location into SPO Mode

To set a geo location into SPO mode, connect to the geo location you want to set in SPO Mode:

1.    Open your SharePoint Online Management Shell 
2.    Connect-SPOService -URL "https://$tenantGeo-admin.sharepoint.com" -Credential $credential
3.    Set-SPOMultiGeoExperience</br></br>
![Set-SPOMultiGeoExperience.](../media/Set-SPO-MultiGeo.jpg)
4.    This operation usually takes about an hour while we perform various publish backs in the service and re-stamp your tenant. After at least 1 hour, please perform a Get-SPOMultiGeoExperience.  This will show you whether this geo location is in SPO mode.</br></br>

>[!Note]
>Certain caches in the service update every 24 hours, so it is possible that for a period of up to 24 hours, your satellite geo may intermittently behave as if it was still in ODB mode. This does not cause any technical issues.
