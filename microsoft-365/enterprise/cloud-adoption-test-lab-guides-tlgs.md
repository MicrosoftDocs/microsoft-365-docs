# Test Microsoft 365 with Test Lab Guides (TLGs)

TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They're great for situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration before you decide whether it's right for you and before you begin the design, planning, and rollout to users. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for hosting it in production.
  
TLGs also create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

## Microsoft 365 dev/test environment

Use these articles to build your Microsoft 365 dev/test environment:
  
- [The lightweight base configuration](lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md)
    
    Create a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription.

- [The simulated enterprise base configuration](simulated-ent-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md)
    
    Create a simplified intranet running in Microsoft Azure infrastructure services and a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription. 

    This is optional and needed if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration for hybrid identity.
    
For additional TLGs that apply to both Office 365 and Microsoft 365, go to [Test Lab Guides](m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides.md).
