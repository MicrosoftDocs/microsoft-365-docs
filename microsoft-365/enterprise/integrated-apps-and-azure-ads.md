# Integrated Apps and Azure AD for Microsoft 365 administrators

There's more to managing integrated apps than just [Turning Integrated Apps on or off](https://support.office.com/article/7e453a40-66df-44ab-92a1-96786cb7fb34#__toc379982114). With the advent of the Microsoft 365 REST APIs, users can grant apps access to their Microsoft 365 data, like mail, calendars, contacts, users, groups, files, and folders. By default, users need to individually grant permissions to each app, but this doesn't scale well if you want to authorize an app once at the global administrator level and roll it out to your whole organization through the app launcher. To do this, you must register the app in Azure AD. There are some steps you need to take before you can register an app in Azure AD and some background information you should know that can help you manage apps in your Microsoft 365 organization. This article points you to those resources.

For example, when someone uses a third-party app, that app might ask for permission to access their calendar and to edit files that are in a OneDrive for Business folder.  <br/> |
