# Integrated apps and Azure AD for Microsoft 365 administrators

There's more to managing integrated apps than just [managing user consent to apps](../admin/misc/user-consent.md). With the advent of the Microsoft 365 REST APIs, users can grant apps access to their Microsoft 365 data, such as mail, calendars, contacts, users, groups, files, and folders. By default, users need to individually grant permissions to each app. 

But this doesn't scale well if you want to authorize an app once at the **Azure AD DC admin**, or **Global admin** level and roll it out to your whole organization through the app launcher. To do this, you must register the app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). There are some steps you need to take before you can register an app in Azure AD and some background information you should know that can help you manage apps in your Microsoft 365 organization.
  
## Azure AD resources for Microsoft 365 admins

You have to do these two tasks before you can manage your Microsoft 365 apps in Azure AD.

|[Use your free Azure AD subscription](../compliance/use-your-free-azure-ad-subscription-in-office-365.md) <br/> |Every paid subscription to Microsoft 365 comes with a free subscription to Azure AD. You can use Azure AD to manage your apps and to create and manage user and group accounts. To use Azure AD, just go to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in using your Microsoft 365 account.  <br/> |
|[Manage user consent to apps](../admin/misc/user-consent.md) <br/> |You must manage user consent to apps to allow third-party apps to access user Microsoft 365 information and for you to register apps in Azure AD. For example, when someone uses a third-party app, that app might ask for permission to access their calendar and to edit files that are in a OneDrive folder.  <br/> |
