## Before you begin

- **Microsoft SharePoint Online Powershell**. Confirm you have the most recent version installed. If not, [Download SharePoint Online Management Shell from Official Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588).
- Be a SharePoint Online admin or Microsoft 365 Global admin on both the source and target tenants

### Connect to both tenants

1. Sign in to the SharePoint Management Shell as a SharePoint Online admin or Microsoft 365 Global admin.
2. Run the following entering the **source** tenant URL:

    ```powershell
    Connect-SPOService -url https://<TenantName>-admin.sharepoint.com
    ```

3. When prompted, sign in to the **source** tenant using your Admin username and password.

4. Run the following entering the **target** tenant URL:

    ```powershell
    Connect-SPOService -url https://<TenantName>-admin.sharepoint.com
    ```

5. When prompted, sign in to the **target** tenant using your Admin username and password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo customers:** You must treat each geography as a separate tenant. Provide the correct geography-specific URLs throughout the migration process.
