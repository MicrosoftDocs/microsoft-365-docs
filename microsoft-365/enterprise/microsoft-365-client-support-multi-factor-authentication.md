# Microsoft 365 Client App Support: Multi-factor authentication

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

To provide an additional level of security for sign-ins, clients may be configured to use multi-factor authentication (MFA), which uses both a user password and another user verification method based on:

- Something  in their possession that is not easily duplicated, such as a smart phone.
- Something the user has uniquely and biologically, such as their fingerprints, face, or other biometric attribute
