# Step 7:  Post migration steps

This is Step 7 in a solution designed to complete a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration. To learn more, see [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration overview](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration.md).

- Step 1: [Connect to the source and the target tenants](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step1.md)
- Step 2: [Establish trust between the source and the target tenant](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step2.md)
- Step 3: [Verify trust has been established](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step3.md)
- Step 4: [Pre-create users and groups](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step4.md)  
- Step 5: [Prepare identity mapping](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step5.md)
- Step 6: [Start a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step6.md)
- **Step 7: [Post migration steps](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step7.md)**

## Removing trust relationship

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you remove the Trust Relationship on both source and target tenants before your source tenant licenses expire. Once the licenses expire, the trust removal command will not work on source.

1. On the source tenant, run this command to remove the trust relationship between Source and Target tenant.

   ```powershell
   Remove-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Target -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <TARGETCrossTenantHostUrl>
   ```

2. On the target tenant, run this command to remove the trust relationship between the target and source tenant.

   ```powershell
   Remove-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Target -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <TARGETCrossTenantHostUrl>
   ```

### Parameter definitions

|Parameter|Definition|
|---|---|
|PartnerRole|Roles of the partner tenant you're establishing trust with. Use *source* if partner tenant is the source of the OneDrive migrations, and *target* if the partner tenant is the destination.|
|PartnerCrossTenantHostURL|The cross-tenant host URL of the partner tenant. The partner tenant can determine this for you by running: *Get-SPOCrossTenantHostURL* on each of the tenants.|

## Other post migration steps

Once the migration is complete, OneDrive users must sign in using their new identity and resync their files to their devices on the target tenant.

### OneDrive for Business

With their new credentials, have users sign in to OneDrive using the Microsoft 365 app launcher or a web browser.

### Permissions on OneDrive content

Users with permission to access OneDrive content will continue to be able to access it, provided they were included in the identity mapping file

### OneDrive Sync Client

The user must sign in to the **OneDrive Sync Client** and their new OneDrive location using their new identity. Once you've completed that step, the files and folders will begin resyncing to the device.

### Sharing Links

The existing shared links for the migrated files will automatically redirect to the new target location.
