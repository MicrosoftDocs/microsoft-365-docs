# Microsoft 365 Enterprise foundation infrastructure

To fully realize the benefits of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you’ll begin your deployment with its foundation infrastructure. 

## Foundation infrastructure for deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise

The foundation infrastructure is the groundwork upon which you can deploy productivity workloads (such as Microsoft Teams and Exchange Online in Office 365) and scenarios (such as migrating to Microsoft 365 and automating client updates). It provides intelligent security and integration that simplifies ongoing management, which ensures that your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.

You'll use the following phases to plan for and deploy the foundation infrastructure of Microsoft 365 Enterprise in your organization:

Before you can exit each phase, you must examine its exit criteria, which is a set of required conditions that you must meet and optional conditions to consider. Exit criteria for each phase ensures that your on-premises and cloud infrastructure and resulting end-to-end configuration meet the requirements for a Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment.

Watch this short video on how the foundation infrastructure content works.

You must be signed on as a global administrator in an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 tenant in order to access this page.

## Next step

If you have existing infrastructure for Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, or Windows 10 Enterprise, see [Deployment of Microsoft 365 Enterprise with existing infrastructure](deploy-with-existing-infrastructure.md). This article steps you through the exit criteria for each phase. With this information, you can more quickly determine what you need to change to make your IT infrastructure Microsoft 365 Enterprise-compliant.

Otherwise, you can begin your Microsoft 365 Enterprise end-to-end deployment journey with [Phase 1: Networking](networking-infrastructure.md).
