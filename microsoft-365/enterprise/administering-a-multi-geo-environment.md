# Administering a multi-geo environment

Here's a look at how Microsoft 365 services work in a multi-geo environment.

## Audit log search

A unified [Audit log](https://support.office.com/article/0d4d0f35-390b-4518-800e-0c7ec95e946c) for all your satellite locations is available from the Microsoft 365 audit log search page. You can see all the audit log entries from across geo locations, for example, NAM & EUR users' activities will show up in one org view and then you can apply existing filters to see specific user's activities.

## BCS, Secure Store, Apps

BCS, Secure Store, and Apps all have separate instances in each satellite location, therefore the SharePoint Online administrator should manage and configure these services separately from each satellite location.

## eDiscovery 

By default, an eDiscovery Manager or Administrator of a multi-geo tenant will be able to conduct eDiscovery only in the central location of that tenant. The Office 365 global administrator must assign eDiscovery Manager permissions to allow others to perform eDiscovery and assign a "Region" parameter in their applicable Compliance Security Filter to specify the region for conducting eDiscovery as satellite location, otherwise no eDiscovery will be carried out for the satellite location. To configure the Compliance Security Filter for a Region, see [Configure Office 365 Multi-Geo eDiscovery](multi-geo-ediscovery-configuration.md).

## Exchange mailboxes

Users' Exchange mailboxes are moved automatically if their PDL is changed. When a new mailbox is created, it is provisioned to the user's PDL or to the central location if no value has been set for the user's PDL.

## Power BI

As a Power BI Premium customer, you can deploy content to datacenters in regions other than the home region of the Power BI tenant. See [Configure Multi-Geo support for Power BI Premium](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-admin-premium-multi-geo)

## Information Protection (IP) Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy

You can set your IP DLP policies for OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, and Exchange in the Security and Compliance center, scoping policies as needed to the whole tenant or to applicable users. For example: If you wish to select a policy for a user in a satellite location, select to apply the policy to a specific OneDrive and enter the user's OneDrive url. See [Overview of data loss prevention policies](https://support.office.com/article/1966b2a7-d1e2-4d92-ab61-42efbb137f5e) for general guidance in creating DLP policies.

The DLP policies are automatically synchronized based on their applicability to each geo location.

Implementing Information Protection and Data Loss prevention policies to all users in a geo location is not an option available in the UI, instead you must select the applicable accounts for the policy or apply the policy globally to all accounts.

## Power Automate

Flows created for the satellite location will use the end point located in the default geo location for the tenant.  Power Automate is not a Multi-Geo service. 

## Microsoft PowerApps

PowerApps created for the satellite location will use the end point located in the central location for the tenant. Microsoft PowerApps is not a Multi-Geo service. 

## OneDrive Administrator Experience

The [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com) has a **Geo locations** tab in the left navigation which features a geo locations map where you can view and manage your geo locations. Use this page to add or delete geo locations for your tenant.

## Security and Compliance Admin Center

There is one central compliance center for a multi-geo tenant: [Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/?rfr=AdminCenter\#/homepage).

## SharePoint storage quota

By default, all geo locations of a multi-geo environment share the available tenant storage quota.  You can also manage the storage quota by allocating a specific quota for a particular geo location. For more information, see [SharePoint storage quotas in multi-geo environments](sharepoint-multi-geo-storage-quota.md).

## Sharing

Administrators can set and manage sharing policies for each of their locations. The OneDrive and SharePoint sites in each geo location will honor only the corresponding geo specific sharing settings. (For example, you can allow [external sharing](https://support.office.com/article/C8A462EB-0723-4B0B-8D0A-70FEAFE4BE85) for your central location, but not for your satellite location or vice versa.) Note that the sharing settings do not allow configuring sharing limitations between geo locations.

## Taxonomy

We support a unified [taxonomy](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/managed-metadata) for enterprise managed metadata across geo locations, with the master being hosted in the central location for your company. We recommend that you manage your global taxonomy from the central location and only add location-specific terms to the satellite location's Taxonomy. Global taxonomy terms will synchronize to the satellite locations.

See [Manage metadata in a multi-geo tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/multigeo-managedmetadata) for additional details and for developer guidance.

## User Profile Application

There is a [user profile application](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/manage-user-profiles) in each geo location. Each user's profile information is hosted in their geo location and available to the administrator for that geo location.

If you have custom profile properties, then we recommend that you use the same profile schema across geographies and populate your custom profile properties either in all geo locations or where needed. For guidance regarding how to populate user profile data programmatically, please refer to the [Bulk User Profile Update API](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/bulk-user-profile-update-api-for-sharepoint-online).

See [Work with user profiles in a multi-geo tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/multigeo-userprofileexperience) for additional details and for developer guidance.

## Video Portal

In a multi-geo tenant, the O365 Video Portal is served only from default geo and all users will be redirected to that central portal url. Hence, the Remote Media Service (RMS) for that region will be used, as follows based on your central location.

Stream is currently available in the following regions:

- North America, hosted in the United States 
- Europe
- Asia Pacific

However, Stream is not yet available in the following regions that are currently supported for Microsoft 365 Video, therefore for these local instances, we will use the RMS that is in the closest supported region.

- Australia
- Canada
- India
- United Kingdom

## Yammer

Yammer is not a Multi-Geo workload. Yammer threads stored in Yammer will be placed in the tenantâ€™s central location. Yammer is rolling out a file storage change which will store Yammer files within SharePoint. Yammer files stored in SharePoint will be placed the SharePoint site associated with the Yammer group. SharePoint group sites are based on PDL logic as outlined in [SharePoint Sites and Groups](multi-geo-capabilities-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-online-in-microsoft-365.md#sharepoint-sites-and-groups).
