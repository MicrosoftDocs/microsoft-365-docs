# Client and server software roadmap for Microsoft 365

Most enterprise organizations have a heterogeneous environment with multiple releases of operating systems, client software, and server software. Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes the most secure versions of these key components of your IT infrastructure with productivity features that are designed to take advantage of cloud technologies.

To maximize the business value of the Microsoft 365 for enterprise integrated suite of products, begin planning and implementing a strategy to migrate releases of:

- The Office client installed on your computers to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise
- Office servers installed on your servers to their equivalent services in Microsoft 365
- Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on your devices to Windows 10 Enterprise

>[!Note]
>Windows 7 reached end of support on **January 14, 2020**. For more information, click [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020).

Accomplishing all of these migrations over time gets your organization closer to the [modern workplace](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/04/27/making-it-simpler-with-a-modern-workplace/), a secure and integrated environment that unlocks teamwork and creativity in your organization, all of which is enabled and empowered by Microsoft 365 for enterprise. 


## Migration for Microsoft Office client products

In many organizations both large and small, you might be using a combination of older versions of the Office client products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These older versions:

- Can be [updated](https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5) with the latest security updates and support fixes, but the process is sometimes manual and might not scale across your organization.
- Are not optimally enabled to leverage Microsoft’s cloud technologies and help you digitally transform your business.
- Do not contain new features.
 
Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, a version of the Office client products that is available with a Microsoft 365 for enterprise license and is installed and updated from the Microsoft cloud. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise includes security updates and the latest features. See [About Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/about-microsoft-365-apps) for more information.

### Office 2007

For versions of Office in the Office 2007 release, the end of support has already passed. See [Office 2007 End of Support Roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/office-2007-end-support-roadmap) for more information.

Rather than upgrading your computers running Office 2007 with Office 2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016, consider:

1. Obtaining and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2007 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or in conjunction with an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs updates automatically and can take advantage of cloud-based services for enhanced security and productivity.

### Office 2010

For versions of Office in the Office 2010 release, the end of support is **October 13, 2020**. For more information, see [Office 2010 end of support roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/office-2010-end-support-roadmap).

Rather than upgrading your computers running Office 2010 with Office 2013 or Office 2016, both of which must be manually updated, consider: 

1. Obtaining and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2010 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or in conjunction with an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs both security and new feature updates automatically and can take advantage of cloud-based services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

### Office 2013 and Office 2016

The end of support roadmap for the Office 2013 and Office 2016 versions of Office has not yet been determined. However, like Office 2010, you must still [install security updates](https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5), which might not scale well depending on the size of your organization.

Rather than keep updating your computers with the latest security updates for Office 2013 or Office 2016 or update your computers from Office 2013 to Office 2016, consider:

1. Obtaining and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2013 or Office 2016 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or in conjunction with an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs both security and new feature updates automatically and can take advantage of cloud-based services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

## Migration for Microsoft Office server products

In many organizations both large and small, you might be using a combination of older versions of the Office Server products, such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server. These older versions:

- Should be updated with the latest security updates and support fixes. In some cases, these updates are released monthly.
- Are not optimally enabled to leverage Microsoft’s cloud technologies and help you digitally transform your business.
- Do not include new productivity applications, such as Microsoft Teams.
- Do not include the latest security features, such as Exchange Advanced Threat Protection.

Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes cloud-based versions of Office server services that use some of the same tools as on-premises versions of Office server software, such as web browsers and the Outlook client. These services are continually updated for security without involving IT, saving you the time it takes to maintain and update on-premises servers. These services also have new features enhancements that are not present in Office server software. 

For information about migrating users and data for specific Microsoft 365 workloads:

- User mailboxes from Exchange Server to Exchange Online, see [Move mailboxes between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-deployment/move-mailboxes).
- SharePoint data from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online, see [Migrate your content to Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online).
- Skype for Business Online to Microsoft Teams, see [Migration and interoperability guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype).

### Office Server 2007

For server products in the Office 2007 release, the end of support has already passed. See these articles for the details:

- [Exchange 2007 end of support roadmap](exchange-2007-end-of-support.md)

Rather than upgrading your server products in the Office 2007 release with server products in the Office 2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016 releases, consider:

1. Migrating the data on your Office 2007 servers to Microsoft 365. To help with this, hire a Microsoft partner.
2. Rolling out the new functionality and work processes to your users.
3. When there is no longer a need for the on-premises servers running Office 2007 server products, decommissioning them.

### Office Server 2010

The end of support for [Exchange Server 2010](exchange-2010-end-of-support.md) is **October 13, 2020**.

The end of support for [SharePoint Server 2010](upgrade-from-sharepoint-2010.md) is **April 13, 2021**.

Rather than upgrading these server products in the Office 2010 release with server products in the Office 2013 or Office 2016 release, consider:

1. Migrating the data on your Office 2010 servers to Microsoft 365. To help with this, see [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365) or hire a Microsoft partner.
2. Rolling out the new functionality and work processes to your users.

1. Migrating the data on your Office 2016 servers to Microsoft 365. To help with this, see [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365) or hire a Microsoft partner.
