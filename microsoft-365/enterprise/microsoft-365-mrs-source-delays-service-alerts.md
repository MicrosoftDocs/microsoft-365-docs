# Service advisories for MRS source delays in Exchange Online monitoring

Mailbox Replication Service (MRS) source delay service advisories inform you of storage limitations or high processor utilization issues on the tenant side (migration source) that might be delaying mailbox migrations in your Microsoft 365 organization. These service advisories also include links to Microsoft resources to help you resolve these issues.

These service advisories are displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To view these service advisories, go to **Health** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842900" target="_blank">**Service health**</a> > **Exchange Online** and then click the **Active issues** tab.

## What do these service advisories indicate?

This service advisory informs you of potential delays to mailbox migrations in your organization. This includes cross-forest migrations, onboarding migrations, and offboarding  migrations. The service advisory contains a table with information about the current migrations in your organization. Here's an example of the table with information about migration delays.

| BatchGuid | ExchangeGuid | RequestGuid | DelayReason |QueuedHours | DelayInHours | SourceServer | RemoteDatabaseName |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567891011|246c21f7-ca3c-4bba-ab5d-23456558c52a|3d7fab16-7d8e-4c81-a849-e0795054292a|DiskLatency|35.2|27.3|RD1GBL01EXCH003|GBL01EDAG001-db002|
|87654321-4321-4321-4321-1101987654321|21e9a608-78c3-44ef-a4dd-d5e7222aae82|9974aeb4-2aa4-4a2c-aeb6-d94d78cc25c9|DiskLatency|0.4|0.9|RD1GBL01EXCH010|GBL01EDAG010-db003|
