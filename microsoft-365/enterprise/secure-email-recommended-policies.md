# Policy recommendations for securing email
This article describes how to implement the recommended identity and device access policies to protect organizational email and email clients that support Modern Authentication and Conditional Access. This guidance builds on the [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md) and also includes a few additional recommendations.


These recommendations are based on three different tiers of security and protection that can be applied based on the granularity of your needs: **baseline**, **sensitive**, and **highly regulated**. You can learn more about these security tiers, and the recommended client operating systems, referenced by these recommendations in the [recommended security policies and configurations introduction](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md).

These recommendations require your users to use modern email clients, including Outlook for iOS and Android on mobile devices. Outlook for iOS and Android provide support for the best features of Office 365. These mobile Outlook apps are also architected with security capabilities that support mobile use and work together with other Microsoft cloud security capabilities. For more information, see [Outlook for iOS and Android FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-faq).

##Updating common policies to include email
The following diagram illustrates the common identity and device access policies and indicates which policies need to be updated to protect email. Note the addition of a new rule for Exchange Online to block ActiveSync clients. This forces the use of Outlook mobile.

![Summary of policy updates for protecting email](../images/identity-access-ruleset-mail.png)

If you included Exchange Online and Outlook in the scope of the policies when you set them up, you only need to create the new policy to block ActiveSync clients. Reveiw the policies listed in the following table and either make the recommended additions, or confirm that these are already incluced. Each rule links to the associated configuration instructions in the [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md) article (links coming soon). 

|Protection level|Policies|More information|
|:---------------|:-------|:----------------|
|**Baseline**|[Require MFA when sign-in risk is *medium* or *high*](identity-access-policies.md#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)|Include Exchange Online in the assignments of cloud apps.|
|        |[Block clients that don't support modern authentication](identity-access-policies.md#block-clients-that-dont-support-modern-authentication)|Include Exchange Online in the assignments of cloud apps.|
|        |[Define app protection policies](identity-access-policies.md#high-risk-users-must-change-password)|Be sure Outlook is included in the list of apps. Be sure to update the policy for each platform (iOS, Android, Windows).|
|        |[Require approved apps](identity-access-policies.md#require-approved-apps)|Include Exchange Online in the list of cloud apps.|
|        |[Require compliant PCs](identity-access-policies.md#require-compliant-pcs-but-not-compliant-phones-and-tablets)|Include Exchange Online in list of cloud apps.|
|        |[Block ActiveSync clients](#block-activesync)|Add this new policy. 
|**Sensitive**|[Require MFA when sign-in risk is *low*, *medium* or *high*](identity-access-policies.md#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)| Include Exchange Online in the assignments of cloud apps.|
|         |[Require compliant PCs *and* mobile devices](identity-access-policies.md#require-compliant-pcs-and-mobile-devices)|Include Exchange Online in the list of cloud apps.|
|**Highly regulated**|[*Always* require MFA](identity-access-policies.md#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)|Include Exchange Online in the assignments of cloud apps |

## Block ActiveSync clients
This policy prevents ActiveSync clients from bypassing other conditional access rules. The rule configuration applies only to ActiveSync clients. By selecting **Require approved client app**, this policy blocks ActiveSync clients. To configure this policy:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure Dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy**.

5. Enter a policy name, then choose the **Users and groups** you want to apply the policy for.

6. Choose **Cloud apps**.

7. Choose **Select apps**, select Office 365 Exchange Online. Click **Select** and **Done**.
8. Choose **Conditions**, and then choose **Client apps**.
9. For **Configure**, select **Yes**. Check only the following: **Mobile apps and desktop clients** and **Exchange ActiveSync clients**. Click **Done**.

10. Choose **Grant** from the **Access controls** section.

11. Choose **Grant access**, select **Require approved client app**.  For multiple controls, select **Require the selected controls**, then choose **Select**. 

12. Click **Create**.

## Setup Office 365 message encryption
With the new Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) capabilities, which leverage the protection features in Azure Information Protection, your organization can easily share protected email with anyone on any device. Users can send and receive protected messages with other Office 365 organizations as well as non-Office 365 customers using Outlook.com, Gmail, and other email services.

For more information, see [Set up new Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities](https://support.office.com/article/set-up-new-office-365-message-encryption-capabilities-7ff0c040-b25c-4378-9904-b1b50210d00e).

This article describes recommended policies to help you secure organizational email and email clients that support Modern Authentication and Conditional Access. These recommendations are in addition to the [common identity and access policy recommendations](identity-access-policies.md).

The following recommendations are based on three different layers of security and protection for your email that can be applied based on the granularity of your needs:

- **Baseline**: Microsoft recommends you establish a minimum standard for protecting data, as well as the identities and devices that access your data. Microsoft provides strong default protection that meets the needs of many organizations. Some organizations require additional capabilities to meet their baseline requirements.
- **Sensitive**: Some customers have a subset of data that must be protected at higher levels. You can apply increased protection to specific data sets in your Office 365 environment. Microsoft recommends protecting identities and devices that access sensitive data with comparable levels of security. 
- **Highly regulated**: Some organizations may have a very small amount of data that is highly classified, trade secret, or regulated data. Microsoft provides capabilities to help organizations meet these requirements, including added protection for identities and devices.

See the [recommended security policies and configurations introduction](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) topic for more details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All security groups created as part of these recommendations must be created with Office features enabled. This is specifically important for the deployment of Azure Information Protection (AIP) when securing documents in SharePoint Online.
>

## Baseline
To create a new conditional access policy: 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure Dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy** as shown in the screen-shot below:

![Baseline CA policy](./media/secure-email/CA-EXO-policy-1.png)

The following tables describe the appropriate settings necessary to express the policies required for each level of protection.

### Medium and above risk requires MFA

The following tables describes the conditional access policy settings to implement for this policy.

10. Click **Create** to create the Exchange Online conditional access policy.

	> [!NOTE]
	> Beginning with Intune on Azure, you have to create all conditional access policies in the Azure Active Directory workload. Intune provides a link to Azure AD conditional access policies workload from its portal  for convenience.

	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> If you need assistance on migrating conditional access policies previously created in the Intune classic portal to the Intune on Azure portal, see the [reassign conditional access policies from Intune classic portal to the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/conditional-access-intune-reassign) topic. 

### App-based conditional access for Exchange Online

You can add one more security layer by setting up an app-based conditional access policy for Exchange Online in the Intune on Azure portal. When you apply an app-based conditional access for Exchange Online you require users to use a specific app (E.g. Microsoft Outlook app) to access corporate e-mail.

To add an app-based conditional access policy:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your Intune credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure Dashboard.

2. Choose **More services** from the left menu, then type: "**Intune**".

3. Choose **Intune App Protection**.

4. On the **Intune mobile application management** blade choose **All Settings**.

5. Choose **Exchange Online** under the **Conditional access** section.

6. Select **Allow apps that support Intune app policies**, then choose the app (E.g. Microsoft Outlook).

7. Choose **Restricted user groups**, click **Select groups**, select the user or group you want to apply the policy for, then click **Select**.

## Additional configurations
In addition to the above policies, you must configure the following Mobile Application and Device Management settings discussed in this section.

### Intune mobile application management

To ensure email is protected by the policy recommendations stated earlier for each security and data protection tier, you must create Intune app protection policies from within the Azure portal.

To create a new app protection policy, log in to the Microsoft Azure portal with your administer credentials, and then navigate to **Intune App Protection > App policy**.

Add a new policy (+Add) as shown in the following screen shot:

![Intune mobile application management](./media/secure-email/CA-EXO-policy-2.png)

>[!NOTE]
>There are slight differences in the app protection policy options between iOS and Android. The below policy is specifically for Android.

For all the above policies to be considered deployed, they must be targeted at user groups. You can do this by creating the policy (on Save) or later by selecting Manage Deployment in the Policy section (same level as Add).

## Remediating medium or high risk access events
If a user reports that they are now expected to perform MFA when this was previously not required, support can review their status from a risk perspective.  

Users within the organization with a Global Administrator or Security Administrator role can use Azure AD Identity Protection to review the risky events that contributed to the calculated risk score. If they identify some events that were flagged as suspicious, but are confirmed to be valid (such as a login from an unfamiliar location when an employee is on vacation), the administrator can resolve the event so it no longer contributes to the risk score.
