# During and after your data move

Data moves are a back-end operation with minimal impact to end users. No action is required while Microsoft moves each service and associated data for your tenant to a new datacenter geo. Data transfer and validation occur in the background in advance with minimal impact to users.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Moves occur at different times for each service. As a result, you'll see the described reduced functionality for each service at a different time.
  
Watch the Microsoft 365 Message Center for confirmation when moves for each of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams chat service complete. As shown in the table below, it can take up to 24 months after the end of the enrollment period to complete core customer data at rest moves to the new datacenter geo.

## Exchange Online

Because it takes time to move each user to the new datacenter geo for a single tenant, some users will still be in the old datacenter geo during the move, while others will be in the new datacenter geo. This means that some features that involve accessing multiple mailboxes may not fully work during a period of the move process, which can last weeks. These features are described in the following sections.
  
### Open "Shared Folder" in Outlook Web Access

Some users open a shared mail folder from another mailbox (that the user has read or write permissions to) in Outlook Web Access using the "Shared Folder" feature. The following table describes how access to shared folders works during a mailbox move. Please note that users with full permissions to a shared mailbox can open the mailbox by using Outlook Web Access during the move.
  
| Configuration | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
|User has mailbox folder permission to another mailbox  <br/> |Potentially limited.  <br/> If User A and Mailbox B aren't in the same geo during the tenant move, User A can't open Mailbox B's folder in Outlook Web Access if User A only has permission to a specific folder in Mailbox B.  <br/> To add a shared folder, right-click the user name in the left navigation panel and select **Add shared folder**.  <br/> |
|User with full mailbox permission to another mailbox  <br/> |Fully supported.  <br/> If User A has "Full Access" permission to Mailbox B, then User A can click the shared folder in the left navigation panel in Outlook Web Access to open a window showing Mailbox B.  A user can open a shared mailbox using Outlook Web Access during the move without any adverse impact. The limitation only applies to folder-level sharing in a mailbox.           |
  
## SharePoint Online

When SharePoint Online is moved, data for the following services is also moved:
  
- OneDrive for Business

- Microsoft 365 Video services

- Office in a browser

- Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise

- Visio Pro for Microsoft 365

After we've completed moving your SharePoint Online data, you might see some of the following effects.
  
### Microsoft 365 Video Services

- The data move for video takes longer than the moves for the rest of your content in SharePoint Online.

- After the SharePoint Online content is moved, there will be a time frame when videos aren't able to be played.

- We're removing the trans-coded copies from the previous datacenter and transcoding them again in the new datacenter.

### Search

In the course of moving your SharePoint Online data, we migrate your search index and search settings to a new location. Until we've **completed** the move of your SharePoint Online data, we continue to serve your users from the index in the original location. In the new location, search automatically starts crawling your content after we've completed moving your SharePoint Online data. From this point and onwards we serve your users from the migrated index. Changes to your content that occurred after the migration aren't included in the migrated index until crawling picks them up. Most customers don't notice that results are less fresh right after we've completed moving their SharePoint Online data, but some customers might experience reduced freshness in the first 24-48 hours.
  
The following search features are affected:
  
- Search results and Search Web Parts: Results don't include changes that occurred after the migration until crawling picks them up. 

- Delve: Delve doesn't include changes that occurred after the migration until crawling picks them up.

- Popularity and Search Reports for the site: Counts for Excel reports in the new location only include migrated counts and counts from usage reports that have run after we completed moving your SharePoint Online data. Any counts from the interim period are lost and can't be recovered. This period is typically a couple of days. Some customers might experience shorter or longer losses.

- Video Portal: View counts and statistics for the Video Portal depend on the statistics for Excel Reports, so view counts and statistics for the Video Portal are lost for the same time period as for the Excel reports.

- eDiscovery: Items that changed during the migration aren't shown until crawling picks up the changes.

- Data Loss Protection (DLP): Policies aren't enforced on items that change until crawling picks up the changes.

As part of the migration, the default region will change and all new content will be stored at rest in the new default region. Existing content will move in the background with no impact to you for up to 90 days after the first change to the SharePoint Online data location in the admin center.

## Microsoft Teams

### Files tab

After the migration is complete the Files tab may take additional time (up to 7 seconds) to fully load when the user first attempts to use it. 

### Read-only period

Teams chat services moves each thread individually.  The thread is locked in a read-only state during the move, which lasts a few seconds per thread.  Threads remain accessible during the migration.

## Skype for Business

Skype for Business moves are no longer available.  [Skype for Business Online will be retired](/lifecycle/announcements/skype-for-business-online-retirement) on July 31, 2021. After that time, the service will no longer be accessible.
