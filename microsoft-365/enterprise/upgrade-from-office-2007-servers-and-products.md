*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

If you're using Office 2007 products and services, be aware that support for these applications has ended. Consider moving to the Microsoft cloud, starting with Microsoft 365. Use this article as a starting point to review your options and plan your upgrade.
