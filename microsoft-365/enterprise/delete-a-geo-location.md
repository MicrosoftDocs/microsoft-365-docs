# Delete a satellite location in Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo

If you no longer need a satellite location, you can delete it from your tenant from the SharePoint admin center.

> [!WARNING]
> All user data in the satellite location will be permanently deleted. This includes all OneDrive for Business content, SharePoint sites and Exchange mailboxes including Microsoft 365 Group mailboxes. You must migrate any data to another satellite location or the central location before you delete the satellite location. This action cannot be undone.

Only global administrators can delete satellite locations.
