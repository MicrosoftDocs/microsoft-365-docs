# Advanced deployment guides for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 products

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 advanced deployment guides give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying your tenant, apps, and services. These guides are created using the same best practices that [Microsoft 365 FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365) onboarding specialists share in individual interactions. They provide information on product setup, enabling security features, deploying collaboration tools, and provide scripts to speed up advanced deployments.

All advanced deployment guides are available in the Microsoft 365 admin center as described in the section below, and most guides can also be found in the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2220880).

Access to advanced deployment guides in the admin center requires authentication to a Microsoft 365 tenant as an administrator or other role with access to the admin center. Advanced deployment guides in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal can be accessed by anyone. We have provided links to both locations for each guide, where available, in the tables below.

Note that guides are still being added to the setup portal, but there are a few guides that will only be available in the admin center because they require authentication to a tenant to function.

In this article:

- [How to access advanced deployment guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center](#how-to-access-advanced-deployment-guides-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center)
- [Guides for initial setup](#guides-for-initial-setup)
- [Guides for authentication and access](#guides-for-authentication-and-access)
- [Guides for security and compliance](#guides-for-security-and-compliance)
- [Guides for collaboration](#guides-for-collaboration)

## How to access advanced deployment guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Advanced deployment guides are accessible from the [Advanced deployment guides & assistance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224913) page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. When you access advanced deployment guides from the admin center, you can keep track of the status of your progress and return at any time to complete a guide. This functionality is not available when you access guides from the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2220880).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be assigned an admin role such as _Global Reader_ to access advanced deployment guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Only admins with the _Global Administrator_ role can use the guides to change settings in the tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any selections, task assignments, and progress status saved **before January 10, 2023** within each advanced deployment guide in the admin center has been reset due to EU data regulations.

To reach the **Advanced deployment guides & assistance** page:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224913), go to the **Home** page.

2. Find the _Training, guides & assistance_ card and click **Advanced deployment guides & assistance**.
