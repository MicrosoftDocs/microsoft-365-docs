# Setup guides for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 setup guides give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying your tenant, apps, and services. These guides are created using the same best practices that [Microsoft 365 FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365) onboarding specialists share in individual interactions, and they're available to all admins within the Microsoft 365 admin center. They give information on product setup, enabling security features, deploying collaboration tools, and provide scripts to speed up advanced deployments.

## How to access setup guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The setup guides are accessible from the [Setup guidance](https://aka.ms/setupguidance) page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can keep track of the status of your progress and you have the option to return at any time to complete a guide. To reach the **Setup guidance** page:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), go to the **Home** page.

2. Find the **Training & guides** card. 

   ![Training & guides card in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/setup-guides-for-microsoft-365/adminportal-trainingandguides.png)

3. Select **Customized setup guidance**.

>Tenant administrator permissions are required to access the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## How do setup guides work in the Microsoft 365 admin center?

Each guide provides you with step-by-step instructions, resources, articles, and when needed, scripts you can use to make configuration changes. These guides provide you with choices that reflect the specific needs of both small and large organizations. Additionally, the guidance includes assistance for both new and more experienced admins.

![Example of a setup guide](../media/setup-guides-for-microsoft-365/m365-setupguide-example.png)

You can use the guides to learn more about specific Microsoft 365 and Office 365 features during the planning phase, during deployment and rollout, or to revisit them after you've completed a deployment to modify a setting.
