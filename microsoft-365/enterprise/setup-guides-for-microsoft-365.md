# Setup guides for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 setup guides give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying your tenant, apps, and services. These guides are created using the same best practices that [Microsoft 365 FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365) onboarding specialists share in individual interactions, and they're available to all admins within the Microsoft 365 admin center. They give information on product setup, enabling security features, deploying collaboration tools, and provide scripts to speed up advanced deployments.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be assigned an admin role like Global Reader to access the Microsoft 365 setup guides. Only admins with the Global Administrator role can use the guides to change settings in the tenant.

## How to access setup guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The setup guides are accessible from the [Setup guidance](https://aka.ms/setupguidance) page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can keep track of the status of your progress and return at any time to complete a guide. To reach the **Setup guidance** page:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), go to the **Home** page.

2. Find the **Training & guides** card.

   ![Training & guides card in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/setup-guides-for-microsoft-365/adminportal-trainingandguides.png)

3. Select **Advanced deployment guides** and then select **All guides**.

## Guides for initial setup

### Prepare your environment

The [Prepare your environment](https://aka.ms/prepareyourenvironment) guide helps you prepare your organization's environment for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services. Whatever your goals are, there are tasks you'll need to complete to ensure a successful deployment. To avoid any errors while preparing your environment, you're provided with step-by-step instructions to connect your domain, add users, assign licenses, set up email with Exchange Online, and install or deploy Office apps.

### Email setup guide

The [Email setup guide](https://aka.ms/office365setup) provides you with the step-by-step guidance needed for configuring Exchange Online for your organization. This guidance includes setting up new email accounts, migrating email, and configuring email protection. For a successful email setup, use this advisor and you'll receive the recommended migration method based on your organization's current mail system, the number of mailboxes being migrated, and how you want to manage users and their access.

### Migrate Gmail contacts and calendar items

When you migrate a Gmail user's mailbox to Microsoft 365, email messages are migrated, but contacts and calendar items are not. The [Gmail contacts and calendar advisor](https://aka.ms/gmailcontactscalendar) provides steps for importing Google contacts and Google calendar items to Microsoft 365 using import and export methods with Outlook.com, the Outlook client, or PowerShell.

### Microsoft 365 setup guide

The [Microsoft 365 setup guide](https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide) provides you with guidance when setting up productivity tools, security policies, and device management capabilities. With a Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft 365 for enterprise subscription, you can use this advisor to set up and configure your organization's devices.

You'll receive guidance and access to resources to enable your cloud services, update devices to the latest supported version of Windows 10, and join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), all in one central location.

### Remote work setup guide

The [Remote work setup guide](https://aka.ms/remoteworksetup) provides organizations with the tips and resources needed to ensure your users can successfully work remotely, your data is secure, and users' credentials are safeguarded.

You'll receive guidance to optimize remote workers' device traffic to both Microsoft 365 resources in the cloud and your organization's network, which will reduce the strain on your remote access VPN infrastructure.

### Microsoft Edge setup guide

Microsoft Edge has been rebuilt from the ground up to bring you world-class compatibility and performance, the security and privacy you deserve, and new features designed to bring you the best of the web.

The [Microsoft Edge setup guide](https://aka.ms/edgeadvisoradmin) will help you configure Enterprise Site Discovery to see which sites accessed in your org might need to use IE mode, review and configure important security features, configure privacy policies and compliance policies to meet your org's requirements, and manage web access on your devices. You can download Microsoft Edge to individual devices, or we'll show you how to deploy to multiple users in your org with Group Policy, Configuration Manager, or Microsoft Intune.

### Configure IE mode for Microsoft Edge

If you've already deployed Microsoft Edge and only want to configure IE mode, the [Configure IE mode for Microsoft Edge guide](https://aka.ms/configureiemodeadmin) will give you scripts to automate the configuration of Enterprise Site Discovery. You'll also get IE mode recommendations from a cloud-based tool that will help you create an Enterprise Mode Site List to deploy to your users.

### Microsoft Search setup guide

You'll assign Search admins and Search editors and then customize the search experience for your users with answers and more options, like adding the Bing extension to Chrome or setting Bing as your default search engine.

## Guides for authentication and access

### Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA)

The [Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) guide](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/featureexplorer/security/ConditionalAccess) provides information to secure your organization against breaches due to lost or stolen credentials. MFA immediately increases account security by prompting for multiple forms of verification to prove a user's identity when they sign in to an app or other company resource. This prompt could be to enter a code on the user's mobile device or to provide a fingerprint scan. MFA is enabled through Conditional Access, security defaults, or per-user MFA. This guide will provide the recommended MFA option for your org, based on your licenses and existing configuration.

### Identity security for Teams

The [Identity security for teams guide](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/teamsidentity) helps you with some basic security steps you can take to ensure your users are safe and have the most productive time using **Teams**.

- Windows Hello for Business
- The Microsoft Authenticator app
