# Microsoft 365 Client App Support: Certificate-based Authentication

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

Modern authentication is an umbrella term for a combination of authentication and authorization methods. These methods include:

- **Authentication methods**: Multi-factor Authentication; Client Certificate-based authentication.
- **Authorization methods**: Microsoft's implementation of Open Authorization (OAuth).

Modern authentication is enabled by using an authentication library, like [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview). Modern authentication is what clients use to authenticate and authorize access to Microsoft 365 resources. Modern authentication uses OAuth and provides a secure mechanism for clients to access Microsoft 365 services, without requiring access to user credentials. At sign-in, the user authenticates directly with Azure Active Directory and receives an access/refresh token pair in return. The access token grants the client access to the appropriate resources in the Microsoft 365 tenant. A refresh token is used to obtain a new access or refresh token pair when the current access token expires.

Modern authentication supports different authentication mechanisms, like certificate-based authentication. Clients on Windows, Android, or iOS devices can use certificate-based authentication (CBA) to authenticate to Azure Active Directory using a client certificate on the device. Instead of a typical username/password, the certificate is used to obtain an access/refresh token pair from Azure Active Directory.

## Supported clients & platforms

The latest versions of the following clients and platforms support certificate-based authentication when signing into Azure Active Directory accounts within the client (for example, when adding an account to the app). For more information about platform support in Microsoft 365, see [System requirements for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources).

> [!NOTE]
> Edge for iOS and Android supports certificate-based authentication during account add flows. Edge for Android does not support certificate-based authentication when performing authentication against websites, which are typically intranet sites. <br><br>  In this scenario, a user navigates to a website (usually on the intranet) where the website requires the user to authenticate via a certificate. This does not involve modern authentication at all and does not leverage a Microsoft authentication library.
