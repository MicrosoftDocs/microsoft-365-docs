# Delete Microsoft 365 user accounts with PowerShell

You can use PowerShell for Microsoft 365 to delete and restore user accounts.

>[!Note]
>Learn how to [restore a user account](../admin/add-users/restore-user.md) by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Use Microsoft Graph PowerShell to delete a user account

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) PowerShell module is being deprecated and replaced by the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. You can use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to access all Microsoft Graph APIs. For more information, see [Get started with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started).
>
> Also see [Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) and [Upgrade from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps) for information on how to install and upgrade to Microsoft Graph PowerShell, respectively.
>
> For information about how to use different methods to authenticate ```Connect-Graph``` in an unattended script, see the article [Authentication module cmdlets in Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/authentication-commands).

Deleting a user account requires the User.ReadWrite.All permission scope, which is listed in the ['Assign license' Microsoft Graph API reference page](/graph/api/user-assignlicense).

The User.Read.All permission scope is required to read the user account details in the tenant.

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md).

```powershell
# Connect to your tenant
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All
```

After you connect, use the following syntax to remove an individual user account:
  
```powershell
$userName="<display name>"
# Get the user
$userId = (Get-MgUser -Filter "displayName eq '$userName'").Id
# Remove the user
Remove-MgUser -UserId $userId -Confirm:$false
```

This example removes the user account *calebs\@litwareinc.com*.

```powershell
$userName="Caleb Sills"
$userId = (Get-MgUser -Filter "displayName eq '$userName'").Id
Remove-MgUser -UserId $userId -Confirm:$false
```

## Restore a user account

To a restore a user account using Microsoft Graph PowerShell, first [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md). Note that in this instance, you'll be restoring a directory item, so adding the permission scope *Directory.ReadWrite.All* is required.

```powershell
# Connect to your tenant
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes User.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All
```

After you connect, use the following syntax to restore an individual user account:

```powershell
# Get the user
$user = Get-MgUser -Filter "userPrincipalName eq '<user principal name>'"
# Restore the user
Restore-MgDirectoryDeletedItem -DirectoryObjectId $user.Id
```

This example restores the user account *calebs\@litwareinc.com*.

```powershell
$user = Get-MgUser -Filter "userPrincipalName eq 'calebs@litwareinc.com'"
Restore-MgDirectoryDeletedItem -DirectoryObjectId $user.Id
```
