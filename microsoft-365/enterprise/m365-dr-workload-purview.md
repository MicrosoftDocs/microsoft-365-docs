# Data Residency for Microsoft Purview

Data residency commitments for the Purview set of services, as described below, are available with the Advanced Data Residency add-on.
The required conditions for the related commitments for the services described below are:

1. _Tenant_ has a sign up country/region included in _Local Region Geography_ or _Expanded Local Region Geography_.
1. _Tenant_ has a valid Advanced Data Residency subscription for all users in the _Tenant_.
1. The Purview service Customer Data is provisioned in _Local Region Geography_ or _Expanded Local Region Geography_.

## Migration

Customer Data supporting Purview services is closely aligned with the Exchange Online and SharePoint Online services, and the bulk of the data migrated, if required to fulfill the data residency commitments for the Purview services, will be handled by those services. In the cases where supporting Customer Data is maintained in an Azure Service, for example, the migration of that data is tied to the migration of the underlying Exchange Online/SharePoint Online data.

## How can I determine Customer Data location?

We are in the process of updating the actual data location in _Tenant_ Admin Center.  When this change is complete you will be able to see the actual data location, for committed data, by navigating to Admin->Settings->Org Settings->Organization Profile->Data Location.  Until that change is visible, you can view the Exchange Online data location information in order to understand where your committed data is stored for this service.

### Information Protection - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

#### Summary

ADR applies to the following services within Purview Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention (DLP):

- Office 365 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for emails and files
- DLP for Teams chat

Service documentation: [Learn about data loss prevention](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp)

Capability summary:

Organizations have sensitive information under their control such as financial data, proprietary data, credit card numbers, health records, or social security numbers. To help protect this sensitive data and reduce risk, they need a way to prevent their users from inappropriately sharing it with people who shouldn't have it. This practice is called data loss prevention (DLP).

In Microsoft Purview, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. With a DLP policy, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive items across:

- Microsoft 365 services such as Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive
- Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
- Windows 10, Windows 11 and macOS (Catalina 10.15 and higher) endpoints
- non-Microsoft cloud apps
- on-premises file shares and on-premises SharePoint.

DLP detects sensitive items by using deep content analysis, not by just a simple text scan. Content is analyzed for primary data matches to keywords, by the evaluation of regular expressions, by internal function validation, and by secondary data matches that are in proximity to the primary data match. Beyond that DLP also uses machine learning algorithms and other methods to detect content that matches your DLP policies.
