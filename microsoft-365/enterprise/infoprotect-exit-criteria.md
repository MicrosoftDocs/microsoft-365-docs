# Information protection infrastructure exit criteria

![](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/infoprotection_icon-small.png)

Before you are complete with your foundation infrastructure, make sure that your information protection infrastructure meets these conditions.

## Required: Security and information protection levels for your organization are defined

You've planned for and determined the security levels that your organization needs. These levels define a minimum level of security and additional levels for increasingly sensitive information and their required data security.

At a minimum, you are using three security levels:

- Baseline
- Sensitive
- Highly regulated

If needed, [Step 1](infoprotect-define-sec-infoprotect-levels.md) can help you meet this requirement.

## Required: Conditional access policies are configured

You've used the information in these articles to create the set of recommended conditional access policies:

- [Identity and device access policies overview](identity-device-policies.md)
- [Secure email recommended policies](secure-email-recommended-policies.md)
- [Recommended secure document policies](sharepoint-file-access-policies.md)

You've configured these policies and applied them to the three recommended security levels or their equivalents in your organization.

If needed, [Step 2](infoprotect-configure-conditional-access-policy-settings.md) can help you meet this requirement.

## Required: Increased security for Office 365 is configured

You've configured the following settings for increased security based on the information in [Configure your Office 365 tenant for increased security](https://support.office.com/article/Configure-your-Office-365-tenant-for-increased-security-8d274fe3-db51-4107-ba64-865e7155b355):

- Threat management policies in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center
- Additional Exchange Online tenant-wide settings
- Tenant-wide sharing policies in SharePoint admin center
- Settings in Azure Active Directory

You've also [enabled Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-ATP-for-SharePoint-OneDrive-and-Microsoft-Teams-26261670-db33-4c53-b125-af0662c34607#turniton).

If needed, [Step 4](infoprotect-configure-increased-security-office-365.md) can help you meet this requirement.

## Optional: Classification is configured across your environment

You've worked with your legal and compliance teams to develop an appropriate classification and labeling scheme for your organization’s data, which include the following:

- Sensitive data types
- Office 365 labels
- Azure Information Protection labels

If needed, [Step 3](infoprotect-configure-classification.md) can help you meet this requirement. 


## Next Step

You're now ready to deploy [workloads and scenarios](deploy-workloads.md), such as Microsoft Teams and Exchange Online, that run on top of your Microsoft 365 Enterprise foundation infrastructure.
