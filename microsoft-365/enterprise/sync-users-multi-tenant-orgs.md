# Synchronize users in multitenant organizations in Microsoft 365 (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Multitenant organizations in Microsoft 365 is available in [targeted release](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365).

For users in your tenant to be able to collaborate with those in other tenants, you must synchronize your users to the other tenants.

We recommend that you [set up security groups in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) and add the users that you want to synchronize. Note that users must be members of the security group - owners of the group aren't synchronized.

There are two ways to set up user synchronization:

- Share your users with other tenants in a multitenant organization by using the Microsoft 365 admin center (covered in this article)
- [Configure user synchronization in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure)

Both methods use cross-tenant synchronization in Microsoft Entra ID.

If you want to synchronize the same users with all the other tenants in a multitenant organization, we recommend sharing users in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This creates the necessary configurations in Microsoft Entra ID for you.

If you want to synchronize different users to different tenants, then you must configure cross-tenant synchronization directly in Microsoft Entra ID.

While you can create multiple cross-tenant synchronization configurations for a single external tenant, we recommend that you only use one for ease of administration.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 24 hours for synced users to be available in Microsoft 365 services such as Teams and SharePoint.

For more information about cross-tenant synchronization, see [What is cross-tenant synchronization?](/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-overview).

If you have issues with user synchronization check the [provisioning logs in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs).

## User property synchronization

When you set up user synchronization with another tenant in a multitenant organization, the following user properties are synchronized:

|Property|Property|
|:-------|:-------|
|accountEnabled|physicalDeliveryOfficeName|
|alternativeSecurityIds|postalCode|
|city|preferredLanguage|
|country|showInAddressList|
|department|state|
|displayName|streetAddress|
|employeeId|surname|
|givenName|telephoneNumber|
|IsSoftDeleted|userPrincipalName|
|jobTitle|UserType (member)|
|mailNickname||

You can change the properties that are synchronized after the synchronization has been configured. For more information, see [Configure cross-tenant synchronization](/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure#step-9-review-attribute-mappings).

#### Profile card experience

The [profile card](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e80f931f-5fc4-4a59-ba6e-c1e35a85b501) is a feature that allows users to view information about another user, such as email, phone number, and office location. It's available in most Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, Outlook, SharePoint and Viva Engage. Users in multitenant organizations can see information about users in other tenants that are part of the multitenant organization. What users can see depends on what data is being synchronized between the tenants. (Note that some properties [require additional configuration](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-overview#attributes) to be displayed.)

The [new Teams desktop client](/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin) fetches some data directly from the other tenants in the multitenant organization to create a richer experience. In a multitenant organization, when a user looks at the profile card for a user in another tenant in Teams, the name, contact information, and job information is available in 1:1 chats and shared channels without the need for property synchronization to be configured. (These properties are retrieved by Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access and Teams external access.) To see these properties elsewhere in Teams, such as channels, group chats, and chats with guest accounts, you need to include them as part of user synchronization.

In a multitenant organization, the profile picture is always available and is retrieved from the user's home tenant.

For the most consistent profile card experience, keep in mind the following:

- Don't change property values as they're synced, or users will see different values in different tenants.
- [LinkedIn account connections](/entra/identity/users/linkedin-integration) configurations may vary across tenants.

## Users synchronized to your tenant from other tenants

Users synchronized to your tenant from other tenants in your multitenant organization are synchronized as [Microsoft Entra members rather than guests](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/user-properties).

As members, people from other tenants have a more seamless collaboration experience. This includes access to files using [*people in your organization* sharable links](/sharepoint/shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization). (Consider using [sensitivity labels](/purview/sensitivity-labels) if you need to limit who can access a file with a *people in your organization* link.)

If some people from the other tenant already have guest accounts in your directory, the synchronization process doesn't change their user type to member. You can change these users' user type to member by [updating the user properties in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-user-profile-info).

## Set up initial user synchronization for a multitenant organization

To synchronize identities to other tenants in a multitenant organization

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as a global administrator.
1. Expand **Settings** and select **Org settings**.
1. On the **Organization profile** tab, select **Multitenant collaboration**.
1. Select **Share users**.
1. Select **Select users and groups to share**.
1. Choose the security group that you created, and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm.

This creates a cross-tenant synchronization configuration in Microsoft Entra ID for each tenant in your multitenant organization. The synchronization configurations are named *MTO_Sync_\<TenantID\>*.

## Set up user synchronization with newly added tenants

If you add additional tenants to your multitenant organization, you need to set up user synchronization with those tenants.

To set up user synchronization with newly added tenants

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as a global administrator.
1. Expand **Settings** and select **Org settings**.
1. On the **Organization profile** tab, select **Multitenant collaboration**.
1. Select **Share users**.
1. Select **Share current user scope**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm.

## Change which users are synchronized with other tenants

You can change which users are synchronized to other tenants in your multitenant organization.

To change which users are synchronized to other tenants

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as a global administrator.
1. Expand **Settings** and select **Org settings**.
1. On the **Organization profile** tab, select **Multitenant collaboration**.
1. Select **Share users**.
1. Select **Edit shared users and groups**.
1. Update the users and groups that you want to sync to other tenants and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm.

This procedure updates the *MTO_Sync_\<TenantID\>* synchronization configurations in Microsoft Entra ID for each tenant in your multitenant organization.
