If you’ve been following the deployment process wheel till now, you’ve at least partially completed the steps for device and app readiness, prepared your infrastructure, configured and collected app packages, have a plan in place for migrating user files and configuring default settings as well as have plans for retaining your existing security controls and perhaps deploying new ones.

Now we’ve arrived at the stage where you’re putting all these pieces together to automate as much as you can to install Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus, along with the necessary drivers, apps and whatever else is needed.

Ultimately, the best measure of success with an OS deployment is meeting user expectations and avoiding disruptions in their work. And in this step, you’ll start testing and deploying to pilot users as part of a phased deployment. And one tip here, before you broaden deployment, you’ll need to skip ahead to step 8 on our deployment process wheel – [User Communications and Training](https://aka.ms/mdd8) to make sure users are informed and prepared for changes coming their way and that you can measure your roll-out pace with continuous validation using Phased Deployment.

## Windows Imaging Process

Most organizations use the process of PC imaging to configure and capture a clone of Windows, including a base set of a few standard apps installed, or an even a thinner image with only application runtimes and updates. The best way to do this is using a virtual machine for this process to avoid any unexpected driver-related compatibility issues and for automation purposes.

If going the image capture route, it’s best to automate as much as possible to ensure the best quality image and a repeatable process. For most deployments, it is also recommended to put as little customization and pre-installed apps as possible in the Windows image prior to capturing. This is what is called a ‘thin image’ approach, which can save overall bandwidth on the network by eliminating the number of apps within the image. By starting with a thin base image, you can layer on required apps, languages and configurations dynamically tailored to users.

During the build and capture process, tools like System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch) and the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit use the System Preparation Tool – or Sysprep – along with the “Generalize” command to reseal your image before they capture the Windows 10 installation as an image.

The captured image will have the Windows image – or WIM – format like standard Windows installation media. Once you have your custom WIM file, you can use another task sequence as part of your OS deployment in System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit to perform deployment-related tasks, to apply the image and run tasks before and after your Windows image is applied.

### Deployment Types

With your custom image ready, the installation or migration type will fall into the following categories:

  - First, **bare metal deployment**. This is the scenario used to deploy an image to a clean disk, or to reimage a computer where you don’t intend to keep any of the data on the disk

  - And second, similar to bare metal, is **Computer Refresh,** with the key difference that user state remains on the disk\* or will be restored after the install is complete

  - And last is **Computer Replacement**. Here as the name implies, you are replacing a PC with another PC. In this case, there is often a backup of user files from the first PC to a central location, then a restore of those files to the second PC.

All three of these scenarios have something in common, they use a task sequence to run, and a custom image can be applied each time.

### In-place Upgrade using Task Sequence Automation

In addition to these deployment types, there is a new option available now as a System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch) Task Sequence with Windows 10 – and in-place upgrade using the Upgrade Task Sequence.

In-place upgrades from a previous version of Windows do not require a task sequence, but it is a recommended approach when deploying at enterprise scale. An in-place upgrade does not allow you to apply a custom image with applications, but you can update the default install.wim using offline servicing. For example, you can to make sure it has the latest Windows updates applied prior to performing upgrades.

In-place upgrade uses windows setup. The setup engine runs several small pre-installation checks looking for known compatibility issues. It also preserves the user state and applications and only removes what isn’t compatible with the version of Windows 10 being installed. With this option, previously installed applications and user state are preserved. In-place upgrade also allows you to roll-back to the previous OS installed if needed for troubleshooting purposes.

The in-place upgrade scenario can be used to migrate to Windows 10 from legacy versions of Windows, as well as upgrade from previous versions of Windows 10. After Windows Setup completes the upgrade, your task sequence can continue to run and upgrade applications like Office, replace drivers, and apply personalization settings. Likewise, you can use the Upgrade Task Sequence to perform pre-installation tasks or checks prior to carrying out the upgrade.

### Phased Deployment

As you're planning your deployment, you'll be targeting computers for bare metal, refresh, replace and upgrade paths. The recommended approach in this case is to use phased deployment to collections of similar machines. This way, you can validate compatibility, delivery and automation, user acceptance, network bandwidth consumption, and other factors before increasing the scale of your deployment.

### Recommended Tools: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch) and the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit

Regardless of the deployment type you choose, you’ll want to make sure it’s as automated as possible for predictability and repeatability. Microsoft offers two solutions to automate OS deployment using automated task sequences:

  - **[System Center Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/understand/introduction)** (ConfigMgr) provides built-in operating system deployment capabilities to complement its capabilities for software distribution and software update management. ConfigMgr is widely used by organizations of all sizes and supports all four Windows deployment types. Optionally, you can integrate ConfigMgr with Microsoft Intune to add additional capabilities for deployment and device management.

  - And one other popular deployment option is the free **[Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/deploy-windows-mdt/get-started-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit)** (MDT) which is typically used by small and medium sized organizations for OS deployment. This requires very little infrastructure. MDT integrates with Windows Deployment Services (WDS) for network boot. It supports all four deployment types as well as installation of applications, drivers, and settings. And of course, MDT can even be integrated with Configuration Manager.

### Windows Autopilot

A new option with Windows 10 is to configure new PCs as part of your hardware refresh cycle using Windows Autopilot. Here you can work with supporting hardware vendors to customize the default Windows setup experience – for example by eliminating options presented to users, like Licensing Agreements or diagnostic data settings.

Then, when a user signs in to the PC during setup using their Azure AD credentials, the device enrolls into Microsoft Intune, which can then take over the deployment process and apply applications, software updates configurations and compliance policies. Windows Autopilot can also optionally prevent the user from accessing the first session until provisioning is complete.

## Windows Update for Business for Feature Updates

Windows Update for Business is a free service that enables IT Pros to keep Windows 10 devices always up to date by directly connecting the devices to the Windows Update service. Windows Update for Business can be configured via Group Policy or through MDM solutions such as Microsoft Intune and allows IT Pros to create [deployment rings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates) to validate new builds. It is integrated into existing management tools such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch), and Microsoft Intune. Additionally, Windows Update for Business supports peer-to-peer delivery to help optimize bandwidth efficiency and reduce network congestion.

For more detailed information on Windows Update for Business please review the following documentation:
