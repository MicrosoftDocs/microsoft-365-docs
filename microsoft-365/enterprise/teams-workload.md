# Deploy Microsoft Teams for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

*This workload is included in both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

Microsoft Teams brings together chat, conferencing, document sharing, and threaded conversations in a way that makes it easy to create and share content across groups. Teams is the way you do teamwork and collaboration for Microsoft 365 Enterprise and is a key element of the Built for Teamwork value of Microsoft 365. 

If you're brand new to Teams, see [Welcome to Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-overview). 


## Roll out Teams to your organization

Before you begin:

- Make sure you've configured the right [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) phases so that your teams have the user accounts and security capabilities you need. The Identity and Information Protection phases are the most important for signing on and using securing email and files with retention and sensitivity labels.
- Learn about security and compliance in Teams with [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/security-compliance-overview).
- Learn about Office 365 licensing for Teams with [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/office-365-licensing).

To roll out Teams in your organization, read [How to roll out Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/how-to-roll-out-teams).

For your first set of Teams capabilities, see [Chat, teams, channels, and apps in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page).

For more advanced Teams capabilities, see:

- [Meetings and Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page)
- [Cloud voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) (requires Microsoft 365 E5)

To monitor your organization's usage of Teams, see:
