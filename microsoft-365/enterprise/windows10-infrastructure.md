## Windows 10 deployment

There are multiple ways you can deploy Windows 10 Enterprise for your organization. Here, we'll focus on how you can configure and deploy a Windows 10 Enterprise image through these modern deployment scenarios.

| Deployment scenario | When to use it |
|:--- |:--- |
| [Using System Center Configuration Manager as an in-place upgrade](windows10-deploy-inplaceupgrade.md) | Select this option if you need to upgrade Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 computers to the <a href="https://aka.ms/windows-10-release-information" target="_blank">current version</a> of Windows 10 Enterprise and your computers are currently managed with <a href="https://aka.ms/introtosccm" target="_blank">System Center Configuration Manager (Current branch)</a>. |
| [Using Windows Autopilot](windows10-deploy-autopilot.md) | Select this option if you are setting up new Windows computers that have Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1703 or later pre-installed. End users will initiate setup using your desired configuration by entering their work or school account credentials. |

If these deployment scenarios do not fit the needs of your organization, you can learn about other scenarios and understand the capabilities and limitations of each in [Windows 10 deployment scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-deployment-scenarios). You can also <a href="https://aka.ms/planforwin10deployment" target="_blank">plan for Windows 10 deployment</a> on your own.
