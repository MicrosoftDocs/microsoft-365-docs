# Add or remove a _Geography_ administrator in Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo

You can configure separate administrators for each _Geography_ location that you have in your _Tenant_. These administrators will have access to the SharePoint Online and OneDrive settings that are specific to their _Geography_ location.

Some services - such as the term store - are administered from the _Primary Provisioned Geography_ location and replicated to _Satellite Geography_ locations. The _Geography_ admin for the _Primary Provisioned Geography_ location has access to these, whereas _Geography_ admins for _Satellite Geography_ locations don't.

Global administrators and SharePoint Online administrators continue to have access to settings in the _Primary Provisioned Geography_ location and all _Satellite Geography_ locations.

## Configuring _Geography_ administrators

Configuring _Geography_ admins requires SharePoint Online PowerShell module.

Use [Connect-SPOService](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Connect-SPOService) to connect to the admin center of the _Geography_ location where you want to add the _Geography_ admin. (For example, Connect-SPOService  https://ContosoEUR-admin.sharepoint.com.)

To view the existing _Geography_ admins of a location, run `Get-SPOGeoAdministrator`

## Adding a user as a _Geography_ admin

To add a user as a _Geography_ admin, run `Add-SPOGeoAdministrator -UserPrincipalName <UPN>`

To remove a user as a _Geography_ Admin of a location, run  `Remove-SPOGeoAdministrator -UserPrincipalName <UPN>`

## Adding a group as a _Geography_ admin

You can add a security group or a mail-enabled security group as a _Geography_ admin. (Distribution groups and Microsoft 365 Groups are not supported.)

To add a group as a _Geography_ administrator, run `Add-SPOGeoAdministrator -GroupAlias <alias>`

To remove a group as a _Geography_ administrator, run `Remove-SPOGeoAdministrator -GroupAlias <alias>`

Note that not all security groups have a group alias. If you want to add a security group that does not have an alias, run [Get-MsolGroup](/powershell/module/msonline/get-msolgroup) to retrieve a list of groups, find your security group's ObjectID, and then run:

`Add-SPOGeoAdministrator -ObjectID <ObjectID>`

To remove a group by using the ObjectID, run `Remove-SPOGeoAdministrator -ObjectID <ObjectID>`
