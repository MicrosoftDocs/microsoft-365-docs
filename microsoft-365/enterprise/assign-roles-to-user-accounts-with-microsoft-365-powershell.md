# Assign roles to Microsoft 365 user accounts with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

You can quickly and easily assign roles to user accounts using PowerShell for Microsoft 365.

>[!Note]
>To assign roles to user accounts with the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles).
>

## Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module) using a global administrator account.
  
Next, determine the sign-in name of the user account that you want to add to a role (example: fredsm@contoso.com). This is also known as the user principal name (UPN).

Next, determine the name of the role. Use this [list of administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles).

>[!Note]
>Pay attention to the notes in this article. Some role names are different for Azure AD PowerShell. For example, the "SharePoint Administrator" role in the Microsoft 365 admin center is named "SharePoint Service Administrator" for Azure AD PowerShell.
>

Next, fill in the sign-in and role names and run these commands.
  
```powershell
$userName="<sign-in name of the account>"
$roleName="<role name>"
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
if ($role -eq $null) {
$roleTemplate = Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleTemplate | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
Enable-AzureADDirectoryRole -RoleTemplateId $roleTemplate.ObjectId
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
}
Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userName}).ObjectID
```

Here is an example of a completed command set that assigns the SharePoint Service Administrator role to the belindan@contoso.com account:
  
```powershell
$userName="belindan@contoso.com"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
if ($role -eq $null) {
$roleTemplate = Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleTemplate | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
Enable-AzureADDirectoryRole -RoleTemplateId $roleTemplate.ObjectId
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
}
Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userName}).ObjectID
```

To display the list of user names for a specific role, use these commands.

```powershell
$roleName="<role name>"
Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $roleName } | Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember | Ft DisplayName
```

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell) using a global administrator account.
  
### For a single role change

The most common ways of specific user account is with its display name or its email name, also known its sign-in name or user principal name (UPN).

#### Display names of user accounts

If you are used to working with the display names of user accounts, determine the following:
  
- The user account that you want to configure.
    
    To specify the user account, you must determine its Display Name. To get a complete list accounts, use this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolUser -All | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName | More
  ```

    This command lists the Display Name of your user accounts, sorted by the Display Name, one screen at a time. You can filter the list to a smaller set by using the **Where** cmdlet. Here is an example:

   >[!Note]
   >PowerShell Core does not support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with **Msol** in their name. To continue using these cmdlets, you must run them from Windows PowerShell.
   >
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -like "John*" | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName | More
  ```

    This command lists only the user accounts for which the Display Name starts with "John".
    
- The role you want to assign.
    
    To display the list of available roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
  ```

Once you have determined the Display Name of the account and the Name of the role, use these commands to assign the role to the account:
  
```powershell
$dispName="<The Display Name of the account>"
$roleName="<The role name you want to assign to the account>"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -eq $dispName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $roleName
```

Copy the commands and paste them into Notepad. For the **$dispName** and **$roleName** variables, replace the description text with their values, remove the \< and > characters, and leave the quotes. Copy the modified lines and paste them into your Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell window to run them. Alternately, you can use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Script Environment (ISE).
  
Here is an example of a completed command set:
  
```powershell
$dispName="Scott Wallace"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -eq $dispName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $roleName
```

#### Sign-in names of user accounts

If you are used to working with the sign-in names or UPNs of user accounts, determine the following:
  
- The user account's UPN.
    
    If you don't already know the UPN, use this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolUser -All | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
  ```

    This command lists the UPN of your user accounts, sorted by the UPN, one screen at a time. You can filter the list to a smaller set by using the **Where** cmdlet. Here is an example:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -like "John*" | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
  ```

    This command lists only the user accounts for which the Display Name starts with "John".
    
- The role you want to assign.
    
    To display the list of available roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
  ```

Once you have the UPN of the account and the name of the role, use these commands to assign the role to the account:
  
```powershell
$upnName="<The UPN of the account>"
$roleName="<The role name you want to assign to the account>"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $upnName -RoleName $roleName
```

Copy the commands and paste them into Notepad. For the **$upnName** and **$roleName** variables, replace the description text with their values, remove the \< and > characters, and leave the quotes. Copy the modified lines and paste them into your Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell window to run them. Alternately, you can use the Windows PowerShell ISE.
  
Here is an example of a completed command set:
  
```powershell
$upnName="scottw@contoso.com"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $upnName -RoleName $roleName
```

### Multiple role changes

For multiple role changes, determine the following:
  
- Which user accounts that you want to configure. You can use the methods in the previous section to gather the set of display names or UPNs.
    
- Which roles you want to assign to each user account.
    
    To display the list of available roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
    
  ```powershell
  Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
  ```

Next, create a comma-separated value (CSV) text file that has the display name or UPN and role name fields. You can do this easily with Microsoft Excel.

Here is an example for display names:
  
```powershell
DisplayName,RoleName
"Belinda Newman","Billing Administrator"
"Scott Wallace","SharePoint Service Administrator"
```

Next, fill in the location of the CSV file and run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.
  
```powershell
$fileName="<path and file name of the input CSV file that has the role changes, example: C:\admin\RoleUpdates.CSV>"
$roleChanges=Import-Csv $fileName | ForEach {Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser | Where DisplayName -eq $_.DisplayName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $_.RoleName }

```

Here is an example for UPNs:
  
```powershell
UserPrincipalName,RoleName
"belindan@contoso.com","Billing Administrator"
"scottw@contoso.com","SharePoint Service Administrator"
```

Next, fill in the location of the CSV file and run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.
  
```powershell
$fileName="<path and file name of the input CSV file that has the role changes, example: C:\admin\RoleUpdates.CSV>"
$roleChanges=Import-Csv $fileName | ForEach { Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $_.UserPrincipalName -RoleName $_.RoleName }

```
