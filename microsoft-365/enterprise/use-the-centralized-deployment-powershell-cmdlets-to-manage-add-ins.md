# Use the Centralized Deployment PowerShell cmdlets to manage add-ins

As a Microsoft 365 global admin, you can deploy Office add-ins to users via the Centralized Deployment feature (see [Deploy Office Add-ins in the admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins)). In addition to deploying Office add-ins via the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can also use Microsoft PowerShell. Install the [O365 Centralized Add-In Deployment Module for Windows PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/O365CentralizedAddInDeployment). 

After you download the module, open a regular Windows PowerShell window and run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
 Import-Module -Name O365CentralizedAddInDeployment
```
    
## Connect using your admin credentials

Before you can use the Centralized Deployment cmdlets, you need to sign in.
  
1. Start PowerShell.
    
2. Connect to PowerShell by using your company admin credentials. Run the following cmdlet.
    
  ```powershell
  Connect-OrganizationAddInService
  ```

3. In the **Enter Credentials** page, enter your Microsoft 365 global admin credentials. Alternately, you can enter your credentials directly into the cmdlet. 
    
    Run the following cmdlet specifying your company admin credentials as a PSCredential object.
    
  ```powershell
  $secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "MyPassword" -AsPlainText -Force
  $mycredentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("serviceaccount@contoso.com", $secpasswd)
  Connect-OrganizationAddInService -Credential $mycredentials
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about using PowerShell, see [Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848585). 
  
## Upload an add-in manifest

Run the **New-OrganizationAdd-In** cmdlet to upload an add-in manifest from a path, which can be either a file location or URL. The following example shows a file location for the value of the  _ManifestPath_ parameter. 
  
```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US'
```

You can also run the **New-OrganizationAdd-In** cmdlet to upload an add-in and assign it to users or groups directly by using the  _Members_ parameter, as shown in the following example. Separate the email addresses of members with a comma. 
  
```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US' -Members  'KathyBonner@contoso.com', 'MaxHargrave@contoso.com'
```

## Upload an add-in from the Office Store

Run the **New-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet to upload a manifest from the Office Store.
  
In the following example, the **New-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet specifies the AssetId for an add-in for a United States location and content market.
  
```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -AssetId 'WA104099688' -Locale 'en-US' -ContentMarket 'en-US'
```

To determine the value for the  _AssetId_ parameter, you can copy it from the URL of the Office Store webpage for the add-in. AssetIds always begin with "WA" followed by a number. For example, in the previous example, the source for the AssetId value of WA104099688 is the Office Store webpage URL for the add-in: [https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA104099688](https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA104099688).
  
The values for the  _Locale_ parameter and the  _ContentMarket_ parameter are identical and indicate the country/region you're trying to install the add-in from. The format is en-US, fr-FR. and so forth. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins uploaded from the Office Store will update automatically within a few days of the latest update being available on the Office Store. 
  
## Get details of an add-in

Run the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet as shown below to get details of all add-ins uploaded to the tenant, included an add-in's product ID.
  
```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddIn
```

Run the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with a value for the  _ProductId_ parameter to specify which add-in you want to retrieve details for. 
  
```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122
```

To get full details of all the add-ins plus the assigned users and groups, pipe the output of the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet to the Format-List cmdlet, as shown in the following example.
  
```powershell
foreach($G in (Get-organizationAddIn)){Get-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId $G.ProductId | Format-List}
```

## Turn on or turn off an add-in

To turn off an add-in so users and groups that are assigned to it will no longer have access, run the **Set-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the  _ProductId_ parameter and the  _Enabled_ parameter set to  `$false`, as shown in the following example.
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Enabled $false
```

To turn an add-in back on, run the same cmdlet with the  _Enabled_ parameter set to  `$true`.
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Enabled $true
```

## Add or remove users from an add-in

To add users and groups to a specific add-in, run the **Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments** cmdlet with the  _ProductId_,  _Add_, and  _Members_ parameters. Separate the email addresses of members with a comma. 
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Add -Members 'KathyBonner@contoso.com','sales@contoso.com'
```

To remove users and groups, run the same cmdlet using the  _Remove_ parameter. 
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Remove -Members 'KathyBonner@contoso.com','sales@contoso.com'
```

To assign an add-in to all users on the tenant, run the same cmdlet using the  _AssignToEveryone_ parameter with the value set to  `$true`.
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -AssignToEveryone $true
```

To not assign an add-in to everyone and revert to the previously assigned users and groups, you can run the same cmdlet and turn off the  _AssignToEveryone_ parameter by setting its value to  `$false`.
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -AssignToEveryone $false
```

## Update an add-in

To update an add-in from a manifest, run the **Set-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the  _ProductId_,  _ManifestPath_, and  _Locale_ parameters, as shown in the following example. 
  
```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins uploaded from the Office Store will update automatically within a few days of the latest update being available on the Office Store. 
  
## Delete an add-in

To delete an add-in, run the **Remove-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the  _ProductId_ parameter, as shown in the following example. 
  
```powershell
Remove-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122
```

## Customize Microsoft Store add-ins for your organization

You must customize the add-in before you deploy it to your organization. Add-ins older than version 1.1 are not supported by this feature. 

We recommend that you deploy a customized add-in  to yourself first to make sure it works as expected before you deploy it to your entire organization.

Note also the following restrictions:
- All URLs must be absolute (include http or https) and valid.
- *DisplayName* must not exceed 125 characters 
- *DisplayName*, *Resources* and *AppDomains* must not include the following characters: 
 
    - \<
    -  \>
    -  ;
    -  =   

If you want to customize an add-in that has been deployed, you have to uninstall it in the admin center, and see [remove an add-in from local cache](#remove-an-add-in-from-local-cache) for steps to remove it from each computer it has been deployed to.

To customize an add-in, run the **Set –OrganizationAddInOverrides** cmdlet with the *ProductId* as a parameter, followed by the tag you want to overwrite and the new value. To find out how to get the *ProductId* see [get details of an add-in](#get-details-of-an-add-in) in this article. For example:

```powershell
 Set-OrganizationAddInOverrides -ProductId 5b31b349-2c41-4f94-b720-6ee40349d391 -IconUrl "https://site.com/img.jpg" 
```
To customize multiple tags for an add-in, add those tags to the commandline:

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInOverrides -ProductId 5b31b349-2c41-4f94-b720-6ee40349d391 -Hosts h1, 2 -DisplayName "New DocuSign W" -IconUrl "https://site.com/img.jpg" 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must apply multiple customized tags to one add-in as one command. If you customize tags one by one, only the last customization will be applied. Additionally, if you customize a tag by mistake, you must remove all customizations and start over.

### Tags you can customize

| Tag                  | Description          |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| \<IconURL>   </br>| The URL of the image used as the add-in’s icon (in admin center). </br> |
| \<DisplayName>| The title of the add-in  (in admin center).|
| \<Hosts>| List of apps that will support the add-in.|
| \<SourceLocation> | The source URL that the add-in will connect to.| 
| \<AppDomains> | A list of domains that the add-in can connect with. | 
| \<SupportURL>| The URL users can use to access help and support. | 
| \<Resources>  | This tag contains a number of elements including titles, tooltips, and icons of different sizes.| 
|
### Customize Resources tag

Any element in the <Resources> tag of the manifest can be customized dynamically. You first need to check the manifest to find the element id to which you want to assign a new value. The <Resources> tag looks like this:

```
<Resources>  
    <bt:Images> 
          <bt:Image id=”img16icon” DefaultValue=”https://site.com/img.jpg” 
    </bt:Images> 
</Resources> 
``` 
In this case, the element id for the image is “img16icon” and the value associated with it is “http:<i></i>//site.<i></i>com/img.jpg.”

Once you have identified the elements you want to customize, use the following command in Powershell to assign new values to the elements:

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInOverrides -Resources @{“ElementID” = “New Value”; “NextElementID” = “Next New Value”} 
```

You can customize as many elements with the command as you need to.

### Remove customization from an add-in

The only option currently available for deleting customizations is to delete all of them at once:

```powershell
Remove-OrganizationAddInOverrides -ProductId 5b31b349-2c41-4f94-b720-6ee40349d391 
```

### View add-in customizations

To view a list of applied customizations, run the **Get-OrganizationAddInOverrides** cmdlet. If **Get-OrganizationAddInOverrides** is run without a *ProductId* then a list of all add-ins with applied overrides are returned.  

```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddInOverrides 
```
If ProductId is specified, then a list of overrides applied to that add-in is returned. 

```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddInOverrides -ProductId 5b31b349-2c41-4f94-b720-6ee40349d391 
```

### Remove an add-in from local cache

If an add-in has been deployed, it has to be removed from the cache in each computer before it can be customized. To remive an add-in from cache:

1. Navigate to the “Users” folder in C:\ 
1. Go to your user folder
1. Navigate to AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office and select the folder associated with your version of Office
1. In the *Wef* folder delete the *Manifests* folder.
