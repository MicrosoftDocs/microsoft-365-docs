# Identity and device access prerequisites for cloud only in your Microsoft 365 test environment

*This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environments.*

[Identity and device access configurations](../security/office-365-security/microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) are a set of recommended configurations and conditional access policies to protect access to all services that are integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

This article describes how to configure a Microsoft 365 test environment that meets the requirements of the [cloud only prerequisite configuration](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites) for identity and device access.

There are eight phases to setting up this test environment:

1. Build out your lightweight test environment
2. Configure named locations
3. Configure self-service password reset
4. Configure multifactor authentication
5. Enable automatic device registration of domain-joined Windows computers
6. Configure Azure AD password protection 
7. Enable Azure AD Identity Protection
8. Enable modern authentication for Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online

## Phase 1: Build out your lightweight Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in [Lightweight base configuration](lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md).
Here is the resulting configuration.

## Phase 2: Configure named locations

First, determine the public IP addresses or address ranges used by your organization.

Next, follow the instructions in [Configure named locations in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations) to add the addresses or address ranges as named locations. 

## Phase 3: Configure self-service password reset

Follow the instructions in [Phase 3 of the password reset Test Lab Guide](password-reset-m365-ent-test-environment.md#phase-3-configure-and-test-password-reset). 

When enabling password reset for the accounts in a specific Azure AD group, add these accounts to the **Password reset** group:

- User 2
- User 3
- User 4
- User 5

Test password reset only for the User 2 account.

## Phase 4: Configure multi-factor authentication

Follow the instructions in [Phase 2 of the multi-factor authentication Test Lab Guide](multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365-test-environment.md#phase-2-enable-and-test-multi-factor-authentication-for-the-user-2-account) for the following user accounts:

- User 2
- User 3
- User 4
- User 5

Test multi-factor authentication only for the User 2 account.

## Phase 5: Enable automatic device registration of domain-joined Windows computers 

Follow [these instructions](/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-plan) to enable automatic device registration of domain-joined Windows computers.

## Phase 6: Configure Azure AD password protection 

Follow [these instructions](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad) to block known weak passwords and their variants.

## Phase 7: Enable Azure AD Identity Protection

Follow the instructions in [Phase 2 of the Azure AD Identity Protection Test Lab Guide](azure-ad-identity-protection-microsoft-365-test-environment.md#phase-2-use-azure-ad-identity-protection). 

## Phase 8: Enable modern authentication for Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online

For Exchange Online, follow [these instructions](/Exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online#enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online-for-client-connections-in-outlook-2013-or-later). 

For Skype for Business Online:

1. Connect to [Skype for Business Online](/SkypeForBusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell).

2. Run this command.

  ```powershell
  Set-CsOAuthConfiguration -ClientAdalAuthOverride Allowed
  ```

3. Verify that the change was successful with this command.

  ```powershell
  Get-CsOAuthConfiguration
  ```

The result is a test environment that meets the requirements of the [cloud-only prerequisite configuration](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites) for identity and device access. 

## Next step

Use [Common identity and device access policies](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md) to configure the policies that build on the prerequisites and protect identities and devices.
