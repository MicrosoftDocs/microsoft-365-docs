# Step 3: Upload your binaries, dependencies, and scripts

On this tab, you will upload a single zip package containing your binaries, dependencies and scripts used to run your test suite.

> [!NOTE]
> The size of the zip package should be between a minimum of 10 MB and a maximum of 2 GB.

## Upload package zip file

  - Uploaded dependencies can include test frameworks, scripting engines or data that will be accessed to run your application or test cases. For example, you can upload Selenium and a web driver installer to help run browser-based tests.
  - It is best practice to ensure your script activities are kept modular i.e. 
    - The `Install` script only performs install operations.
    - The `Launch` script only launches the application.
    - The `Close` script only closes the application.
    - The optional `Uninstall` script only uninstalls the application.

**Currently, the portal only supports PowerShell scripts.**
