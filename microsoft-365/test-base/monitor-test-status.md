# Monitoring Test Status

[!INCLUDE [test-base-deprecation](./includes/test-base-deprecation.md)]

Test run status in the Test Base portal keeps you informed of where your package is in the testing process. You can see status in the **Test summary** page in addition to the **Details** pane.

This status provides details about test execution. If failures were detected during test execution, you'll find additional status and guidance information on the **Test Analysis** tab.

Current possible execution status values are described in the table that follows:

## Table 2. Test Execution status

| Status | Meaning |
|----|----|
|**Completed**|Test run and data processing are completed. Results are available.|
|**Processing**|Test execution is complete. Data is processing and results will be available soon.|
|**Test Execution in Progress**|Test execution is in progress.|
|**Test Failure**|Test run and data processing are complete. Your full test result details are available to view and there's a failure that requires your attention.|
|**Infrastructure Failure**|There's a failure in our infrastructure. The issue will be investigated and require no further action from you.|
