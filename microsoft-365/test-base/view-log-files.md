# Viewing Log Files

You can download public facing log files separately as an aid to troubleshooting script failures, regressions, reliability issues, or other unexpected results. Each test run that completes successfully should generate a collection of logs and data files that include .log, .etl, .csv, and .evtx files that are distributed in the following categories:

- Script installation and status logs
- Stderr & Stdout data
- Performance counter logs
- Exit codes
- System info
- Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)-generated traces
- CPU and memory usage data
- Event logs

To view such logs and/or data files, do the following:

- Click the **Log files: Download** link in the upper-left sector of the test results UI shown in the previous figure for a specified release.
- Click **Download** in the **Log File Download** pane that displays.
- Click **Open file** in the **Downloads** pane in the right-hand sector of the UI to open the **logs.zip** file containing all the log data output generated by test execution.

Also, if you click **Security update results** or **Feature update results** in the **Insights** category on the left-hand side menu in the UI, you will see a **Download** link in the **Log files** column for both **Functional test** and **Out of box test**. Click either link to view the logs for either category of tests.
