# What is Test Base for Microsoft 365? 

Test Base for Microsoft 365 (Test Base) is Microsoft’s validation service based in the secure Azure environment.  
With Test Base, Software Vendors (SVs) and System Integrators (SIs) can accelerate the validation of their applications against pre-released Windows security and feature builds. This is a highly engaged collaboration between SV partners and Microsoft enabling joint testing, validation and remediation.

Test Base provides a great opportunity to build and maintain a secure validation service on Azure, where customers and partners can stage and test their application's workloads against our pre-released security updates.

With Test Base, SVs are provided with more visibility into potential issues that could hinder their application(s) from performing at its best on the new OS release before Microsoft releases the update to the market.

This new service will help SVs make testing efforts simpler and more efficient. Enterprise customers will benefit from SV and Microsoft testing together in a collaborative environment and gain more confidence that their applications will work as expected. 

### Advantages Test Base offers Eenterprises and their SV partners include: 
 
  *	Faster rollout of security updates to secure your devices; 
 
  *	Lowered update validation costs by hosting the OS changes and application in the same environment; 
  
  *	World-class intelligence report from Microsoft about your apps (code coverage, API impact analysis etc.); 
  
  *	Microsoft's expertise in shifting test content and harnesses to Azure. 


### Guide to navigating the Test Base portal

This guide is divided into four (4) parts to ensure a hitch free experience while using our service:

1. The **Overview** which provides detailed, step-by-step guidelines on how to upload your application via our self-serve onboarding portal. 

2. The **Quickstarts** section which provides information on the format for the zippped folder structure and what you need to know when preparing your test scripts.

3. The **How-to guide** which provides detailed outline on how to use Test Base to infer test results.

4. The **Reference** section that provides answers to the typical questions we receive from our customers.

### Test Base is in public preview!

Test Base has officially been declared ```Public Preview``` during the Microsoft Inspire conference in July 2021. 

This means anyone with a valid enterprise Azure account is able to onboard their test collateral and quickly start testing their applications on the service.

### Who should onboard?

We are encouraging all Software Vendors (SVs), System Integrators (SIs) to onboard their applications, binaries and test scripts onto the service.
