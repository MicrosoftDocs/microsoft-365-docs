# Set up Microsoft 365

This article describes the process of setting up Microsoft 365. Anybody with Microsoft 365 Business Premium can use this guidance to step up security.

## Admins: Set up Microsoft 365

The following diagram describes how admins set up Microsoft 365.

![Steps to set up Microsoft 365](../media/M365-democracy-SetUpProcess.png)

For campaigns that qualify for special pricing, get started by [requesting an invite from Microsoft](https://m365forcampaigns.microsoft.com/), then [signing up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md). To complete setup, [run the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

For all other organizations, after you've [signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../business/sign-up.md), complete setup by [running the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

For all organizations, bump up security protection by: [protecting admin accounts](m365-campaigns-protect-admin-accounts.md), [protecting access to mail and data](m365-campaigns-conditional-access.md), and [increasing threat protection](m365-campaigns-increase-protection.md).

## Everyone: Set up your devices

Users will need to take a few minutes to set up devices to work with this environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them to get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.

![User device setup process](../media/m365-democracy-user-device-setup.png)
  
To set up user devices:

1. Each user [sets up their mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json).
2. For unmanaged devices, users set up their [PCs and Macs](m365-campaigns-protect-pcs-macs.md).
For key staff, we recommend that you use [managed devices](../business/set-up-windows-devices.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) for even better protection. For all devices, you'll want to set up [multifactor authentication](m365-campaigns-multifactor-authenication.md).
3. All users should learn how to protect themselves and your campaign by learning about [phishing and other attacks](m365-campaigns-phishing-and-attacks.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your campaign from online threats.
