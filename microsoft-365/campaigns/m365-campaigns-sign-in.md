# Sign in to Microsoft 365

## For business or campaign admins

If you signed up for Microsoft 365, you're the Microsoft 365 admin. Here's how to sign in:

1. Find the username and password that we sent to the email address that you gave us in step 2 of [Steps to sign up](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md#steps-to-sign-up).
2. In the browser, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
3. Type in your username and password. Select **Sign in**.
4. In the top right of the page, find the **Preview on** control. Select **Preview on** so you can use all the controls described in [Bump up protection for your campaign](m365-campaigns-security-overview.md).

## For staff

Set up staff as described in [Add users](../admin/add-users/add-users.md?toc=%2fmicrosoft-365%2fcampaigns%2ftoc.json)
You can also reset and resend passwords on the **Add users** page.
All staff can sign in at <a href="https://office.com" target="_blank">https://Office.com</a>.
