# Set up multifactor authentication

Multi-factor authentication provides more security for your business. After your admin has required you to use MFA, you can set up the Microsoft Authenticator app to let you log into key apps securely with your phone.

## Use the Outlook app in your devices

After your admin has required you to use MFA and you've set up an authenticator app as a second form of authentication, we recommend that you install and only use the Outlook app to access your Microsoft 365 email. See [Set up mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md) for how to install Office apps, including Outlook, on your phone.
