# Customize your sign-in page with a privacy and consent notice

Your business or campaign can make it easier for law enforcement agencies to file legal charges against online criminals by adding a privacy and consent notice to your sign-in page.

You can customize your sign-in page with your branding. You can also add text to help your users sign in, or to point out legal requirements or restrictions for getting access to Microsoft 365 resources.

## Design customization the text on your sign-in page

To update the customizable elements on the sign-in page, you have to be a global admin. For specific instructions, see [add company branding](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding) article.

The elements you can update are:

- **Sign-in page text**
     An easy place to add the privacy and consent statement.
- Sign-in page background image
- Banner logo
- Username hint

For examples of privacy and consent notices, see Appendix A in [Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf).
