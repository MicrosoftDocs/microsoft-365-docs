# Allow members to send as or send on behalf of a group

A member of a Microsoft 365 group who has been granted **Send as** or **Send on behalf** permissions can send email as the group, or on behalf of the group. (Guests in the group cannot be granted these permissions.)

This article explains how a global or Exchange administrator can set these permissions.
  
For example, if Megan Bowen is part of the **Training** Microsoft 365 group, and has **Send as** permissions on the group, if she sends an email as the group, it will look like the **Training** group sent the email. 
  
The **Send on Behalf** permission lets a user send email on behalf of a Microsoft 365 group. For example, if Alex Wilber is a part of the **Marketing** Microsoft 365 group, and has **Send on Behalf** permissions and sends an email as the group, the email looks like it was sent by **Alex Wilber on behalf of Marketing**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can configure **Send as** or **Send on behalf** for a given user, but not both. If you configure both, it will default to **Send as**.

> [!TIP]
> See [Send email from or on behalf of a Microsoft 365 group](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0f4964af-aec6-484b-a65c-0434df8cdb6b) to learn how to use Outlook and Outlook on the Web to send email from a group.
