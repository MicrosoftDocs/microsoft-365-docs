# Require conditional access for people outside your organization

You can require any of the following conditional access options for people outside your organization:

- Multifactor authentication
- Compliant devices
- Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices

When using Microsoft Entra B2B direct connect - such as with shared channels in Teams - you can choose to trust the conditional access settings from other organizations for these options. Note that the conditional access policies are only used for access to the Files tab in the shared channel and the associated SharePoint site.

## Planning considerations for conditional access

Multifactor authentication can be used with any external account. If your organization doesn't trust multifactor authentication from other Microsoft Entra organizations, users from those organizations must perform multifactor authentication when accessing resources in your organization. People with email addresses not hosted by Microsoft are always prompted for multifactor authentication.

The options **Trust compliant devices** and **Trust Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device** require devices that are managed in Microsoft Entra ID. If you choose to enable these options, people outside your organization must be using devices that are managed by your organization or by an organization that you trust. People without managed devices will be blocked, including:

- People with email addresses not hosted by Microsoft, including consumer email addresses
- People from Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra organizations that don't manage devices
- People from Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra organizations that require managed devices where your organization doesn't trust their conditional access settings.

We recommend using caution when requiring compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices because this blocks many external collaboration scenarios. Be sure all of your partner organizations manage their devices and that your organization trusts their settings.

## Set up conditional access requirements for people outside your organization

To require conditional access for people outside your organization, do the following:

1. [Choose conditional access settings to trust from other organizations](#choose-conditional-access-settings-to-trust-from-other-organizations).

## Choose conditional access settings to trust from other organizations

You can choose to trust conditional access settings from all other Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra organizations or only from those you specify.
