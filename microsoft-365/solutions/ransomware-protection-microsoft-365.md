# Deploy ransomware protection for your Microsoft 365 tenant

Ransomware is a type of extortion attack that destroys or encrypts files and folders, preventing access to critical data. Commodity ransomware typically spreads like a virus that infects devices and only requires malware remediation. Human-operated ransomware is the result of an active attack by cybercriminals that infiltrate an organization’s on-premises or cloud IT infrastructure, elevate their privileges, and deploy ransomware to critical data.

Once the attack is complete, an attacker demands money from victims in exchange for the deleted files, decryption keys for encrypted files, or a promise not to release sensitive data to the dark web or the public internet. Human-operated ransomware can also be used to shut down critical machines or processes, such as those needed for industrial production, bringing normal business operations to a halt until the ransom is paid and the damage is corrected, or the organization remediates the damage themselves.

A human-operated ransomware attack can be catastrophic to businesses of all sizes and is difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity ransomware, human-operated ransomware can continue to threaten businesses operations after the initial ransom request.

>[!Note]
>A ransomware attack on a Microsoft 365 tenant assumes that the attacker has valid user account credentials for a tenant and has access to all of the files and resources that are permitted to the user account. An attacker without any valid user account credentials would have to decrypt the data at rest that has been encrypted by Microsoft 365 default and enhanced encryption. For more information, see [Encryption and key management overview](/compliance/assurance/assurance-encryption).

## Security in the cloud is a partnership

The security of your Microsoft cloud services is a partnership between you and Microsoft:

- Microsoft cloud services are built on a foundation of trust and security. Microsoft provides you with security controls and capabilities to help you protect your data and applications.
- You own your data and identities and the responsibility for protecting them, the security of your on-premises resources, and the security of cloud components you control.

By combining these capabilities and responsibilities, we can provide the best protection against a ransomware attack.

## Ransomware mitigation and recovery capabilities provided with Microsoft 365

A ransomware attacker that has infiltrated a Microsoft 365 tenant can hold your organization for ransom by:

- Deleting files or email
- Encrypting files in place
- Copying files outside your tenant (data exfiltration)

However, Microsoft 365 online services have many built in capabilities and controls to protect customer data from ransomware attacks. The following sections provide a summary. For more details about how Microsoft protects customer data, [Malware and ransomware protection in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-malware-and-ransomware-protection).

### Deleting files or email

Files in SharePoint and OneDrive for Business are protected by:

- Versioning 

   Microsoft 365 retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default and can be configured to retain more. 

   To minimize the burden on your security and helpdesk staff, train your users on how to [restore previous versions of files](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-a-previous-version-of-an-item-or-file-in-sharepoint-f66dbda0-81f4-4d1e-b08c-793265c58934).

- Recycle bin

   If the ransomware creates a new encrypted copy of the file and deletes the old file, customers have 93 days to restore it from the recycle bin. After 93 days, there is a 14-day window where Microsoft can still recover the data. 
  
   To minimize the burden on your security and helpdesk staff, train your users on how to [restore files from the recycle bin](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-deleted-items-from-the-site-collection-recycle-bin-5fa924ee-16d7-487b-9a0a-021b9062d14b).

- [Files Restore](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15)

   A complete self-service recovery solution for SharePoint and OneDrive that allows administrators and end users to restore files from any point in time during the last 30 days.

   To minimize the burden on your security and IT helpdesk staff, train your users on [Files Restore](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15).


For OneDrive and SharePoint files, Microsoft can roll back to a previous point in time for up to 14 days if you are hit by a mass attack.

Email is protected by:

- [Single item recovery](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/enable-or-disable-single-item-recovery) and mailbox retention, in which you can recover items in a mailbox upon inadvertent or malicious premature deletion. You can rollback mail messages deleted within 14 days by default, configurable up to 30 days.

- [Retention policies](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/retention-tags-and-policies) allow you to retain immutable copies of email for the configured retention period.

### Encrypting files in place

As previously described, files in SharePoint and OneDrive for Business are protected from malicious encryption with:

- Versioning
- Recycle bin
- Preservation Hold library

For additional details, see [Dealing with data corruption in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-dealing-with-data-corruption).

### Copying files outside your tenant 

You can prevent a ransomware attacker from copying files outside your tenant with:

- [Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp) policies

    Detect, warn, and block risky, inadvertent, or inappropriate sharing of data containing:

    - Personal information such as personally identifying information (PII) for compliance with regional privacy regulations.

    - Confidential organization information based on sensitivity labels.

- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)

    Block downloads of sensitive information such as files. 

    You can also use session policies for [Defender for Cloud Apps Conditional Access App Control](/cloud-app-security/tutorial-dlp#how-to-discover-and-protect-sensitive-information-in-your-organization) to monitor the flow of information between a user and an application in real time.

## What’s in this solution

This solution steps you through the deployment of Microsoft 365 protection and mitigation features, configurations, and ongoing operations to minimize the ability of a ransomware attacker to use the critical data in your Microsoft 365 tenant and hold your organization for ransom.

![The steps to protecting against ransomware with Microsoft 365](../media/ransomware-protection-microsoft-365/ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-step-grid.png)

The steps in this solution are:

1. [Configure security baselines](ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-security-baselines.md)
2. [Deploy attack detection and response](ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-attack-detection-response.md)
3. [Protect identities](ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-identities.md)
4. [Protect devices](ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-devices.md)
5. [Protect information](ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-information.md)

Here are the five steps of the solution deployed for your Microsoft 365 tenant.

![Ransomware protection for a Microsoft 365 tenant](../media/ransomware-protection-microsoft-365/ransomware-protection-microsoft-365-architecture.png)

This solution uses the principles of [Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/): 

- **Verify explicitly:** Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- **Use least privilege access:** Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- **Assume breach:** Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

Unlike conventional intranet access, which trusts everything behind an organization's firewall, Zero Trust treats each sign-in and access as though it originated from an uncontrolled network, whether it's behind the organization firewall or on the Internet. Zero Trust requires protection for the network, infrastructure, identities, endpoints, apps, and data.

## Impact on users and change management

Deploying additional security features and implementing requirements and security policies for your Microsoft 365 tenant can impact your users. 

For example, you may impose a new security policy that requires users to create new teams for specific uses with a list of user accounts as members, instead of more easily creating a team for all users in the organization. This can help prevent a ransomware attacker from exploring teams that are not available to the attacker's compromised user account and targeting the resources of that team in the subsequent attack.

This foundation solution will identify when new configurations or recommended security policies can impact your users so you can perform the required change management.
