# Key compliance and security considerations for US banking and capital markets

## Introduction
Financial services institutions surpass nearly all commercial businesses in their demand for stringent security, compliance, and governance controls. The protection of data, identities, devices, and applications is not only critical to their business, it is subject to compliance requirements and guidelines from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In addition, financial institutions are subject to laws such as Dodd-Frank and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Beyond this, in today's climate of increased security vigilance, insider risk concerns and public data breaches, customers demand higher levels of security from their financial institutions in order to trust them with their personal data and banking assets.
