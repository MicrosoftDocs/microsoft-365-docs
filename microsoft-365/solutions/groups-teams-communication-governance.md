# Communications governance for collaboration scenarios

Microsoft 365 offers a number of controls to help you govern communication in your organization, including messaging and meetings settings. Review these options and consider how they map to your business needs, the sensitivity of your data, and the scope of people that your users need to collaborate with.

The following table provides a quick reference for the communications controls available in Microsoft 365. Further information is provided in the following sections.

## Messaging

You can control which chat and channel messaging features - such as editing or deleting messages - are available to users in Microsoft Teams by using messaging policies. You can create different policies for different users and groups.

You can control who can start new posts and reply to posts in a Teams channel by configuring channel moderation.

[Set up and manage channel moderation in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-channel-moderation-in-teams)

## Meetings

You can control the features that are available to Teams meeting participants, including scheduling, content sharing, participants, and audio and video policies.

[Manage meeting policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-in-teams)

You can control anonymous join for Teams meetings which allows anyone with a link to the meeting to join.

[Allow anonymous users to join meetings](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams#allow-anonymous-users-to-join-meetings)


## Communication compliance

Communication compliance allows you to examine communications for offensive language, sensitive information, and information related to internal and regulatory standards. Chat communications, mailboxes, and Yammer messages can all be monitored, generating alerts. With administration tools, you can quickly identify and take action on messages with policy matches.
