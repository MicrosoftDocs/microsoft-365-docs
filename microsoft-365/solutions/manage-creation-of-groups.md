# Manage who can create Microsoft 365 Groups

By default, all users can create Microsoft 365 groups. This is the recommended approach because it allows users to start collaborating without requiring assistance from IT.

If your business requires that you restrict who can create groups, you can do so by following the procedures in this article. When you limit who can create a group, it affects all services that rely on groups for access, including:

- Outlook
    
- SharePoint
    
- Yammer
    
- Microsoft Teams

- Microsoft Stream

- Planner
    
- PowerBI (classic)
    
- Project for the web / Roadmap
    
You can restrict Microsoft 365 Group creation to the members of a particular security group. To configure this, you use Windows PowerShell. This article walks you through the needed steps.
  
The steps in this article won't prevent members of certain roles from creating Groups. Office 365 Global admins can create Groups via any means, such as the Microsoft 365 admin center, Planner, Teams, Exchange, and SharePoint Online. Other roles can create Groups via limited means, listed below.
        
  - Exchange Administrator: Exchange Admin center, Azure AD
    
  - Partner Tier 1 Support: Microsoft 365 Admin center, Exchange Admin center, Azure AD
    
  - Partner Tier 2 Support: Microsoft 365 Admin center, Exchange Admin center, Azure AD
    
  - Directory Writers: Azure AD

  - SharePoint Administrator: SharePoint Admin center, Azure AD
  
  - Teams Service Administrator: Teams Admin center, Azure AD
  
  - User Management Administrator: Microsoft 365 Admin center, Yammer, Azure AD
     
If you're a member of one of these roles, you can create Microsoft 365 Groups for restricted users, and then assign the user as the owner of the group.

## Licensing requirements

To manage who creates groups, the following people need Azure AD Premium licenses or Azure AD Basic EDU licenses assigned to them:

- The admin who configures these group creation settings
- The members of the security group who are allowed to create groups
 
> [!NOTE]
> See [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure Active Directory portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups) for more details about how to assign Azure licenses.

The following people don't need Azure AD Premium or Azure AD Basic EDU licenses assigned to them:

- People who are members of Microsoft 365 groups and who don't have the ability to create other groups.

## Step 1: Create a security group for users who need to create Microsoft 365 groups

Only one security group in your organization can be used to control who is able to create Groups. But, you can nest other security groups as members of this group.

Admins in the roles listed above do not need to be members of this group: they retain their ability to create groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to use a **security group** to restrict who can create groups. Using a Microsoft 365 group is not supported. 
    
1. In the admin center, go to the [Groups page](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/groups).

2. Click on **Add a Group**.

3. Choose **Security** as the group type. Remember the name of the group! You'll need it later.
  
4. Finish setting up the security group, adding people or other security groups who you want to be able to create groups in your org.
    
For detailed instructions, see [Create, edit, or delete a security group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group).
 
## Step 2: Run PowerShell commands

You must use the preview version of [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph (AzureAD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) (module name **AzureADPreview**) to change the group-level guest access setting:

- If you haven't installed any version of the Azure AD PowerShell module before, see [Installing the Azure AD Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0-preview#installing-the-azure-ad-module) and follow the instructions to install the public preview release.

- If you have the 2.0 general availability version of the Azure AD PowerShell module (AzureAD) installed, you must uninstall it by running `Uninstall-Module AzureAD` in your PowerShell session, and then install the preview version by running `Install-Module AzureADPreview`.

- If you have already installed the preview version, run `Install-Module AzureADPreview` to make sure it's the latest version of this module.

Copy the script below into a text editor, such as Notepad, or the [Windows PowerShell ISE](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/components/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise).

Replace *\<SecurityGroupName\>* with the name of the security group that you created. For example:

`$GroupName = "Group Creators"`

Save the file as GroupCreators.ps1. 

In the PowerShell window, navigate to the location where you saved the file (type "CD <FileLocation>").

Run the script by typing:

`.\GroupCreators.ps1`

and [sign in with your administrator account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell#step-2-connect-to-azure-ad-for-your-microsoft-365-subscription) when prompted.

```PowerShell
$GroupName = "<SecurityGroupName>"
$AllowGroupCreation = "False"

Connect-AzureAD

$settingsObjectID = (Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where-object -Property Displayname -Value "Group.Unified" -EQ).id
if(!$settingsObjectID)
{
	  $template = Get-AzureADDirectorySettingTemplate | Where-object {$_.displayname -eq "group.unified"}
    $settingsCopy = $template.CreateDirectorySetting()
    New-AzureADDirectorySetting -DirectorySetting $settingsCopy
    $settingsObjectID = (Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where-object -Property Displayname -Value "Group.Unified" -EQ).id
}

$settingsCopy = Get-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id $settingsObjectID
$settingsCopy["EnableGroupCreation"] = $AllowGroupCreation

if($GroupName)
{
	$settingsCopy["GroupCreationAllowedGroupId"] = (Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString $GroupName).objectid
}
 else {
$settingsCopy["GroupCreationAllowedGroupId"] = $GroupName
}
Set-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id $settingsObjectID -DirectorySetting $settingsCopy

(Get-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id $settingsObjectID).Values
```

The last line of the script will display the updated settings:

![This is what your settings will look like when you're done.](../media/952cd982-5139-4080-9add-24bafca0830c.png)

If in the future you want to change which security group is used, you can rerun the script with the name of the new security group.

If you want to turn off the group creation restriction and again allow all users to create groups, set $GroupName to "" and $AllowGroupCreation to "True" and rerun the script.
    
## Step 3: Verify that it works

Changes can take thirty minutes or more to take effect. You can verify the new settings by doing the following:

1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with a user account of someone who should NOT have the ability to create groups. That is, they are not a member of the security group you created or an administrator.
    
2. Select the **Planner** tile. 
    
3. In Planner, select **New Plan** in the left navigation to create a plan. 
  
4. You should get a message that plan and group creation is disabled.

Try the same procedure again with a member of the security group.

> [!NOTE]
> If members of the security group aren't able to create groups, check that they aren't being blocked through their [OWA mailbox policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=852135).
