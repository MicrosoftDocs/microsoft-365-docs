# Collaborate with external participants in a shared channel (IT Admins)

If you want to enable your users to collaborate with people in other Microsoft 365 organizations in [shared channels](/MicrosoftTeams/shared-channels), you need to configure B2B direct connect for each organization that you want to collaborate with. (Alternatively, you can [Enable shared channels with all external organizations](/microsoft-365/solutions/allow-direct-connect-with-all-organizations).)

When you enable shared channels in Teams with another organization:

- Team owners in your organization can invite people from other organizations to participate in shared channels.
- Your organization's custom (line of business) apps are available in shared channels and external participants can access them.
- Your organization's apps list is available in shared channels and external participants can access them.

## Prerequisites

Collaborating with external participants in a shared channel requires that guest access be turned on for SharePoint and Microsoft 365 Groups. These settings are enabled by default, but if your organization has made changes to them, confirm the following settings before configuring shared channels:

- [Microsoft 365 Groups sharing settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#microsoft-365-groups) must both be enabled.
- SharePoint [organization level](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#sharepoint-and-onedrive-organization-level) and [site level](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#sharepoint-site-level) sharing settings must allow guests. The domains you're sharing with must not be blocked.

> [!NOTE]
> Shared channels between Commercial and GCC clouds are not supported.

## Enable shared channels in Teams

Shared channels is enabled by default in Teams. Follow this procedure to confirm the settings.

To configure shared channels
1. In the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), expand **Teams**, and then select **Teams policies**.
1. Select the policy for which you want to enable shared channels, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select the options you want to enable:
    - To allow team owners to create shared channels, turn **Create shared channels** on.
    - To allow team owners to share shared channels with people outside the organization, turn **Invite external users to shared channels** on.
    - To allow users to be invited to shared channels in other organizations, turn **Join external shared channels** on.
1. Select **Apply**.

In order for external channel participants to participate in meetings, external access must be enabled. This is also required to be able to see external participants' presence in the channel.

To enable external access
1. In the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), expand **Users**, and then select **External access**.
1. Under **Teams and Skype for Business users in external organizations**, ensure that the organizations that you want to collaborate with are not blocked.

## Configure cross-tenant access settings in Azure AD

Azure AD B2B direct connect is disabled by default. To enable collaboration in shared channels with people from other organizations, you must:

1. [Add an organization](#add-an-organization).
1. [Configure inbound settings](#configure-inbound-settings) for the organization to allow users from the organization to be invited to your shared channels.
1. [Configure outbound settings](#configure-outbound-settings) for the organization to allow your users to be invited to the other organization's shared channels.

As part of this configuration, we enable the **Office 365** application, which includes Teams and Teams-integrated services such as SharePoint.

> Changes to cross-tenant access settings may take up to six hours to take effect.
