# Set up your infrastructure for hybrid work with Microsoft 365

To secure and optimize your worker’s productivity and collaboration, you need to allow on-site and remote workers to easily and securely access your organization's on-premises and cloud-based information, tools, and resources. This solution steps through the deployment of key layers of infrastructure that empower your workers to do their best work, wherever they are.

Hybrid workers can work on-site or remotely in a combination of locations. Allowing workers to work away from a traditional office is important for many organizations to:

- Hire and retain workers who are unwilling to relocate or require a flexible work environment.
- Reduce worker commuting, leaving workers with more time to be productive and for stress-reducing activities outside of work.
- Save on office space.

Microsoft 365 has the capabilities to empower your hybrid workers to work either on-site or remotely.

For IT professionals managing onsite and cloud-based infrastructure to enable hybrid worker productivity, this solution provides these key capabilities:

- Connected

  From anywhere in the world and at any time, your workers are able to access:

  - Cloud-based services and data in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

  - Organization resources, such those offered by on-premises application datacenters.

- Secure

  Sign-ins are secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and built-in security features of Microsoft 365 and Windows 10 protect against malware, malicious attacks, and data loss.

- Managed

  Your hybrid worker's devices can be managed from the cloud with security settings, allowed apps, and to require compliance with system health.

- Collaborative and productive

  Your hybrid workers can be as productive as on-premises in a highly collaborative way with:

  - Online meetings and chat sessions with Teams.

  - Shared workspaces for cloud-based file storage with global accessibility and real-time collaboration with SharePoint and OneDrive.

  - Shared tasks and workflows to divide up the work and get things done.

For a seamless sign-in experience, your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) user accounts should be synchronized with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). To protect your Windows 10 devices, they should be enrolled in Intune. Here is a high-level view of the infrastructure.

## Provide hybrid working for all of your workers

You can enable all of your workers to stay productive from anywhere with these devices:

- A modern device, such as a Surface laptop and Windows 10, which has the features, security, and performance to access Microsoft 365 cloud apps and services directly over the web.

- Any device including older laptops or desktops used from home, which can access Microsoft 365 cloud apps and services indirectly through a quickly deployed [Windows 10-based virtual desktop](empower-people-to-work-remotely-remote-access.md#deploy-windows-virtual-desktop-to-provide-remote-access-for-remote-workers-using-personal-devices). This option provides high performance, strong security, and simplified IT management.
