# Enable shared channels with all external organizations

While sharing shared channels externally is enabled by default in Teams, Azure Active Directory cross-tenant access settings for [B2B direct connect](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/b2b-direct-connect-overview) must also be configured to share a channel externally. By default, these settings are set to block all organizations.

You can change the B2B direct connect default settings to allow all organizations. This allows users to collaborate in shared channels without your organization having to create a separate configuration for each organization that you want to collaborate with. (Note that the organizations you collaborate with will also have to configure their B2B direct connect settings.)

If your organization doesn't have a requirement to restrict collaboration with other organizations, enabling all organizations by default can save you time and complexity in managing each organization separately.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to cross-tenant access settings may take two hours to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> [Guest settings for Microsoft 365 Groups](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups) must be enabled to use shared channels with external participants.

## Allow users to invite people in other organizations to participate in shared channels

You can allow your users to invite people from other organizations to use shared resources - such as shared channels in Teams - by default.
