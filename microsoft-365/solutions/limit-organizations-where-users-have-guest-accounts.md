# Limit organizations where users can have guest accounts

By default, other Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra organizations can invite your users to participate in their organization as guests. This includes inviting them to teams in Microsoft Teams, SharePoint sites, and sharing individual files and folders with them.

If you only want your users to participate as guests with specific organizations, you can specify these organizations in the Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings for [B2B collaboration](/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b).

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to cross-tenant access settings may take six hours to take effect.

## Set the default B2B collaboration settings to block users from being guests

Because participating as guests is enabled by default, limiting guest participation to certain organizations requires blocking outbound B2B collaboration by default.

To block outbound B2B collaboration by default
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) using a Global Administrator or Security Administrator account.
1. Expand **External Identities**, and then select **Cross-tenant access settings**.
1. Select the **Default settings** tab.
1. Under **Outbound access settings**, select **Edit outbound defaults**.
1. Select the **B2B collaboration** tab and the **Users and groups** tab.
1. Under **Access status**, choose **Block access**.
1. Select the **External applications** tab.
1. Under **Access status**, choose **Block access**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Close the **Default settings** blade.

## Add an organization

Next, add the organizations where you want to allow your users to collaborate as guests to the Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access list.

To add an organization
1. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), under **External Identities**, select **Cross-tenant access settings**.
1. Select **Organizational settings**.
1. Select **Add organization**.
1. On the **Add organization** pane, type the full domain name (or tenant ID) for the organization.
1. Select the organization in the search results, and then select **Add**.
1. The organization appears in the **Organizational settings** list.

At this point, all access settings for this organization are inherited from your default settings.

## Configure the organization's outbound setting to allow all users

Once you've added the organization, you need to update the organization's outbound settings to allow B2B collaboration users to be added as guests. Do this for each organization where you want to allow your users to be added as guests.

To allow users to B2B collaboration guests in an organization
1. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), under **External Identities**, select **Cross-tenant access settings**.
1. Select the outbound access link for the organization that you want to modify.
1. On the **B2B collaboration** tab, choose **Customize settings**.
1. On the **Users and groups** tab, under **Access status**, choose **Allow access**. Under **Applies to**, choose to allow all users.
1. On the **External applications** tab, under **Access status**, choose **Allow access**. Under **Applies to**, choose the applications that you want to allow.
1. Select **Save** and close the **Outbound access settings** blade.
