# Understand built-in apps for Intune

The [built-in app type](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-built-in) makes it easy for you to assign curated managed apps, such as Microsoft 365 apps and third-party apps, to iOS/iPadOS and Android devices. You can assign specific apps for this app type, such as Excel, OneDrive, Outlook, Skype, and others. After you add an app to Intune, the app type is displayed as either *Built-in iOS app* or *Built-in Android app*. By using the built-in app type, you can choose which of these apps to publish to device users.

When possible, instead of using store app types, we recommend that you use the built-in app type. By using the built-in app type, you have the additional flexibility to edit and delete Microsoft 365 apps.

## Apps that are built in

| App type | Description |
|---|---|
| Built-in iOS/iPadOS app | Built-in iOS/iPadOS apps are specific apps that have been designed to work with Microsoft Intune.   |
| Built-in Android app | Built-in Android apps are specific apps that have been designed to work with Microsoft Intune. |

*Built-in* apps can be added to Intune by selecting **Built-In app**.
