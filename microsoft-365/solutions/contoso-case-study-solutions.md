# Microsoft 365 solutions for the Contoso Corporation

The Contoso Corporation is a fictional but representative global manufacturing conglomerate with its headquarters in Paris, France. Contoso has deployed Microsoft 365 Enterprise and addressed major design decisions and implementation details for networking, identity, Windows 10 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, mobile device management, information protection, and security. 

The overall goal of Contoso for Microsoft 365 Enterprise is to accelerate their digital transformation by using cloud services to bring together its employees, partners, data, and processes to create customer value and maintain its competitive advantage in a digital-first world.
