## Building your monitoring and response strategy

Most data privacy regulations generally require the type of monitoring and response listed below:

- Auditing, alerting, and reporting for activities related to the storage, sharing, and processing of personal data.
- The ability to respond to subject requests and, in some cases, perform investigative and other administrative measures to comply with such requests.

Your organization may also wish to perform monitoring and response activities for other purposes, such as other compliance needs or for business reasons. Establishing your monitoring and response scheme for data privacy should be done as part of overall monitoring and response planning, implementation, and management.

Use the links above to explore how Purview capabilities can help you develop a monitoring and response scheme, and answer questions such as:

- What sort of day-to-day monitoring and investigative and reporting techniques are available for the different data types and sources?
- What mechanisms will be needed to handle subject rights requests and any remedial actions, such as anonymization, redaction, and deletion?
