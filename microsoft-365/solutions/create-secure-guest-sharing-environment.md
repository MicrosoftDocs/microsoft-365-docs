# Create a secure guest sharing environment

In this article, we'll walk through a variety of options for creating a secure guest sharing environment in Microsoft 365. These are examples to give you an idea of the options available. You can use these procedures in different combinations to meet the security and compliance needs of your organization.

This article includes:

- Setting up multi-factor authentication for guests.
- Setting up a terms of use for guests.
- Setting up quarterly guest access reviews to periodically validate whether guests continue to need permissions to teams and sites.
- Restricting guests to web-only access for unmanaged devices.
- Configuring a session timeout policy to ensure guests authenticate daily.
- Creating a sensitive information type for a highly sensitive project.
- Automatically assigning a sensitivity label to documents that contain a sensitive information type.
- Automatically removing guest access from files with a sensitivity label.

Some of the options discussed in this article require guests to have an account in Azure Active Directory. To ensure that guests are included in the directory when you share files and folders with them, use the [SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B Preview](/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration-preview).

Note that we won't discuss enabling guest sharing settings in this article. See [Collaborating with people outside your organization](collaborate-with-people-outside-your-organization.md) for details about enabling guest sharing for different scenarios.

## Set up multi-factor authentication for guests

Multi-factor authentication greatly reduces the chances of an account being compromised. Since guests may be using personal email accounts that don't adhere to any governance policies or best practices, it's especially important to require multi-factor authentication for guests. If a guest's username and password is stolen, requiring a second factor of authentication greatly reduces the chances of unknown parties gaining access to your sites and files.

In this example, we'll set up multi-factor authentication for guests by using a conditional access policy in Azure Active Directory.

To set up multi-factor authentication for guests

1. Go to [Azure conditional access policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade).
2. On the **Conditional Access | Policies** blade, click **New policy**.
3. In the **Name** field, type a name.
4. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**.
5. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Select users and groups**, select the **All guests and external users** check box.
6. Under **Assignments**, click **Cloud apps or actions**.
7. On the **Cloud apps or actions** blade, select **All cloud apps** on the **Include** tab.
8. Under **Access controls**, click **Grant**.
9. On the **Grant** blade, select the **Require multi-factor authentication** check box, and then click **Select**.
10. On the **New** blade, under **Enable policy**, click **On**, and then click **Create**.

Now, guest will be required to enroll in multi-factor authentication before they can access shared content, sites, or teams.

## Set up a terms of use for guests

In some situations guests may not have signed non-disclosure agreements or other legal agreements with your organization. You can require guests to agree to a terms of use before accessing files that are shared with them. The terms of use can be displayed the first time they attempt to access a shared file or site.

To create a terms of use, you first need to create the document in Word or another authoring program, and then save it as a .pdf file. This file can then be uploaded to Azure AD.

To create an Azure AD terms of use

1. Sign in to Azure as a Global Administrator, Security Administrator, or Conditional Access Administrator.
2. Navigate to [Terms of use](https://aka.ms/catou).
3. Click **New terms**.

   ![Screenshot of Azure AD new terms of use settings.](../media/azure-ad-guest-terms-of-use.png)

4. Type a **Name** and **Display name**.
6. For **Terms of use document**, browse to the pdf file that you created and select it.
7. Select the language for your terms of use document.
8. Set **Require users to expand the terms of use** to **On**.
9. Under **Conditional Access**, in the **Enforce with Conditional Access policy template** list choose **Create conditional access policy later**.
10. Click **Create**.

Once you've created the terms of use, the next step is to create a conditional access policy that displays the terms of use to guests.

To create a conditional access policy

1. Go to [Azure conditional access policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade).
2. On the **Conditional Access | Policies** blade, click **New policy**.
3. In the **Name** box, type a name.
4. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**.
5. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Select users and groups**, select the **All guests and external users** check box.
6. Under **Assignments**, click **Cloud apps or actions**.
7. On the **Include** tab, select **Select apps**, and then click **Select**.
8. On the **Select** blade, select **Microsoft Teams**, **Office 365 SharePoint Online**, and **Outlook Groups**, and then click **Select**.
9. Under **Access controls**, click **Grant**.
10. On the **Grant** blade, select **Guest terms of use**, and then click **Select**.
11. On the **New** blade, under **Enable policy**, click **On**, and then click **Create**.

Now, the first time a guest attempts to access content or a team or site in your organization, they will be required to accept the terms of use.

> [!NOTE]
> Using Conditional Access requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license. For more information, see [What is Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).

## Set up guest access reviews

With access reviews in Azure AD, you can automate a periodic review of user access to various teams and groups. By requiring an access review for guests specifically, you can help ensure guests do not retain access to your organization's sensitive information for longer than is necessary.

To set up a guest access review

1. On the [Identity Governance page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_ERM/DashboardBlade), in the left menu, click **Access reviews**.
2. Click **New access review**.
3. Choose the **Teams + Groups** option.
4. Choose the **All Microsoft 365 groups with guest users** option. Click **Select group(s) to exclude** if you want to exclude any groups.
5. Choose the **Guest users only** option, and then click **Next: Reviews**.
6. Under **Select reviewers**, choose **Group Owner(s)**.
7. Click **Select fallback reviewers**, choose who should be the fallback reviewers, and then click **Select**.
8. Under **Specify recurrence of review**, choose **Quarterly**.
9. Select a start date and duration.
10. For **End**, choose **Never**, and then click **Next: Settings**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure AD access review tab.](../media/azure-ad-create-access-review.png)

11. On the **Settings** tab, review the settings for compliance with your business rules.

    ![Screenshot of Azure AD access review settings tab.](../media/azure-ad-create-access-review-settings.png)

12. Click **Next: Review + Create**.
13. Type a **Review name** and review the settings.
14. Click **Create**.

It's important to note that guests can be given access to teams or groups, or to individual files and folders. When given access to files and folders, guests may not be added to any particular group. If you want to do access reviews on guests who don't belong to a team or group, you can create a dynamic group in Azure AD to contain all guests and then create an access review for that group. Site owners can also manage [guest expiration for the site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/25bee24f-42ad-4ee8-8402-4186eed74dea)

## Set up web-only access for guests

You can reduce your attack surface and ease administration by requiring guests to access your teams, sites, and files by using a web browser only.

For Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams, this is done with an Azure AD conditional access policy. For SharePoint, this is configured in the SharePoint admin center. (You can also [use sensitivity labels to restrict guests to web-only access](../compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites.md).)

To restrict guests to web-only access for Groups and Teams:

1. Go to [Azure conditional access policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade).
2. On the **Conditional Access - Policies** blade, click **New policy**.
3. In the **Name** box, type a name.
4. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**.
5. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Select users and groups**, select the **All guests and external users** check box.
6. Under **Assignments**, click **Cloud apps or actions**.
7. On the **Include** tab, select **Select apps**, and then click **Select**.
8. On the **Select** blade, select **Microsoft Teams** and **Outlook Groups**, and then click **Select**.
9. Under **Assignments**, click **Conditions**.
10. On the **Conditions** blade, click **Client apps**.
11. On the **Client apps** blade, click **Yes** for **Configure**, and then select the **Mobile apps and desktop clients**, **Exchange ActiveSync clients**, and **Other clients** settings. Clear the **Browser** check box.

    ![Screenshot of Azure AD conditional access client apps settings.](../media/azure-ad-conditional-access-client-mobile.png)

12. Click **Done**.
13. Under **Access controls**, click **Grant**.
14. On the **Grant** blade, select **Require device to be marked as compliant** and **Require Hybrid Azure AD joined device**.
15. Under **For multiple controls**, select **Require one of the selected controls**, and then click **Select**.
16. On the **New** blade, under **Enable policy**, click **On**, and then click **Create**.

To restrict guests to web-ony access for SharePoint

1. In the [SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint), expand **Policies** and click **Access control**.
2. Click **Unmanaged devices**.
3. Select the **Allow limited, web-only access** option, and then click **Save**.

Note that this setting in the SharePoint admin center creates a supporting conditional access policy in Azure AD.

## Configure a session timeout for guests

Requiring guests to authenticate on a regular basis can reduce the possibility of unknown users accessing your organization's content if a guest's device isn't kept secure. You can configure a session timeout conditional access policy for guests in Azure AD.

To configure a guest session timeout policy

1. Go to [Azure conditional access policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade).
2. On the **Conditional Access - Policies** blade, click **New policy**.
3. In the **Name** box, type *Guest session timeout*.
4. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**.
5. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Select users and groups**, select the **All guests and external users** check box.
6. Under **Assignments**, click **Cloud apps or actions**.
7. On the **Include** tab, select **Select apps**, and then click **Select**.
8. On the **Select** blade, select **Microsoft Teams**, **Office 365 SharePoint Online**, and **Outlook Groups**, and then click **Select**.
9. Under **Access controls**, click **Session**.
10. On the **Session** blade, select **Sign-in frequency**.
11. Select **1** and **Days** for the time period, and then click **Select**.
12. On the **New** blade, under **Enable policy**, click **On**, and then click **Create**.

## Create a sensitive information type for a highly sensitive project

Sensitive information types are predefined strings that can be used in policy workflows to enforce compliance requirements. The Microsoft 365 Compliance Center comes with over one hundred sensitive information types, including driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.

You can create custom sensitive information types to help manage content specific to your organization. In this example, we'll create a custom sensitive information type for a highly sensitive project. We can then use this sensitive information type to automatically apply a sensitivity label.

To create a sensitive information type

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), in the left navigation, expand **Classification**, and then click **Sensitive info types**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. For **Name** and **Description**, type **Project Saturn**, and then click **Next**.
4. Click **Add an element**.
5. On the **Detect content containing** list, select **Keywords**, and then type *Project Saturn* in the keyword box.
6. Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
7. If asked if you would like to test the sensitive information type, click **No**.

## Create an auto-labeling policy to assign a sensitivity label based on a sensitive information type

If you are using sensitivity labels in your organization, you can automatically apply a label to files that contain defined sensitive information types. 

To create an auto-labeling policy

1. Open the [Microsoft 365 compliance admin center](https://compliance.microsoft.com).
2. In the left navigation, click **Information protection**.
3. On the **Auto-labeling** tab, click **Create auto-labeling policy**.
4. On the **Choose info you want this label applied to** page, choose **Custom** and click **Next**.
5. Type a name and description for the policy and click **Next**.
6. On the **Choose locations where you want to apply the label** page, turn on **SharePoint sites** and click **Choose sites**.
7. Add the URLs for the sites where you want to turn on auto-labeling and click **Done**.
8. Click **Next**.
9. On the **Set up common or advanced rules** page, choose **Common rules** and click **Next**.
10. On the **Define rules for content in all locations** page, click **New rule**.
11. On the **New rule** page, give the rule a name, click **Add condition**, and then click **Content contains sensitive info types**.
12. Click **Add**, click **Sensitive info types**, choose the sensitive info types that you want to use, click **Add**, and then click **Save**.
13. Click **Next**.
14. Click **Choose a label**, select the label you want to use, and then click **Add**.
15. Click **Next**.
16. Leave the policy in simulation mode and click **Next**.
17. Click **Create policy**, and then click **Done**.

With the policy in place, when a user types "Project Saturn" into a document, the auto-labeling policy will automatically apply the specified label when it scans the file.

## Create a DLP policy to remove guest access to highly sensitive files

You can use [data loss prevention (DLP)](../compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp.md) to prevent unwanted guest sharing of sensitive content. Data loss prevention can take action based on a file's sensitivity label and remove guest access.

To create a DLP rule

1. In the Microsoft 365 compliance admin center, go to the [Data loss prevention page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/datalossprevention).
2. Click **Create policy**.
3. Choose **Custom** and click **Next**.
4. Type a name for the policy and click **Next**.
5. On the **Locations to apply the policy** page turn off all settings except **SharePoint sites** and **OneDrive accounts**, and then click **Next**.
6. On the **Define policy settings** page, click **Next**.
7. On the **Customize advanced DLP rules** page, click **Create rule** and type a name for the rule.
8. Under **Conditions**, click **Add condition**, and choose **Content contains**.
9. Click **Add**, choose **Sensitivity labels**, choose the labels you want to use, and click **Add**.

   ![Screenshot of conditions options, sensitive info types, sensitivity labels, and retention labels.](../media/limit-accidental-exposure-dlp-conditions.png)

10. Under **Actions** click **Add an action** and choose **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations**.
11. Select the **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations** check box and then choose the **Only people outside your organization** option.

      ![Screenshot of DLP rule action options.](../media/dlp-remove-guest-access-sensitive-files.png)

12. Click **Save** and then click **Next**.
13. Choose your test options and click **Next**.
14. Click **Submit**, and then click **Done**.

It's important to note that this policy doesn't remove access if the guest is a member of the site or team as a whole. If you plan to have highly sensitive documents in a site or team with guest members, consider using [private channels in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/de3e20b0-7494-439c-b7e5-75899ebe6a0e) and only allowing members of your organization in the private channels.

## Additional options

There are some additional options in Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory that can help secure your guest sharing environment.

- You can create a list of allowed or denied sharing domains to limit who users can share with. See [Restrict sharing of SharePoint and OneDrive content by domain](/sharepoint/restricted-domains-sharing) and [Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list) for more information.
- You can limit which other Azure Active Directory tenants your users can connect to. See [Use tenant restrictions to manage access to SaaS cloud applications](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions) for information.
- You can create a managed environment where partners can help manage guest accounts. See [Create a B2B extranet with managed guests](/Office365/Enterprise/b2b-extranet) for information.
