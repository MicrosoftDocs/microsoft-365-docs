# Step 4. Configure Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge provides AI-powered web browsing capabilities. Using Intune, Microsoft Edge can be added, configured, and assigned to end-users at your organization. Once added and assigned, end-users can use Microsoft Edge to safely view and work with your company resources. Using Intune, you can also assign Microsoft Edge to your end-users to support conditional access, app protection, and single sign-on at your organization.

You can add Microsoft Edge to Intune as a store app (Android, iOS/iPadOS), a Built-In app (Android, iOS/iPadOS), a Windows 10 and later app, a macOS app, or a Managed Google Play store app. However, only the Microsoft Edge for the iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms support app configuration policies.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring Microsoft Edge using Intune applies to the following platforms:
> - iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
> - Android 8.0 or later for enrolled devices and Android 9.0 or later for unenrolled devices

When you use Intune's app configuration policies, you create and assign configuration settings separately from adding and assigning the app itself. Therefore, you should consider adding the app to Intune without assigning the app, create and assign an app configuration policy for the app, and then assign the app itself to the device or user.

There are two ways to deliver app configuration using Intune. The first way is to use the mobile device management (MDM) OS channel on enrolled devices for iOS and Android devices. The second way is to use the Mobile Application Management (MAM) channel. For more information, see [Delivery channels for app configuration policies](apps-config-overview.md#delivery-channels-for-app-configuration-policies). For more information about delivery channels, see [Managed App Configuration channel for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/sc2279/Introduction/Intro.html) and [Android in the Enterprise channel for Android](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When considering configuration setting for Microsoft Edge, also be aware that if you use the MAM channel, you'll want to consider how you protect the app using [app protection policies](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy) in Intune.

## Configuration settings

You, as the admin, can customize the behavior of Microsoft Edge by creating and assigning an app configuration policy for Edge. When you create an app configuration policy for Microsoft Edge in Intune, you commonly set one or more app configuration keys. Each configuration key is specifically named for the app. When you use a configuration key, you add the name of the configuration key, the value type, and the configuration value.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App configuration keys are case sensitive. Use the proper casing to ensure the configuration takes effect.

### Common settings for Microsoft protected apps

Microsoft Edge for iOS/iPadOS and Android supports the following configuration scenarios:

- Organization allowed accounts mode - Must have enrolled devices.

The locked view mode is often used together with MAM policy **com.microsoft.intune.mam.managedbrowser.NewTabPage.CustomURL** or MDM policy **EdgeNewTabPageCustomURL**, which allow organizations to configure a specific web page that is automatically launched when Edge is opened. Users are restricted to this web page and cannot navigate to other websites, providing a controlled environment for specific tasks or content consumption. |
