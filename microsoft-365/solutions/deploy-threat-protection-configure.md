# Configure threat protection capabilities across Microsoft 365

Follow these steps to configure threat protection across Microsoft 365.


## Step 1: Set up multi-factor authentication and Conditional Access policies

[Multi-factor authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) (MFA) requires users to verify their identity with a phone call or authenticator app. [Conditional access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) define certain requirements that must be met in order for users to access apps and data in Microsoft 365. MFA and Conditional Access policies work together to protect your organization. For example, if someone attempts to sign in from a mobile device using an account that  is not enabled for MFA, and a Conditional Access policy requires MFA to be in effect, that user will be prevented from signing in.  

Microsoft has tested and recommends a specific set of Conditional Access and related policies for protecting access to all of your SaaS applications, especially Microsoft 365. Policies are recommended for baseline, sensitive, and highly regulated protection. Begin by implementing the policies for baseline protection.

## Step 2: Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity

[Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) is a cloud-based security solution that works with your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Microsoft Defender for Identity enables security operations (SecOps) analysts and security professionals struggling to detect advanced attacks in hybrid environments to:
- Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics.
- Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory.
- Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain.
- Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage.

### To set up Microsoft Defender for Identity

![Process for deploying Microsoft Defender for Identity](../media/deploy-threat-protection/deploy-azure-atp-steps.png) 

1. [Set up Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/install-atp-step1) to protect your primary environments.
2. Protect all your [domain controllers](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-sensor-monitoring) and [forests](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-multi-forest).
3. Integrate [Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/suspicious-activity-guide?tabs=external) into your security operations (SecOps) workflow.

## Step 3: Turn on Microsoft 365 Defender

[Microsoft 365 Defender](../security/mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md) combines signals and orchestrates capabilities into a single solution. With the integrated Microsoft 365 Defender solution, security professionals can stitch together the threat signals that each of these products receive and determine the full scope and impact of the threat; how it entered the environment, what it's affected, and how it's currently impacting the organization. Microsoft 365 Defender takes automatic action to prevent or stop the attack and self-heal affected mailboxes, endpoints, and user identities.

Microsoft 365 Defender unifies alerts, incidents, automated investigation and response, and advanced hunting across workloads (Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Cloud App Security) into a single pane of glass experience. After you have configured one or more of your Defender for Office 365 services, turn on Microsoft 365 Defender. New features are added continually to Microsoft 365 Defender; consider opting in to receive preview features.

## Step 7: Monitor status and take actions

After you have set up and deployed your threat protection services and capabilities, your next step is to monitor threat detections, and take appropriate actions. Your best starting point is the Microsoft 365 security center ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), where you can monitor and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. 

![Microsoft 365 security center](../media/solutions-architecture-center/m365-security-center.png)

The Microsoft 365 security center is specifically intended for security admins and security operations teams. In the Microsoft 365 security center, you can:
- View the overall security health of your organization with [Secure Score](../security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score.md).
- [Monitor and view reports](../security/mtp/overview-security-center.md) on the status of your identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure.
- Connect the dots on alerts through [incidents](../security/mtp/incident-queue.md).
- Use [automated investigation and remediation](../security/mtp/mtp-autoir.md) to address threats.
- [Proactively hunt for threats](../security/mtp/advanced-hunting-overview.md), such as intrusion attempts or breach activity affecting your email, data, devices, and identities.

## Step 8: Train users

Training users can save your users and security operations team much time and frustration. Savvy users are less likely to open attachments or click links in questionable email messages, and they are more likely to avoid suspicious websites. 

The Harvard Kennedy School [Cybersecurity Campaign Handbook](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2015598&amp;clcid=0x409) provides excellent guidance on establishing a strong culture of security awareness within your organization, including training users to identify phishing attacks. 

Microsoft 365 provides the following resources to help inform users in your organization:

|Concept  |Resources  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft 365     |[Customizable learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/) <p>These resources can help you put together training for end users in your organization        |
|Microsoft 365 security |[Learning module: Secure your organization with built-in, intelligent security from Microsoft 365](/learn/modules/security-with-microsoft-365) <p>This module enables you to describe how Microsoft 365 security features work together and to articulate the benefits of these security features. |
