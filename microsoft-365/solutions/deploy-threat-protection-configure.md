# Configure threat protection capabilities across Microsoft 365

Follow these steps to configure threat protection across Microsoft 365.


## Step 1: Set up multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies

[Multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) (MFA) requires users to verify their identity with a phone call or authenticator app. [Conditional access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) define certain requirements that must be met in order for users to access apps and data in Microsoft 365. MFA and conditional access policies work together to protect your organization. For example, if someone attempts to sign in from a mobile device using an account that  is not enabled for MFA, and a conditional access policy requires MFA to be in effect, that user will be prevented from signing in.  

Microsoft has tested and recommends a specific set of conditional access and related policies for protecting access to all of your SaaS applications, especially Microsoft 365. Policies are recommended for baseline, sensitive, and highly regulated protection. Begin by implementing the policies for baseline protection. 


[![Common policies for configuring identity and device access](../media/microsoft-365-policies-configurations/Identity_device_access_policies_byplan.png)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/media/microsoft-365-policies-configurations/Identity_device_access_policies_byplan.png)

## Step 2: Configure Azure Advanced Threat Protection

[Azure Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) (Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that works with your on-premises [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Azure ATP enables security operations (SecOps) analysts and security professionals struggling to detect advanced attacks in hybrid environments to:
- Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics.
- Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory.
- Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain.
- Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage.

### To set up Azure ATP

![Process for deploying Azure ATP](../media/solutions-architecture-center/deploy-azure-atp-steps.png) 

1. [Set up Azure ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/install-atp-step1) to protect your primary environments.
2. Protect all your [domain controllers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-sensor-monitoring) and [forests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-multi-forest).
3. Integrate [Azure ATP alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/suspicious-activity-guide?tabs=external) into your security operations (SecOps) workflow.

## Step 3: Turn on Microsoft Threat Protection

[Microsoft Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-threat-protection) combines signals and orchestrates capabilities into a single solution. With the integrated Microsoft Threat Protection solution, security professionals can stitch together the threat signals that each of these products receive and determine the full scope and impact of the threat; how it entered the environment, what it's affected, and how it's currently impacting the organization. Microsoft Threat Protection takes automatic action to prevent or stop the attack and self-heal affected mailboxes, endpoints, and user identities.

Microsoft Threat Protection unifies alerts, incidents, automated investigation and response, and advanced hunting across workloads (Azure ATP, Office 365 ATP, Microsoft Defender ATP, and Microsoft Cloud App Security) into a single pane of glass experience. After you have configured one or more of your advanced threat protection services, turn on Microsoft Threat Protection. New features are added continually to Microsoft Threat Protection; consider opting in to receive preview features.

## Step 8: Train users

Training users can save your users and security operations team much time and frustration. Savvy users are less likely to open attachments or click links in questionable email messages, and they are more likely to avoid suspicious websites. 

The Harvard Kennedy School [Cybersecurity Campaign Handbook](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2015598&amp;clcid=0x409) provides excellent guidance on establishing a strong culture of security awareness within your organization, including training users to identify phishing attacks. 

Microsoft 365 provides the following resources to help inform users in your organization:

|Concept  |Resources  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft 365     |[Customizable learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/) <p>These resources can help you put together training for end users in your organization        |
|Microsoft 365 security |[Learning module: Secure your organization with built-in, intelligent security from Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/security-with-microsoft-365) <p>This module enables you to describe how Microsoft 365 security features work together and to articulate the benefits of these security features. |
|Multi-factor authentication     | [Two-step verification: What is the additional verification page?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-first-time) <p>This article helps end users understand what multi-factor authentication is and why it's being used at your organization.    |

In addition to this guidance, Microsoft recommends that your users take the actions described in this article: [Protect your account and devices from hackers and malware](https://support.office.com/article/066d6216-a56b-4f90-9af3-b3a1e9a327d6.aspx). These actions include:
- Using strong passwords
- Protecting devices 
- Enabling security features on Windows 10 and Mac PCs (for unmanaged devices)
    
Microsoft also recommends that users protect their personal email accounts by taking the actions recommended in the following articles:
- [Help protect your Outlook.com email account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/help-protect-your-outlook-com-email-account-a4f20fc5-4307-4ece-8231-6d4d4bd8a9ba)
