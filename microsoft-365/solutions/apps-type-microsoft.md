# Understand Microsoft apps in Intune

There are specific Microsoft app types that allow you to install and manage Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The app types are specific to Windows 10 and later, and also macOS. Users must have an account and license to use these apps, such as one of the license you can select for Microsoft Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> For licensing and plan information related to device and app management, see [Microsoft 365 enterprise plans](/microsoft-365/enterprise).

## Microsoft apps that support Intune

You and the members of your organization may use Microsoft Office, OneDrive, Excel, and Outlook regularly, which are all supported by Microsoft Intune. However, there are dozens of other Microsoft apps for Android and iOS/iPadOS that support various app capabilities supported by Intune. These include the following capabilities:
- Core app protection policy settings
- App configuration
- Org allowed accounts (iOS, Android)
- Sync policy managed app data with native apps (iOS, Android)
- Org data notifications (iOS, Android)
- Open data into Org documents (iOS, Android)
- Save copies of org data (iOS, Android)

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the Microsoft apps connect the user to services, such as OneDrive.
