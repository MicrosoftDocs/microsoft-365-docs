# Step 6: Train remote workers and address usage feedback

Train your remote workers on:

- Proper sign-in procedures using MFA, including registering an additional verification method.
- The use of devices and how endpoint management policies can be used to block access for non-compliant devices.
- The use of allowed apps and how endpoint management application polices can be used to block the use of apps.
- Windows 10 Enterprise security features.
- How to use [Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/training-microsoft-teams-landing-page) for chat, video-based conferencing, document sharing, and threaded conversations.
- How to use [Outlook](https://support.office.com/article/outlook-training-8a5b816d-9052-4190-a5eb-494512343cca) for email and scheduling.
- How to use [SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/sharepoint-online-video-training-cb8ef501-84db-4427-ac77-ec2009fb8e23) team or communication sites and [OneDrive](https://support.office.com/article/onedrive-video-training-1f608184-b7e6-43ca-8753-2ff679203132) folders to browse and collaborate on files in a user's library and those belonging to a group.

This training should include hands-on exercises so that your workers can experience these capabilities and their results.

In the weeks after training:

- Quickly address remote worker feedback and fine tune policies and configurations.
- Analyze usage for teams, email, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive folders and compare it with usage expectations.

Then, retrain your users as needed.

## Results of Step 6

Your remote workers are trained and there is a responsive and open forum for them to provide feedback and post issues with remote access and productivity apps and services.
