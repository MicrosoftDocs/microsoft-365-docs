# Groups services interactions

Microsoft 365 Groups provides a common fabric for several services and workloads within the Microsoft 365 platform to deliver a connected experience for end users. At its core, a Microsoft 365 group exists to provide:

- A way to manage the membership (Azure AD)
- A place for messaging and conversations to take place (Exchange mailbox, Microsoft Teams, Yammer)
- A place for files to be stored (SharePoint)
- A calendar for scheduling (Exchange)
- A notebook for capturing notes (OneNote)

At the point of group creation, several other resources are also provisioned, however they are not visible until accessed for the first time from the service:

- A board for managing group tasks (Planner)
- A workspace for reporting (Power BI)
- An area for shared videos (Microsoft Stream)
- An area for shared forms (Forms)

Across Microsoft 365, other services are able to interact with Microsoft 365 groups to deliver additional functionality and capabilities to group members.
Examples of this include:

- Power Apps for apps
- Power Automate for workflows
- Project on the web and Roadmap for waterfall-based project management
- Teams for channel-based conversations
- Yammer for communities of interest

## User interactions with groups

Microsoft 365 Groups can be created and managed from various interfaces, both by administrators and end users. 

### Administrative experiences

Administrators can create and manage Microsoft 365 groups from several of the workload admin centers, command-line interfaces that support scripting, as well as custom-built apps interacting with the Graph API. The only exception to this is Yammer groups – which must be created from within the Yammer web interface.

**Related settings**

Across the various administrative interfaces that can manage group settings exists several overlaps that you should be aware of.

**Microsoft 365 admin center**

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, guest access to Groups is enabled by default, as is the ability to allow owners to add guests. There are no further organization-level controls available for Groups from this admin center.

**Azure AD admin center**

The Azure AD admin center offers controls around whether users can create Groups or assign owners in Azure portals, as well as expiration and naming policy settings.

The admin center also provides several guest invitation control measures that go beyond that of the Microsoft 365 admin center, such as the ability to limit whether non-owners can also invite guests

**SharePoint**

SharePoint sites are created with Owner, Member, and Visitor security groups, with the first two matching up to their Microsoft 365 group counterparts. While membership for SharePoint Online sites is generally managed by the associated Microsoft 365 group, it is not a bidirectional relationship. Any changes to membership at the Microsoft 365 group level are reflected in SharePoint, however if membership is changed in the SharePoint group, this is not reflected in the Microsoft 365 group.

### User experiences

End users can create groups from several of the services within Microsoft 365, and in others they can only share with a group.

The following services allow creation of groups by end users:

- Outlook
- Planner
- Project for the web
- SharePoint
- Stream
- Microsoft Teams
- Yammer

#### Restriction of group creation

A common approach to control sprawl of teams is to limit which users can create them. This can only be done by limiting the creation of groups. Doing this impacts the ability to create groups from other services where that may be necessary for end user. Microsoft 365 Groups does not support the ability to restrict the creation of groups from some apps or services while allowing it from others.

The experience of group creation restriction varies between apps and services:

|App or service|Experience|
|---|---|
|Outlook|**New group** option is removed from New menu in people page|
|Planner|**New plan** explains that group creation has been turned off and offers to add the plan to an existing group|
|Project for the web and Roadmap|**Create group** menu explains that group creation is restricted and suggests using an existing group.|
|SharePoint|Still able to create a team site that is not connected to a group.|
|Stream|**Group** option does not appear under the **Create menu**.|
|Teams|User cannot create a team with a new group but can still create a team that utilizes an existing group.<br><br>**Create a team** button is replaced with **Create team from a group**.|
|Yammer|**Create a group** option is removed from main Groups/Communities navigation.|

## Services interactions with groups

See the Groups in Microsoft 365 poster for information about different types of groups, how these are created and managed, and a few governance recommendations.

While the table above provides a high-level overview of group interactions with Microsoft 365 services, there are several nuances and intricacies that you should understand. The following sections take a more in-depth look at the specific workloads and their interactions with groups.

**Can Azure AD create a Group?**

Yes, Microsoft 365 Groups can be created from Azure AD either through the administration web portal, through PowerShell, or Graph API.

**Does Azure AD exist without a group?**

Yes, Azure AD performs a great number of services that have no relation to Microsoft 365 Groups. Each Microsoft 365 group is represented as an object in Azure AD.

**Can there be multiple instances of Azure AD per Group?**

No, there is only one instance of Azure AD.

**Can Azure AD be associated with multiple Groups?**

Yes, because Azure AD is the underlying platform that provides the group membership service.

**Can Azure AD’s association with a group change?**

No, Azure AD is the underlying platform where groups exist.

**Does deleting the instance delete the Group?**

Deleting the group in Azure AD will delete relevant group-associated services and content.

## Teams

Teams is a chat-centered workspace aimed at enhancing collaboration by providing a singular interface to interact with various Microsoft and third-party services.

By default, when a team is created, the mailbox and calendar associated with the Microsoft 365 group are hidden from both the Global Address List in Exchange, as well as Outlook. This can be manually overridden by an administrator if the user would like to use both Outlook and Teams on the same Microsoft 365 group.

**Key features provided to Groups**

- Conversations
- Channels & tabs

No, it is not possible for a team to exist without a Group.

**Can there be multiple teams per group?**

No, the relationship between a team and a group is 1:1.

Yes, deleting the workspace in Power BI will delete group and  group-associated services and content.

## Power BI (new)

Power BI provides interactive data-driven dashboards and reports.
