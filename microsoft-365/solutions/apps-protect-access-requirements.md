# Understand app protection access requirements

The **Access requirements** settings allow you to configure the PIN and credential requirements that users must meet to access apps in a work context. As the admin, you can control whether to use a PIN for app access, require work or school account credentials for access, and how often to recheck access requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Access requirement** settings only apply to iOS/iPadOS and Android app protection policies.

## Access requirements for app protection policies

For iOS/iPadOS and Android app protection policies, the available app access settings are similar between iOS/iPadOS and Android. Differences include details for biometrics and PIN reset.

### iOS access requirement settings

You'll see that iOS/iPadOS offer slightly different app protection functionality.
