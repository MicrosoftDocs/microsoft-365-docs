# Step 3: Deploy security and compliance for remote workers

For remote workers, some of whom never go into the office or who go infrequently, security and compliance are an important part of the overall solution. All of their communications occur over the Internet instead of being confined to an organizational intranet. 

There are things you and your workers can do to remain productive while decreasing cybersecurity risk and maintaining compliance with your internal policies and data regulations.

Remote work needs these elements of security and compliance:

- Controlled access to the productivity apps that remote workers use, such as Microsoft Teams 
- Controlled access to and protection of the data that remote workers create and use, such as chat conversations or shared files
- Protection of Windows 10 devices from malware and other types of cyberattacks
- Protection of email, files, and site with consistent labeling for levels of sensitivity and protection
- Prevention of leaked information
- Adherence to regional data regulations

Here are the features of Microsoft 365 that provide security and compliance services for remote workers.
