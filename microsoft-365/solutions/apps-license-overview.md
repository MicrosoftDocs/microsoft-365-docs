# Understand app licenses used in Intune

Before you can distribute managed apps to members of your organization, you must add the apps to Intune. Many of the apps that you use with Intune can be added to Intune and deployed to user's devices for free. However, some apps that you can deploy to the members of your organization may require either a license, subscription, or account for each user to use the app. Intune helps you manage app licenses as tokens. Additionally, Intune uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to help manage user credentials that managed apps can utilize.  

The following table provides the primary ways to obtain app licenses that you can use with Intune:

| App   license type | Description |
|---|---|
| Standard license included with app | You can freely add these apps to Intune and deploy them to the members of your organization. These apps don't require any additional cost to use.  |
| Purchased app license  | You must purchase licenses for these apps before adding them to Intune and deploying them to members of your   organization. Each device platform (Windows, iOS, Android) offers a standard method to purchase licenses for these apps. In addition, Intune provides methods to manage the app license for each member (end user) of your organization. |
| License   for apps that requiring an account, subscription, or license from the app   developer | You can freely add and deploy the app from Intune, but the app requires an account, subscription, or license from the app vendor to use. |
| Microsoft app license of apps included with your Intune license | Based on your Microsoft Intune license, you may already have Microsoft app licenses available, allowing you to add and deploy apps to members of your organization. |

## Standard license included with app

As previously mentioned, many of the apps available to select within [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) are free to use. You can add these apps to Intune and assign them to the members of your organization without additional cost. The members of your organization can use the app without any additional license, subscription, or account. Each app may have their own standard use-license.

> [!NOTE]
> Each app type for their related platform is added within [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add**.

For more information, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune Overview](apps-add-overview.md).

## Acquire app licenses

For iOS apps, you can purchase or acquire app licenses in-volume through Apple's volume purchase program (VPP). Apple lets you purchase multiple app licenses using [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/). Depending on your Microsoft Intune license, you may already have Microsoft app licenses for specific apps available to add and deploy. Once you've connected your VPP app license with Intune, you can find and add those apps using the regular [Add app](apps-add-overview.md) process. For more information, see [Understanding licensed apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add#understanding-licensed-apps) and [Purchase apps in-volume for Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md).

## Apps requiring account, subscription, or license from the app vendor

You can freely add and deploy most apps provided within [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), but there are apps that require an account, subscription, or license from the app vendor to use. After [assessing your organization's app requirements](apps-add-step-1.md), you must contact the app vendor for apps that you can't purchase through a VPP program.
