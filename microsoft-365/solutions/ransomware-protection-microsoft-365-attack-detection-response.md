# Step 2. Deploy attack detection and response

As a strongly recommended initial step for ransomware attack detection and response in your Microsoft 365 tenant, [set up a trial environment](/microsoft-365/security/defender/eval-overview) to evaluate the features and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender.

For additional information, see these resources.

| Feature | Description | Where to start | How to use it for detection and response |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender) | Combines signals and orchestrates capabilities into a single solution. <br><br> Enables security professionals to stitch together threat signals and determine the full scope and impact of a threat. <br><br> Automates actions to prevent or stop the attack and self-heal affected mailboxes, endpoints, and user identities. | [Get started](/microsoft-365/security/defender/get-started) | [Incident response](/microsoft-365/security/defender/incidents-overview) |
