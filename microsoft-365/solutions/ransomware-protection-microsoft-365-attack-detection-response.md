Use these tools to detect and respond to the following common threats from ransomware attackers:

- Credential theft

   - Azure AD Identity Protection
   - Microsoft Defender for Identity
   - Microsoft Defender for Office 365

- Device compromise

   - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
   - Microsoft Defender for Office 365

- Escalation of privilege

   - Azure AD Identity Protection
   - Microsoft Cloud App Security

- Malicious app behavior

   - Microsoft Cloud App Security

- Data exfiltration, deletion, or updloading

   - Microsoft Defender for Office 365
   - Microsoft Cloud App Security with [anomaly detection policies](/cloud-app-security/anomaly-detection-policy#ransomware-activity)

The following tools use Microsoft 365 Defender and its portal (https://security.microsoft.com) as a common threat collection and analysis point:

- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Cloud App Security

Microsoft 365 Defender combines threat signals into alerts and connected alerts into an incident so that your security analysts can more quickly detect, investigate, and remediate the phases of a ransomware attack.

You can [set up a trial environment](/microsoft-365/security/defender/eval-overview) to evaluate the features and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender.
