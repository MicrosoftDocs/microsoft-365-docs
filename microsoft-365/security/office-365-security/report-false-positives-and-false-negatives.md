# Report false positives and false negatives in Outlook

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin in a Microsoft 365 organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or on-premises mailboxes using hybrid modern authentication, you can submit false positives (good email marked as spam) and false negatives (bad email and phish allowed) to Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

## Things to remember before you use the Report Message feature

- For the best user submission experience, use the Report Message add-in or the Report Phishing add-in.

- Note that this add-in works for Outlook in all platformsâ€”on the web, iOS, Android, and Desktop.

- If you're an admin in an organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

- You can configure to send messages directly to Microsoft, a mailbox you specify, or both. For more information, see [User submissions policies](user-submission.md).

- For more information about reporting messages to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## Use the Report Message feature

### Report junk and phishing messages

For messages in the Inbox or any other email folder except Junk Email, use the following method to report spam and phishing messages:

1. Click the **More actions** ellipses on the top-right corner of the selected message, click **Report message** from the dropdown menu, and then select **Junk** or **Phishing**.
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Report Message - More actions](../../media/report-message-more-actions.png)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Report Message - Junk and Phishing](../../media/report-message-junk-phishing.png)

2. The selected messages will be sent to Microsoft for analysis and:

   - Moved to the Junk Email folder if it was reported as spam.

   - Deleted if it was reported as phishing.
   
### Report messages that are not junk

1. Click the **More actions** ellipses on the top-right corner of the selected message, click **Report message** from the dropdown menu, and then click **Not Junk**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Report Message - More actions](../../media/report-message-more-actions.png)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Report Message - Not junk](../../media/report-message-not-junk.png)

2. The selected message will be sent to Microsoft for analysis and moved to Inbox or any other specified folder.

## Enable the Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins

The Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins for Outlook and Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) enable people to easily report false positives (good email marked as bad) or false negatives (bad email allowed) to Microsoft and its affiliates for analysis. 

Microsoft uses these submissions to improve the effectiveness of email protection technologies. For example, suppose that people are reporting many messages using the Report Phishing add-in. This information surfaces in the Security Dashboard and other reports. Your organization's security team can use this information as an indication that anti-phishing policies might need to be updated. 

You can install either the Report Message or Report Phishing add-in. If you want your users to report both spam and phishing messages, deploy the Report Message add-in in your organization. For more information, see Enable the Report Message add-in. 

The Report Message add-in provides the option to report both spam and phishing messages. Admins can enable the Report Message add-in for the organization, and individual users can install it for themselves. 

The Report Phishing add-in provides the option to report only phishing messages. Admins can enable the Report Phishing add-in for the organization, and individual users can install it for themselves. 

If you're an individual user, you can enable both the add-ins for yourself.

f you're a global administrator or an Exchange Online administrator, and Exchange is configured to use OAuth authentication, you can enable the Report Message add-in and the Report Phishing add-in for your organization. Both add-ins are now available through [Centralized Deployment](../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Both the Report Message add-in and the Report Phishing add-in works with most Microsoft 365 subscriptions and the following products:

  - Outlook on the web
  - Outlook 2013 SP1 or later
  - Outlook 2016 for Mac
  - Outlook included with Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise
  - Outlook app for iOS and Android

- Both add-ins are not available for shared mailboxes or mailboxes in on-premises Exchange organizations.

- Your existing web browser should work with both the Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins. But, if you notice the add-in is not available or not working as expected, try a different browser.

- For organizational installs, the organization needs to be configured to use OAuth authentication. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).

- Admins need to be a member of the Global admins role group. For more information, see [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).
