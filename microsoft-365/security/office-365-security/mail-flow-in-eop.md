# Mail flow in EOP

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes, or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, all messages sent to your organization pass through EOP before your workers see them. You have options about how to route messages that pass through EOP for processing before they are routed to your worker inboxes.

## Working with messages and message access options

EOP offers flexibility in how your messages are routed. The following topics explain steps in the mail flow process.

[Use Directory Based Edge Blocking to reject messages sent to invalid recipients](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-directory-based-edge-blocking) Describes the Directory Based Edge Blocking feature which lets you reject messages for invalid recipients at the service network perimeter.

[View or Edit Managed Domains in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains) describes how to manage domains that are associated with your EOP service.

If you add subdomains to your organization, your EOP service can help you manage these too. Learn more about subdomains at [Enable mail flow for subdomains in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/enable-mail-flow-for-subdomains).

[Configure mail flow using connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow) introduces connectors and shows how you can use them to customize mail routing. Scenarios include ensuring secure communication with a partner organization and setting up a smart host.

[Enhanced Filtering for Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors) describes how to configure connectors if your mail is routed to a service or device before EOP.

In standalone EOP organizations, you need to perform a couple configuration steps to ensure that junk email is routed correctly to each user's junk-email folder. These are detailed in [Configure standalone EOP to deliver spam to the Junk Email folder in hybrid environments](ensure-that-spam-is-routed-to-each-user-s-junk-email-folder.md). If you do not want to move messages to each user's junk-email folder, you may choose another action by editing your anti-spam policies (also known as content filter policies). For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

## Verify mail flow

To verify that your EOP setup, including your connector configuration, is working correctly, see the "How do you know this task worked?" section in [Set up your EOP service](set-up-your-eop-service.md).

[Test mail flow by validating your Microsoft 365 connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/test-mail-flow) provides instructions for testing that your mail flow is set up correctly.
