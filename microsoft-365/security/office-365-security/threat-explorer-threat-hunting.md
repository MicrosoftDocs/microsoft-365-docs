# Threat hunting in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Microsoft 365 organizations that have [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](mdo-about.md) included in their subscription or purchased as an add-on have **Explorer** (also known as **Threat Explorer**) or **Real-time detections**. These features are powerful, near real-time tools to help Security Operations (SecOps) teams investigate and respond to threats. For more information, see [About Threat Explorer and Real-time detections in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md).

Threat Explorer or Real-time detections allow you to take the following actions:

- See malware detected by Microsoft 365 security features.
- View phishing URL and click verdict data.
- Start an automated investigation and response process (Threat Explorer only).
- Investigate malicious email.
- And more.

Watch this short video to learn how to hunt and investigate email and collaboration-based threats using Defender for Office 365.

Threat Explorer or Real-time detections is available in the **Email & collaboration** section in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>:

- **Real-time detections** is available in _Defender for Office 365 Plan 1_. The **Real-time detections** page is available directly at <https://security.microsoft.com/realtimereportsv3>.

  :::image type="content" source="../../media/te-rtd-select-real-time-detections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Real-time detections selection in the Email & collaboration section in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/te-rtd-select-real-time-detections.png":::

- **Threat Explorer** is available in _Defender for Office 365 Plan 2_. The **Explorer** page is available directly at <https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorerv3>.

  :::image type="content" source="../../media/te-rtd-select-threat-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Explorer selection in the Email & collaboration section in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/te-rtd-select-threat-explorer.png":::

Threat Explorer contains the same information and capabilities as Real-time detections, but with the following additional features:

- More views.
- More property filtering options, including the option to save queries.
- Threat hunting and remediation actions.

For more information about the differences between Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2, see the [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 vs. Plan 2 cheat sheet](mdo-about.md#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet).

Use the tabs (views) at the top of the page to start your investigation.

The available views in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections are described in the following table:

|View|Threat<br/>Explorer|Real-time<br/>detections|Description|
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
|**All email**|✔||Default view for Threat Explorer. Information about all email messages sent by external users into your organization, or email sent between internal users in your organization.|
|**Malware**|✔|✔|Default view for Real-time detections. Information about email messages that contain malware.|
|**Phish**|✔|✔|Information about email messages that contain phishing threats.|
|**Campaigns**|✔||Information about malicious email that Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 identified as part of a [coordinated phishing or malware campaign](campaigns.md).|
|**Content malware**|✔|✔|Information about malicious files detected by the following features: <ul><li>[Built-in virus protection in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](anti-malware-protection-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md)</li><li>[Safe Attachments for Sharepoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md)</li></ul>|
|**URL clicks**|✔||Information about user clicks on URLs in email messages, Teams messages, SharePoint files, and OneDrive files.|

Use the date/time filter and the available filter properties in the view to refine the results:

- For instructions to create filters, see [Property filters in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#property-filters-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).
- The available filter properties for each view are described in the following locations:
  - [Filterable properties in the All email view in Threat Explorer](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-all-email-view-in-threat-explorer)
  - [Filterable properties in the Malware view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)
  - [Filterable properties in the Phish view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-phish-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)
  - [Filterable properties in the Campaigns view in Threat Explorer](campaigns.md#filters-on-the-campaigns-page)
  - [Filterable properties in the Content malware view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-content-malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)
  - [Filterable properties in the URL clicks view in Threat Explorer](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-url-clicks-view-in-threat-explorer)

> [!TIP]
> Remember to select **Refresh** after you create or update the filter. The filters affect the information in the chart and the details area of the view.

You can think of refining the focus in Threat Explorer or Real-time detections as layers to make retracing your steps easier:

- The first layer is the view you're using.
- The second later is the filters you're using in that view.

For example, you can retrace the steps you took to find a threat by recording your decisions like this: To find the issue in Threat Explorer, I used the **Malware** view and used a **Recipient** filter focus.

Also, be sure to test your display options. Different audiences (for example, management) might react better or worse to different presentations of the same data.

For example, in Threat Explorer the **All email** view, the **Email origin** and **Campaigns** views (tabs) are available in the details area at the bottom of the page:

- For some audiences, the world map in the **Email origin** tab might do a better job of showing how widespread the detected threats are.

  :::image type="content" source="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-details-area-email-origin-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the world map in the Email origin view in the details area of the All email view in Threat Explorer." lightbox="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-details-area-email-origin-tab.png":::

- Others might find the detailed information in the table in the **Campaigns** tab more useful to convey the information.

  :::image type="content" source="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-details-area-campaign-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the details table in the Campaign tab in the All email view in Threat Explorer." lightbox="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-details-area-campaign-tab.png":::

You can use this information for the following results:

- To show the need for security and protection.
- To later demonstrate the effectiveness of any actions.

### Email investigation

In the **All email**, **Malware**, or **Phish** views in Threat Explorer or Real-time detections, email message results are shown in a table in the **Email** tab (view) of the details area below the chart.

When you see a suspicious email message, click on the **Subject** value of an entry in the table. The details flyout that opens contains :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open email entity** at the top of the flyout.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-email-tab-details-area-subject-details-flyout-actions-only.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the actions available in the email details flyout after you select a Subject value in the Email tab of the details area in the All email view." lightbox="../../media/te-rtd-all-email-view-email-tab-details-area-subject-details-flyout-actions-only.png":::

The Email entity page pulls together everything you need to know about the message and its contents so you can determine whether the message is a threat. For more information, see [Email entity page overview](mdo-email-entity-page.md).

### Email remediation

After you determine that an email message is a threat, the next step is remediating the threat. You remediate the threat in Threat Explorer or Real-time detections using **Message actions** or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Take action**.

These actions are available in the **All email**, **Malware**, or **Phish** views in Threat Explorer or Real-time detections in the **Email** tab (view) of the details area below the chart:

- Select one or more entries in the table by selecting the check box next to the first column. **Message actions** is available directly in the tab. For more information, see [Remediate using Message actions](#remediate-using-message-actions).

## The threat hunting experience using Threat Explorer and Real-time detections

Threat Explorer or Real-time detections helps your security operations team investigate and respond to threats efficiently. The following subsections explain how Threat Explorer and Real-time detections can help you find threats.

### Threat hunting from Alerts

The **Alerts** page is available in the Defender portal at **Incidents & alerts** \> **Alerts**, or directly at <https://security.microsoft.com/alerts>.

Many alerts with the **Detection source** value **MDO** have the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-show-trends-icon.png" border="false"::: **View messages in Explorer** action available at the top of the alert details flyout.

The alert details flyout opens when you click anywhere on the alert other than the check box next to the first column. For example:

- **A potentially malicious URL click was detected**
- **Admin submission result completed**
- **Email messages containing malicious URL removed after delivery​**
- **Email messages removed after delivery**
- **Messages containing malicious entity not removed after delivery**
- **Phish not zapped because ZAP is disabled**

:::image type="content" source="../../media/alerts-mdo-details-flyout-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the available actions in the alert details flyout of an alert with the Detections source value MDO from the Alerts page in the Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/alerts-mdo-details-flyout-actions.png":::

Selecting **View messages in Explorer** opens Threat Explorer in the **All email** view with the property filter **Alert ID** selected for the alert. The **Alert ID** value is a unique GUID value for the alert (for example, 89e00cdc-4312-7774-6000-08dc33a24419).

**Alert ID** is a filterable property in the following views in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections:

- [The **All email** view in Threat Explorer](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-all-email-view-in-threat-explorer).
- [The **Malware** view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)
- [The **Phish view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-phish-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)

In those views, **Alert ID** is available as a selectable column in the details area below the chart in the following tabs (views):

- [The **Email** view for the details area of the **All email** view in Threat Explorer](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-all-email-view-in-threat-explorer)
- [The **Email** view for the details area of the **Malware** view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)
- [The **Email** view for the details area of the **Phish** view in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-phish-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections)

In the [email details flyout that opens when you click on a **Subject** value from one of the entries](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-details-from-the-email-view-of-the-details-area-in-the-all-email-view), the **Alert ID** link is available in the **Email details** section of the flyout. Selecting the **Alert ID** link opens the **View alerts** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/viewalertsv2> with the alert selected and the details flyout open for the alert.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/view-alerts-page-with-details-flyout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the alert details flyout on the View alerts page after you select an Alert ID from the email details flyout of an entry in the Email tab from the All email, Malware, or Phish views in Threat Explorer or Real-time detections." lightbox="../../media/view-alerts-page-with-details-flyout.png":::

### Tags in Threat Explorer

In Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, if you use [user tags](user-tags-about.md) to mark high value targets accounts (for example, the **Priority account** tag) you can use those tags as filters. This method shows phishing attempts directed at high value target accounts during a specific time period. For more information about user tags, see [User tags](user-tags-about.md).

User tags are available in the following locations in Threat Explorer:

- **All email** view:
  - [As a filterable property](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#filterable-properties-in-the-all-email-view-in-threat-explorer).
  - [An available column in the **Email** tab (view) of the details area](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-all-email-view-in-threat-explorer).
  - [The email details flyout from an entry in the **Email** tab (view)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-details-from-the-email-view-of-the-details-area-in-the-all-email-view)
- **Malware** view:
  - [As a filterable property](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).
  - [An available column in the **Email** tab (view) of the details area in the **Malware** view](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-malware-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).
  - [[The email details flyout from an entry in the **Email** tab (view)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-details-from-the-email-view-of-the-details-area-in-the-all-email-view)
- **Phish** view:
  - [As a filterable property](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#phish-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).
  - [An available column in the **Email** tab (view) of the details](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-phish-view-in-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).
  - [The email details flyout from an entry in the **Email** tab (view)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-details-from-the-email-view-of-the-details-area-in-the-all-email-view)
- **URL clicks** view:
  - [As a filterable property](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#url-clicks-view-in-threat-explorer).
  - [An available column in the **Results** tab (view) of the details area in the **URL clicks** view](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#results-view-for-the-details-area-of-the-url-clicks-view-in-threat-explorer).

### Threat information for email messages

Pre-delivery and post-delivery actions on email messages are consolidated into a single record, regardless of the different post-delivery events that affected the message. For example:

- [Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)](zero-hour-auto-purge.md).
- Manual remediation (admin action).
- [Dynamic Delivery](safe-attachments-about.md#dynamic-delivery-in-safe-attachments-policies).

[The email details flyout from the **Email** tab (view)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#email-details-from-the-email-view-of-the-details-area-in-the-all-email-view) in the **All email**, **Malware**, or **Phish** views shows the associated threats and the corresponding detection technologies that are associated with the email message. A message can have zero, one, or multiple threats.

- In the **Delivery details** section, the **Detection technology** property shows the detection technology that identified the threat. **Detection technology** is also available as a chart pivot or a column in the details table for many views in Threat Explorer and Real-time detections.

- The **URLs** section shows specific **Threat** information for any URLs in the message. For example, **Malware**, **Phish**, **Spam, or **None**.

> [!TIP]
> Verdict analysis might not necessarily be tied to entities. The filters evaluate content and other details of an email message before assigning a verdict. For example, an email message might be classified as phishing or spam, but no URLs in the message are stamped with a phishing or spam verdict.

Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open email entity** at the top of the flyout to see exhaustive details about the email message. For more information, see [The Email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](mdo-email-entity-page.md).
