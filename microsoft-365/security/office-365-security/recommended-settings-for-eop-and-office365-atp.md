# Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md)

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for Microsoft 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes. But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are often required. **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** Plan 1 or Plan 2 contain additional features that give admins more layers of security, control, and investigation.

Although we empower security administrators to customize their security settings, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: **Standard** and **Strict**. Each customer's environment and needs are different, but we believe that these levels of filtering will help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees' Inbox in most situations.

To automatically apply the Standard or Strict settings to users, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The junk email rule needs to be enabled on mailboxes in order for filtering to work properly. It's enabled by default, but you should check it if filtering does not seem to be working. For more information, see [Configure junk email settings on Exchange Online mailboxes in Office 365](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md).

This article describes the default settings, and also the recommended Standard and Strict settings to help protect your users.

> [!TIP]
> The Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA) module for PowerShell can help you (admins) find the current values of these settings. Specifically, the **Get-ORCAReport** cmdlet generates an assessment of anti-spam, anti-phishing, and other message hygiene settings. You can download the ORCA module at <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/>.

## Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection in EOP

Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing are EOP features that can be configured by admins. We recommend the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### EOP anti-spam policy settings

To create and configure anti-spam policies, see [Configure anti-spam policies in Office 365](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

|

There are several other Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in anti-spam policies that are in the process of being deprecated. More information on the timelines for the depreciation of these features will be communicated outside of this article.

We recommend that you turn these ASF settings **Off** for both **Standard** and **Strict** levels. For more information about ASF settings, see [Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in Office 365](advanced-spam-filtering-asf-options.md).

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

Additional security benefits come with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 subscription. For the latest news and information, you can see [What's new in Defender for Office 365](whats-new-in-office-365-atp.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The default anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides [spoof protection](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#spoof-settings) and mailbox intelligence for all recipients. However, the other available [impersonation protection](#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) features and [advanced settings](#advanced-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) are not configured or enabled in the default policy. To enable all protection features, modify the default anti-phishing policy or create additional anti-phishing policies.
>
> - There are no default Safe Links policies or Safe Attachments policies that automatically protect all recipients in the organization. To get the protections, you need to create at least one Safe Links Policy and Safe Attachments policy.
>
> - [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) protection and [Safe Documents](safe-docs.md) protection have no dependencies on Safe Links policies.

If your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or if you've purchased Defender for Office 365 as an add-on, set the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

EOP customers get basic anti-phishing as previously described, but Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes more features and control to help prevent, detect, and remediate against attacks. To create and configure these policies, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-atp-anti-phishing-policies.md).

#### Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about these settings, see [Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). To configure these settings, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-atp-anti-phishing-policies.md).
