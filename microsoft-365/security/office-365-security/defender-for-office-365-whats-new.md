  - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 supports 10,000 block entries and 5,000 allow entries (via admin submissions) in each category.
  - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 supports 1,000 block entries and 1,000 allow entries (via admin submissions) in each category.
  - Exchange Online Protection remains at 500 block entries and 500 allow entries (via admin submissions) in each category.

## October 2023

- **Exchange Online permission management in Defender for Office 365 is now supported in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC)**: In addition to the existing support for [Email & collaboration permissions](mdo-portal-permissions.md), Defender XDR Unified RBAC now also supports protection-related [Exchange Online permissions](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo). To learn more about the supported Exchange Online permissions, see [Exchange Online permissions mapping](/microsoft-365/security/defender/compare-rbac-roles#exchange-online-permissions-mapping).

## September 2023

- URL top-level domain blocking is available in the **Tenant allow block list**. [Learn more](tenant-allow-block-list-urls-configure.md) 

## August 2023

- If the [User reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) in the organization send user reported messages (email and [Microsoft Teams](submissions-teams.md)) to Microsoft (exclusively or in addition to the reporting mailbox), we now do the same checks as when admins submit messages to Microsoft for analysis from the **Submissions** page.
- **Default intra-organizational protection**: By default, messages sent between internal users that are identified as high confidence phishing are quarantined. Admins change this setting in the default anti-spam policy or in custom policies (opt-out of intra-org protection or include other spam filtering verdicts). For configuration information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

## July 2023

- Use anti-phishing policies to control what happens to messages where the sender fails explicit [DMARC](email-authentication-dmarc-configure.md) checks and the DMARC policy is set to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`. For more information, see [Spoof protection and sender DMARC policies](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-protection-and-sender-dmarc-policies).
- [User tags](user-tags-about.md) are now fully integrated with Defender for Office 365 reports, including:
  - [Threat protection status report](reports-email-security.md#threat-protection-status-report)
  - [Compromised users report](reports-email-security.md#compromised-users-report)
  - [Top senders and recipients report](reports-email-security.md#top-senders-and-recipients-report)
  - [URL protection report](reports-email-security.md#url-protection-report)

## May 2023

- Built-in reporting in Outlook on the web supports reporting messages from shared mailboxes or other mailboxes by a delegate.
  - Shared mailboxes require Send As or Send On Behalf permission for the user.
  - Other mailboxes require Send As or Send On Behalf permission _and_ Read and Manage permissions for the delegate.

## April 2023

- [Using machine learning to drive more effective simulations in Attack Simulation and Training](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/attack-simulation-training-using-machine-learning-to-drive-more/ba-p/3791023): Make use of intelligent predicted compromise rate (PCR) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 payload recommendations for utilizing high-quality payloads in your simulation.
- [Training only campaigns available with an expanded library](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/training-only-campaign-is-now-available-with-an-expanded/ba-p/3795237): You can now directly assign training content to your organization without needing to tie training to a phishing simulation campaign. We have also expanded our training module library to more than 70 different modules.

## March 2023

- **Collaboration security for Microsoft Teams**: With the increased use of collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, the possibility of malicious attacks using URLs and messages has increased as well. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is extending its [Safe Links](safe-links-about.md) protection with increased capabilities for zero-hour auto purge (ZAP), quarantine, and end user reporting of potential malicious messages to their admins. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 support for Microsoft Teams (Preview)](mdo-support-teams-about.md).
- **Built-in protection: Safe Links time of click protection enabled for email**: By default, Microsoft now protects URLs in email messages at time of click as part of this update to Safe Links settings (_EnableSafeLinksForEmail_) within the Built-in protection preset security policy. To learn about the specific Safe Links protections in the Built-in protection policy, see [Safe Links policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#safe-links-policy-settings).
- **Quarantine notifications enabled in preset security policies**: If your organization has enabled or will enable the Standard or Strict preset security policies, the policies will be automatically updated to use the new DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy quarantine policy (notifications enabled) wherever the DefaultFullAccessPolicy (notifications disabled) was used. To learn more about quarantine notifications, see [Quarantine notifications](quarantine-quarantine-notifications.md). For more information about specific settings in preset security policies, see [Microsoft recommendations for EOP and Defender for Office 365 security settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md).

## January 2023

- [Automatic Tenant Allow/Block List expiration management is now available in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/automatic-tenant-allow-block-list-expiration-management-is-now/ba-p/3723447): Microsoft now automatically removes allow entries from the Tenant Allow/Block List once the system has learned from it. Alternatively, Microsoft extends the expiration time of the allow entries if the system hasn't learned yet. This behavior prevents legitimate email from going to junk or quarantine.
- **Configuring third-party phishing simulations in Advanced Delivery:** We expanded "Simulation URLs to allow" limit to 30 URLs. To learn how to configure, see [Configure the delivery of third-party phishing simulations to users and unfiltered messages to SecOps mailboxes](advanced-delivery-policy-configure.md)
- [Enhanced user telemetry in the simulation reports in Attack Simulation Training](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/attack-simulation-training-new-insights-into-targeted-user/ba-p/3673105): As part of our enhanced user telemetry, administrators can now view additional details about how their targeted users are interacting with the phishing payload from phishing simulation campaigns.

## December 2022

- The new Microsoft Defender XDR role-based access control (RBAC) model, with support for Microsoft Defender for Office, is now available in public preview. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender XDR role-based access control (RBAC)](../defender/manage-rbac.md).

- [Use the built-in Report button in Outlook on the web](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md#use-the-built-in-report-button-in-outlook-on-the-web): Use the built-in Report button in Outlook on the web to report messages as phish, junk, and not junk.

## October 2022

- [Automated Investigations email cluster action deduplication](air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md): We have added additional checks. If the same investigation cluster is already approved during the past hour, new duplicate remediation isn't processed again.

- [Manage allows and blocks in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md):
  - With **allow expiry management** (currently in Private Preview), if Microsoft hasn't learned from the allow, Microsoft automatically extends the expiry time of allows, which are going to expire soon, by 30 days to prevent legitimate email from going to junk or quarantine again.
  - Customers in government cloud environments are now able to create allow and block entries for URLs and attachments in the Tenant Allow/Block List using admin submissions for URLs and email attachments. The data submitted through the submissions experience doesn't leave the customer tenant, thus satisfying the data residency commitments for government cloud clients.
- **Enhancement in URL click alerts:**
  - With the new lookback scenario, the "A potentially malicious URL click was detected" alert now includes any clicks during the _past 48 hours_ (for email) from the time the malicious URL verdict is identified.

## September 2022

- **Anti-spoofing enhancement for internal domains and senders:**
  - For spoofing protection, the allowed senders or domains defined in the [anti-spam policy](anti-spam-policies-configure.md) and within user allow lists must now pass authentication in order for the allowed messages to be honored. The change only affects messages that are considered to be internal (the sender or sender's domain is in an accepted domain in the organization). All other messages continue to be handled as they are today.

- **Automatic redirection from Office action center to unified action center:** The action center in the Email & Collaboration section **Email & Collaboration** > **Review** > **Action center** (https://security.microsoft.com/threatincidents) is automatically redirected to **Actions & Submissions** > **Action center** > **History** (https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history).

- **Automatic redirection from Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to Microsoft Defender portal:** Automatic redirection begins for users accessing the security solutions in Office 365 Security & Compliance center (protection.office.com) to the appropriate solutions in Microsoft Defender portal (security.microsoft.com). This change is for all security workflows like (for example, Alerts, Threat Management, and Reports).

  - Redirection URLs:
    - GCC Environment:
      - From Office 365 Security & Compliance Center URL: protection.office.com
      - To Microsoft Defender XDR URL: security.microsoft.com
    - GCC-High Environment:
      - From Office 365 Security & Compliance Center URL: scc.office365.us
      - To Microsoft Defender XDR URL: security.microsoft.us
    - DoD Environment:
      - From Office 365 Security & Compliance Center URL: scc.protection.apps.mil
      - To Microsoft Defender XDR URL: security.apps.mil
- Items in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center that aren't related to security aren't redirected to Microsoft Defender XDR. For compliance solutions redirection to Microsoft 365 Compliance Center, see Message Center post 244886.
- This change is a continuation of [Microsoft Defender XDR delivers unified XDR experience to GCC, GCC High and DoD customers - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/public-sector-blog/microsoft-365-defender-delivers-unified-xdr-experience-to-gcc/ba-p/3263702), announced in March 2022.
- This change enables users to view and manage additional Microsoft Defender XDR security solutions in one portal.
- This change impacts all customers who use the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center (protection.office.com), including Microsoft Defender for Office (Plan 1 or Plan 2), Microsoft 365 E3 / E5, Office 365 E3/ E5, and Exchange Online Protection. For the full list, see [Microsoft 365 guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance)
- This change impacts all users who sign in to the Office 365 Security and Compliance portal (protection.office.com), including security teams and end-users who access the Email Quarantine experience, at the **Microsoft Defender Portal** \> **Review** \> **Quarantine**.
- Redirection is enabled by default and impacts all users of the Tenant.
- Global Administrators and Security Administrators can turn on or off redirection in the Microsoft Defender portal by navigating to **Settings** \> **Email & collaboration** > **Portal redirection** and switch the redirection toggle.
- **Built-in protection**: A profile that enables a base level of Safe Links and Safe Attachments protection that's on by default for all Defender for Office 365 customers. To learn more about this new policy and order of precedence, see [Preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md). To learn about the specific Safe Links and Safe Attachment controls that are set, see [Safe Attachments settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#safe-attachments-settings) and [Safe Links policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#safe-links-policy-settings).
- **Bulk Complaint Level** is now available in the EmailEvents table in Advanced Hunting with numeric BCL values from 0 to 9. A higher BCL score indicates that bulk message is more likely to generate complaints and is more likely to be spam.
