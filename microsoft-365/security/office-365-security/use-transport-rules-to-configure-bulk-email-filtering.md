# Use mail flow rules to filter bulk email in EOP

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, EOP uses anti-spam policies (also known as spam filter policies or content filter policies) to scan inbound messages for spam and bulk mail (also known as gray mail). For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

If you want more options to filter bulk mail, you can create mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) to search for text patterns or phrases that are frequently found in bulk mail, and mark those messages as spam. For more information about bulk mail, see [What's the difference between junk email and bulk email?](what-s-the-difference-between-junk-email-and-bulk-email.md) and [Bulk complaint level (BCL) in EOP](bulk-complaint-level-values.md).

This topic explains how create these mail flow rules in the Exchange admin center (EAC) and PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You need to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection before you can do the procedures in this article. Specifically, you need the **Transport Rules** role, which is assigned to the **Organization Management**, **Compliance Management** (global admins), and **Records Management** role groups by default.

  For more information, see the following topics:

  - [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo)
  - [Permissions in standalone EOP](feature-permissions-in-eop.md)
  - [Use the EAC modify the list of members in role groups](manage-admin-role-group-permissions-in-eop.md#use-the-eac-modify-the-list-of-members-in-role-groups)

- To open the EAC in Exchange Online, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](/Exchange/exchange-admin-center). To open the EAC in standalone EOP, see [Exchange admin center in standalone EOP](exchange-admin-center-in-exchange-online-protection-eop.md).

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- For more information about mail flow rules in Exchange Online and standalone EOP, see the following topics:

  - [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules)

  - [Mail flow rule conditions and exceptions (predicates) in Exchange Online](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/conditions-and-exceptions)

  - [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/Exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions)

- The list of words and text patterns that are used to identify bulk mail in the examples aren't exhaustive; you can add and remove entries as necessary. However, they are a good starting point.

- The search for words or text patterns in the subject or other header fields in the message occurs *after* the message has been decoded from the MIME content transfer encoding method that was used to transmit the binary message between SMTP servers in ASCII text. You can't use conditions or exceptions to search for the raw (typically, Base64) encoded values of the subject or other header fields in messages.

- The following procedures mark a bulk message as spam for your entire organization. However, you can add another condition to apply these rules only to specific recipients, so you can use aggressive filtering on a few, highly targeted users, while the rest of your users (who mostly get the bulk email they signed up for) aren't impacted.

## Use the EAC to create mail flow rules that filter bulk email

1. In the EAC, go to **Mail flow** \> **Rules**.

2. Click **Add** ![Add icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.png) and then select **Create a new rule**.

3. In the **New rule** page that opens, configure the following settings:

   - **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the rule.

   - Click **More Options**.

   - **Apply this rule if**: Configure one of the following settings to look for content in messages using regular expressions (RegEx) or words or phrases:

     - **The subject or body** \> **subject or body matches these text patterns**: In the **Specify words or phrases** dialog that appears, enter one of the following values, click **Add** ![Add Icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.png), and repeat until you've entered all the values.

       - `If you are unable to view the content of this email\, please`
       - `\>(safe )?unsubscribe( here)?\</a\>`
       - `If you do not wish to receive further communications like this\, please`
       - `<img height="?1"? width="?1"? src=.?http\://`
       - `To stop receiving these+emails\:http\://`
       - `To unsubscribe from \w+ (e\-?letter|e?-?mail|newsletter)`
       - `no longer (wish )?(to )?(be sent|receive) w+ email`
       - `If you are unable to view the content of this email\, please click here`
       - `To ensure you receive (your daily deals|our e-?mails)\, add`
       - `If you no longer wish to receive these emails`
       - `to change your (subscription preferences|preferences or unsubscribe)`
       - `click (here to|the) unsubscribe`

      To edit an entry, select it and click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-EditIcon.png). To remove an entry, select it and click **Remove** ![Remove icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-DeleteIcon.png).

       When you're finished, click **OK**.

     - **The subject or body** \> **subject or body includes any of these words**: In the **Specify words or phrases** dialog that appears, enter one of the following values, click **Add** ![Add Icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.png), and repeat until you've entered all the values.

       - `to change your preferences or unsubscribe`
       - `Modify email preferences or unsubscribe`
       - `This is a promotional email`
       - `You are receiving this email because you requested a subscription`
       - `click here to unsubscribe`
       - `You have received this email because you are subscribed`
       - `If you no longer wish to receive our email newsletter`
       - `to unsubscribe from this newsletter`
       - `If you have trouble viewing this email`
       - `This is an advertisement`
       - `you would like to unsubscribe or change your`
       - `view this email as a webpage`
       - `You are receiving this email because you are subscribed`

      To edit an entry, select it and click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-EditIcon.png). To remove an entry, select it and click **Remove** ![Remove icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-DeleteIcon.png).

       When you're finished, click **OK**.

   - **Do the following**: Select **Modify the message properties** \> **set the spam confidence level (SCL)**. In the **Specify SCL** dialog that appears, configure one of the following settings:

     - To mark messages as **Spam**, select **6**. The action that you've configured for **Spam** filtering verdicts in your anti-spam policies is applied to the messages (the default value is **Move message to Junk Email folder**).

     - To mark messages as **High confidence spam** select **9**. The action that you've configured for **High confidence spam** filtering verdicts in your anti-spam policies is applied to the messages (the default value is **Move message to Junk Email folder**).

    For more information about SCL values, see [Spam confidence level (SCL) in EOP](spam-confidence-levels.md).

   When you're finished, click **Save**

## Use PowerShell to create mail flow rules that filter bulk email

Use the following syntax to create one or both of the mail flow rules (regular expressions vs. words):

```powershell
New-TransportRule -Name "<UniqueName>" [-SubjectOrBodyMatchesPatterns "<RegEx1>","<RegEx2>"...] [-SubjectOrBodyContainsWords "<WordOrPhrase1>","<WordOrPhrase2>"...] -SetSCL <6 | 9>
```

This example creates a new rule named "Bulk email filtering - RegEx" that uses the same list of regular expressions from earlier in the topic to set messages as **Spam**.

```powershell
New-TransportRule -Name "Bulk email filtering - RegEx" -SubjectOrBodyMatchesPatterns "If you are unable to view the content of this email\, please","\>(safe )?unsubscribe( here)?\</a\>","If you do not wish to receive further communications like this\, please","\<img height\="?1"? width\="?1"? src=.?http\://","To stop receiving these+emails\:http\://","To unsubscribe from \w+ (e\-?letter|e?-?mail|newsletter)","no longer (wish )?(to )?(be sent|receive) w+ email","If you are unable to view the content of this email\, please click here","To ensure you receive (your daily deals|our e-?mails)\, add","If you no longer wish to receive these emails","to change your (subscription preferences|preferences or unsubscribe)","click (here to|the) unsubscribe"... -SetSCL 6
```

This example creates a new rule named "Bulk email filtering - Words" that uses the same list of words from earlier in the topic to set messages as **High confidence spam**.

```powershell
New-TransportRule -Name "Bulk email filtering - Words" -SubjectOrBodyContainsWords "to change your preferences or unsubscribe","Modify email preferences or unsubscribe","This is a promotional email","You are receiving this email because you requested a subscription","click here to unsubscribe","You have received this email because you are subscribed","If you no longer wish to receive our email newsletter","to unsubscribe from this newsletter","If you have trouble viewing this email","This is an advertisement","you would like to unsubscribe or change your","view this email as a webpage","You are receiving this email because you are subscribed" -SetSCL 9
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TransportRule](/powershell/module/exchange/new-transportrule).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've configured mail flow rules to filter bulk email, do any of the following steps:

- In the EAC, go to **Mail flow** \> **Rules** \> select the rule \> click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-EditIcon.png), and verify the settings.

- In PowerShell, replace \<Rule Name\> with the name of the rule, and run the following command to verify the settings:

  ```powershell
  Get-TransportRule -Identity "<Rule Name>" | Format-List
  ```

- From an external account, send a test messages to an affected recipient that contains one of the phrases or text patterns, and verify the results.
