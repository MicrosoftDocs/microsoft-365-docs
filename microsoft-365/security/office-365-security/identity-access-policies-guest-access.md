# Policies for allowing guest access and B2B external user access

This article discusses adjusting the recommended device and identity access policies to allow access for guests and external users that have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Business-to-Business (B2B) account. This guidance builds on the [common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md).

These recommendations are designed to apply to the **baseline** tier of protection. But you can also adjust the recommendations based on your specific needs for **sensitive** and **highly regulated** protection.

Providing a path for B2B accounts to authenticate with your Azure AD tenant doesn't give these accounts access to your entire environment. B2B users and their accounts have access to services and resources, like files, shared with them by Conditional Access policy.

## Updating the common policies to allow and protect guests and external user access

This diagram shows which policies to add or update among the common identity and device access policies, for B2B guest and external user access.

[![Summary of policy updates for protecting guest access.](../../media/microsoft-365-policies-configurations/identity-access-ruleset-guest.png)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/media/microsoft-365-policies-configurations/identity-access-ruleset-guest.png)

The following table lists the policies you either need to create and update. The common policies link to the associated configuration instructions in the [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md) article.

|Protection level|Policies|More information|
|---|---|---|
|**Baseline**|[Require MFA always for guests and external users](identity-access-policies.md#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)|Create this new policy and configure: <ul><li>For **Assignments > Users and groups > Include**, choose **Select users and groups**, and then select **All guest and external users**.</li><li>For **Assignments > Conditions > Sign-in**, leave all options unchecked to always enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li></ul>|
||[Require MFA when sign-in risk is *medium* or *high*](identity-access-policies.md#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)|Modify this policy to exclude guests and external users.|
||[Require compliant PCs](identity-access-policies.md#require-compliant-pcs-but-not-compliant-phones-and-tablets)|Modify this policy to exclude guests and external users.|

To include or exclude guests and external users in Conditional Access policies, for **Assignments > Users and groups > Include** or **Exclude**, check **All guest and external users**.

## More information

### Guests and external user access with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams defines the following users:

- **Guest access** uses an Azure AD B2B account that can be added as a member of a team and have access to the communications and resources of the team.

- **External access** is for an external user that doesn't have a B2B account. External user access includes invitations, calls, chats, and meetings, but doesn't include team membership and access to the resources of the team.

For more information, see the [comparison between guests and external user access for teams](/microsoftteams/communicate-with-users-from-other-organizations#compare-external-and-guest-access).

For more information on securing identity and device access policies for Teams, see [Policy recommendations for securing Teams chats, groups, and files](teams-access-policies.md).

### Require MFA always for guest and external users

This policy prompts guests to register for MFA in your tenant, regardless of whether they're registered for MFA in their home tenant. When accessing resources in your tenant, guests and external users are required to use MFA for every request.

### Excluding guests and external users from risk-based MFA

While organizations can enforce risk-based policies for B2B users using Azure AD Identity Protection, there are limitations in the implementation of Azure AD Identity Protection for B2B collaboration users in a resource directory due to their identity existing in their home directory. Due to these limitations, Microsoft recommends you exclude guests from risk-based MFA policies and require these users to always use MFA.

For more information, see [Limitations of Identity Protection for B2B collaboration users](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-b2b#limitations-of-identity-protection-for-b2b-collaboration-users).

### Excluding guests and external users from device management

Only one organization can manage a device. If you don't exclude guests and external users from policies that require device compliance, these policies will block these users.
