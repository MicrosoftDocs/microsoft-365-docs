# Use the Submissions portal to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes, admins can use the Submissions portal in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to submit email messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft for scanning.

When you submit an email message for analysis, you will get:

- **Email authentication check**: Details on whether email authentication passed or failed when it was delivered.
- **Policy hits**: Information about any policies that may have allowed or blocked the incoming email into your tenant, overriding our service filter verdicts.
- **Payload reputation/detonation**: Up-to-date examination of any URLs and attachments in the message.
- **Grader analysis**: Review done by human graders in order to confirm whether or not messages are malicious.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Payload reputation/detonation and grader analysis are not done in all tenants. Information is blocked from going outside the organization when data is not supposed to leave the tenant boundary for compliance purposes.

For other ways to submit email messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

Watch this short video to learn how to use admin submissions in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to submit messages to Microsoft for evaluation.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/>. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

- To submit messages and files to Microsoft, you need to have one of following roles:
  - **Security Administrator** or **Security Reader** in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md).

    Note that one of these roles is required to [View user submissions to the custom mailbox](#view-user-submissions-to-microsoft) as described later in this article.

- Admins can submit messages as old as 30 days if it is still available in the mailbox and not purged by the user or another admin.

- Admin submissions are throttled at the following rates:
  - Maximum submissions in any 15 minutes period: 150 submissions
  - Same submissions in a 24 hour period: 3 submissions
  - Same submissions in a 15 minute period: 1 submission

- For more information about how users can submit messages and files to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## Report suspicious content to Microsoft

Messages that are submitted in admin submissions are reviewed and results shown in the submissions detail flyout:

- If there was a failure in the sender's email authentication at the time of delivery.
- Information about any policy hits that could have affected or overridden the verdict of a message.
- Current detonation results to see if the URLs or files contained in the message were malicious or not.
- Feedback from graders.

If an override was found, the result should be available in several minutes. If there wasn't a problem in email authentication or delivery wasn't affected by an override, then the feedback from graders could take up to a day.

## View user submissions to Microsoft

If you've deployed the [Report Message add-in](enable-the-report-message-add-in.md), the [Report Phishing add-in](enable-the-report-phish-add-in.md), or people use the [built-in reporting in Outlook on the web](report-junk-email-and-phishing-scams-in-outlook-on-the-web-eop.md), you can see what users are reporting on the **User reported message** tab.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to the **Submissions** page at **Actions & submissions** \> **Submissions**. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

2. On the **Submissions** page, select the **User reported messages** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If organizations are configured to send user reported messages to the custom mailbox only, reported messages will appear in **User reported messages** but their results will always be empty (as they would not have been rescanned).

### Undo user submissions

Once a user submits a suspicious email to the custom mailbox, the user and admin don't have an option to undo the submission. If the user would like to recover the email, it will be available for recovery in the Deleted Items or Junk Email folders.

### Converting user reported messages from the custom mailbox into an admin submission

If you've configured the custom mailbox to intercept user-reported messages without sending the messages to Microsoft, you can find and send specific messages to Microsoft for analysis.

On the **User reported messages** tab, select a message in the list, click **Submit to Microsoft for analysis**, and then select one of the following values from the dropdown list:

- **Report clean**
- **Report phishing**
- **Report malware**
- **Report spam**
- **Trigger investigation**
