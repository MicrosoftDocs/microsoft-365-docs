# Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)


In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, admins can use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center to submit email messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft for scanning.

When you submit an email message, you will get:

1. **Email authentication check**: Details on whether email authentication passed or failed when it was delivered.
2. **Policy hits**: Information about any policies that may have allowed or blocked the incoming email into your tenant, overriding our service filter verdicts.
3. **Payload reputation/detonation**: Examination of any URLs and attachments in the message.
4. **Grader analysis**: Review done by human graders in order to confirm whether or not messages are malicious.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Payload reputation/detonation and grader analysis are not done in all tenants. Information is blocked from going outside the organization when data is not supposed to leave the tenant boundary for compliance purposes.

For other ways to submit email messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Security & Compliance Center at <https://protection.office.com/>. To go directly to the **Submission** page, use <https://protection.office.com/reportsubmission>.

- To submit messages and files to Microsoft, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:

  - **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** in the [Security & Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

  - **Organization Management** in [Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups).

    Note that membership in this role group is required to [View user submissions to the custom mailbox](#view-user-submissions-to-the-custom-mailbox) as described later in this article.

- For more information about how users can submit messages and files to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## Report suspicious content to Microsoft

1. In the Security & Compliance Center, go to **Threat management** \> **Submissions**, verify that you're on the **Admin submissions** tab, and then click **New submission**.

2. Use **New submission** flyout that appears to submit the message, URL, or attachment as described in the following sections.

### Submit a questionable email to Microsoft

1. In the **Object type** section, select **Email**. In the **Submission format** section, use one of the following options:

   - **Network Message ID**: This is a GUID value that's available in the **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Network-Message-Id** header in the message, or in the **X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id** header in quarantined messages.

   - **File**: Click **Choose file**. In the dialog that opens, find and select the .eml or .msg file, and then click **Open**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Admins with Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 are able to submit messages as old as 30 days. Other admins will only be able to go back 7 days.

2. In the **Recipients** section, specify one or more recipients that you would like to run a policy check against. The policy check will determine if the email bypassed scanning due to user or organization policies.

3. In the **Reason for submission** section, select one of the following options:

   - **Should not have been blocked**

   - **Should have been blocked**: Select **Spam**, **Phishing**, or **Malware**. If you're not sure, use your best judgment.

## Undo user submissions

Once a user submits a suspicious email to the custom mailbox, the user and admin don't have an option to undo the submission. If the user would like to recover the email, it will be available for recovery in the Deleted Items or Junk Email folders.

### Submit messages to Microsoft from the custom mailbox

If you've configured the custom mailbox to intercept user-reported messages without sending the messages to Microsoft, you can find and send specific messages to Microsoft for analysis. This effectively moves a user submission to an admin submission.

On the **Custom mailbox** tab, select a message in the list, click the **Action** button, and make one of the following selections:

- **Report clean**
- **Report phishing**
- **Report malware**
- **Report spam**
