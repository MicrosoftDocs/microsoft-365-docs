# Find and release quarantined messages as a user in EOP

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages. For more information, see [Quarantine in EOP](quarantine-email-messages.md).

As a recipient of a quarantined message, what you can do to the message as an ordinary use (not an admin) is described in the following table:

<br>

****

|Quarantine reason|View|Release|Delete|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bulk|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|Spam|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|Phishing (not high confidence phishing)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|

You view and manage your quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or (if an admin has set this up) in [end-user spam notifications](use-spam-notifications-to-release-and-report-quarantined-messages.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to <https://security.microsoft.com>. To open the **Quarantine** page directly, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

- Admins can configure how long messages are kept in quarantine before they're permanently deleted in anti-spam policies. Messages that have expired from quarantine are unrecoverable. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

- Admins can also [enable end-user spam notifications](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md#configure-end-user-spam-notifications) in anti-spam policies. Original message recipients can *release* quarantined spam messages directly from these notifications. Original message recipients can *review* quarantined phishing messages (not high confidence phishing messages) directly from these notifications. For more information, see [End-user spam notifications in EOP](use-spam-notifications-to-release-and-report-quarantined-messages.md).

- Messages that were quarantined for high confidence phishing, malware, or by mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) are only available to admins, and aren't visible to users. For more information, see [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP](manage-quarantined-messages-and-files.md).

- You can only release a message and report it as a false positive (not junk) once.
