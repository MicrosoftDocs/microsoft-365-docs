# The Teams Message Entity Panel for Microsoft Teams in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

The Teams Message Entity Panel in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 puts all Microsoft Teams data about suspicious or malicious chats and channels on a *single, actionable panel*.

The Teams Message Entity Panel is the single source of Teams message metadata for Security Operations team (SecOps) review. In other words, any threat coming from:

- chats
- meeting chats
- group chats

can be seen and reviewed in one place.

## Using the Teams Message Entity Panel in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

The Teams Message Entity Panel will be available for customers with E5 and P2 subscriptions across all experiences, including:

- Quarantine
- Submissions
- Reporting

The steps to use the Teams Message Entity Panel remain the same wherever you find Teams message details.

- Navigate to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
- Select **Email & collaboration** > **Quarantine**.

Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use [this link](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine).

- In **Quarantine**, select **Teams messages**.
- Select the subject of an email you're investigating.

The Teams Message Entity Panel for that message will open.

> [!NOTE]
> The permissions needed to view and use this page are the same as to view **Quarantine** and **Submissions**. SecOps users must also be a member of Global Admin or Global Reader, or Security Admin or Security Reader. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md).


## Teams Message Entity Panel Walkthrough

The panel is designed for easy use.

Clicking on a Teams message across any Microsoft Defender for Office 365 experience opens the Teams Message Entity Panel.

The **header section** contains the subject of the message (if there is one) or it displays the first 100 characters of the body of the message. The current verdict of the message can also be found there, as well as a count of URLs present in the message.

The **message details** section contains the threats suspected, confidence level, and the message location. This is also the location where admins can view the sender address, the time the message was recieved and the detection technology. It also includes the Teams Message ID, which can be used as an indentifer of a Teams message in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. 

The **sender section** displays the sender's domain and reports whether the sender is in the tenant or cross-org. An external section marked as *Yes* indicates that the message happened between a user inside, and a user outside, of your organization.

The **participants section** includes information like the conversation type, chat name, and the name and email addresses of all of the participants (including the sender). It also links to a secondary panel that lists all the participants in the chat at the time of the suspected threat (this only appears if there are more than 10 participants).

The **URLs section** displays the URL extracted from the Teams message and the threat associated with the URL. It also links to a secondary panel that lists all the URLs in the chat and their associated threats (this only appears if there are more than 10 URLs).
