    questions:
      - question: |
          What is EOP?
        answer: |
          EOP is a cloud-hosted email filtering service that's built to protect customers from spam and malware, and to implement custom policy rules. EOP is included in any Microsoft 365 subscription that contains Exchange Online mailboxes. EOP is also available as a standalone offering to help protect on-premises email environments.

      - question: |
          How do I sign up for an EOP trial or purchase EOP?
        answer: |
          Sign up for an EOP trial or purchase EOP via the web at the [Exchange Online Protection home page](https://products.office.com/exchange/exchange-email-security-spam-protection). The functionality of a trial is the same as a paid subscription.

      - question: |
          How is EOP priced?
        answer: |
          EOP is licensed by user. For the latest pricing information, see the [Exchange Online Protection home page](https://products.office.com/exchange/exchange-email-security-spam-protection).

      - question: |
          How long does it take to put EOP into production?
        answer: |
          When you change your MX record per the steps in [Set up your EOP service](/exchange/standalone-eop/set-up-your-eop-service), filtering begins when your mail flows through EOP. The MX record might take 24 to 48 hours to propagate throughout internet DNS. You can fine tune your protection settings at any time during this process.

      - question: |
          Do I have to use all features of Microsoft 365 to use EOP? What if I just want EOP protection and that's all?
        answer: |
          You can use EOP to protect your on-premises mailboxes without using any other features of Microsoft 365, including Microsoft Defender for Office 365. A list of EOP features can be found in the [Exchange Online Protection Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-service-description).

      - question: |
          Why do I need a Microsoft 365 tenant when signing up for email filtering through EOP?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 is the name given to a collection of products and services. Think of the Microsoft 365 tenant as the starting point where you add licenses for email filtering.

      - question: |
          Does EOP have a communication portal where I can find out about known issues and expected resolutions? What about new features?
        answer: |
          Yes.
          
          - If you're affected by a Service Level Event, you should see a communication alert (typically accompanied by a bell icon) in the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com>. We recommend that you read and act on any items as appropriate.
          - The Microsoft 365 Message center at <https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter> also contains information about new and updated features. For more information, see [Track new and changed features in the Microsoft 365 Message center](../../admin/manage/message-center.md).
          - The [Microsoft 365 for business roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=O365) is a good resource for finding out information about upcoming new features.
          - We also posting blog articles about new features to the [Microsoft 365 Blogs](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/) website.

      - question: |
          Does the service work with legacy Exchange versions (such as Exchange Server) and non-Exchange environments?
        answer: |
          Yes, the service is server agnostic and can be used with any SMTP mail transfer agent.

      - question: |
          What size organization can use the service?
        answer: |
          Any size. EOP has sufficient capacity to accommodate your growth, no matter how fast your organization grows.

      - question: |
          What permissions do I need to set up EOP?
        answer: |
          To configure EOP, you need to be a global admin, or an Exchange Company Administrator (the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online).

      - question: |
          How do I know my data and private information are safe?
        answer: |
          To learn more about the steps we've taken to ensure the safety of your data and private information, including information about Service Level Agreements (SLAs), go to the [Office 365 Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

      - question: |
          Are there any limits I should be aware of, such as message size limitations?
        answer: |
          Yes. For more information about limits in EOP, see [Exchange Online Protection Limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-limits).

      - question: |
          Does EOP support PowerShell?
        answer: |
          Yes, full EOP functionality is available via PowerShell: Exchange Online PowerShell for organizations with Exchange Online Mailboxes; standalone EOP PowerShell for standalone EOP organizations. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell) and [Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-protection-powershell).
