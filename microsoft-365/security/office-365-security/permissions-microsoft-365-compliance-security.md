# Permissions in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center

Your organization needs to manage security and compliance scenarios that span all the Microsoft 365 services. And you need the flexibility to give the right admin permissions to the right people in your organization's IT group. By using the Microsoft 365 security center or Microsoft 365 compliance center, you can manage permissions centrally for all tasks related to security or compliance.

After the global administrator assigns these admin roles, the admins have access to features and data that span all services in Microsoft 365, such as the Microsoft 365 security center, Microsoft 365 compliance center, Azure, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

## What the Microsoft 365 roles are

The roles that appear in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center are Azure Active Directory roles. These roles are designed to align with job functions in your organization's IT group, making it easy to give a person all the permissions necessary to get their job done.

****

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|**Global administrator**|Users with this role have access to all administrative features in all Microsoft 365 services. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles.|
|**Compliance data administrator**|Users with this role can keep track of your organization's data across Microsoft 365, make sure it's protected, and get insights into any issues to help mitigate risks.|
|**Compliance administrator**|Users with this role can help your organization stay compliant with any regulatory requirements, manage eDiscovery cases, and maintain data governance policies across Microsoft 365 locations, identities, and apps.|
|**Security operator**|Users with this role can view, investigate, and respond to active threats to your Microsoft 365 users, devices, and content.|
|**Security reader**|Users with this role can view and investigate active threats to your Microsoft 365 users, devices, and content, but (unlike the Security operator) they do not have permissions to respond by taking action.|
|**Security administrator**|Users with this role can control your organization's overall security by managing security policies, reviewing security analytics and reports across Microsoft 365 products, and staying up-to-speed on the threat landscape.|
|

## What the Microsoft 365 roles have access to

Here are the available roles and what people assigned to them can do.

### Global administrator

Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure Active Directory, as well as services that use Azure Active Directory identities like Microsoft 365 security center, Microsoft 365 compliance center, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online. The person who signs up for the Azure Active Directory tenant becomes a global administrator. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles. There can be more than one global administrator at your company. Global admins can reset the password for any user and all other administrators.

### Compliance administrator

Users with this role have permissions to manage compliance-related features in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, Azure, and Security & Compliance Center. Users can also manage all features within the Exchange admin center and Teams & Skype for Business admin center and create support tickets for Azure and Microsoft 365.

## Global administrators can manage roles in Azure Active Directory

In the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center, when you select a role, you can view its assignments. But to manage those assignments, you need to go to the Azure Active Directory.

For more information, see [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-manage-roles-portal).

## Managing roles in a service instead of Azure Active Directory

The roles that appear in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center also appear in the services where they have permissions. For example, you can see these roles in the Security & Compliance Center.

![Roles in Security & Compliance Center](../../media/m365-roles-in-o365-scc.png)

### Breaking inheritance

It's important to understand that you when you manage these roles in Azure Active Directory, you're doing so centrally for **all** Microsoft 365 services. However, when you manage a role in a specific service, such as the Security & Compliance Center, you're managing the role for **only** that specific service. The assignments and permissions for a role in a service override any permissions granted to the Azure Active Directory role.

This can be useful – for example, if a person is assigned to the Security administrator role, they don't have permissions to manage incidents. But you can use the permissions in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to give them the specific permission for incident management in that service.

## Where to find role information for each Microsoft 365 service

By assigning a user to one of the Microsoft 365 compliance or security admin roles, you give that user permissions to a range of Microsoft 365 services. Use the links below to find more information about the specific permissions for a role in each service.

## What is coming soon

We're still working on permissions in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center. For example, we're currently working on support for the ability to:

- Manage roles in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Microsoft 365 security center, instead of going to Azure Active Directory.

- Customize roles by adding or removing specific permissions.

- Create custom roles with permissions that you choose.
