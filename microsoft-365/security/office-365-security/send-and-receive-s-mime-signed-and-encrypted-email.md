# Send and receive S/MIME signed and encrypted email in Exchange Online

Sending or replying to an S/MIME-encrypted message in Microsoft Outlook is very similar to the experience with a non-encrypted message. For more information about reading or sending S/MIME-encrypted messages from an email program such as Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App), see [Encrypt messages by using S/MIME in Outlook on the web](https://support.microsoft.com/office/878c79fc-7088-4b39-966f-14512658f480).
