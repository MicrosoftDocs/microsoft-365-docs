# Remediation actions in Microsoft 365

## Remediation actions

[Automated investigation and response capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-air) (AIR) in [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp) (Office 365 ATP) Plan 2 include certain remediation actions. Whenever an automated investigation is running or has completed, you'll typically see one or more remediation actions that require approval by your security operations team to proceed. Such remediation actions can include the following:

- Soft delete email messages or clusters
- Block URL (time-of-click)
- Turn off external mail forwarding
- Turn off delegation

> [!NOTE]
> In Office 365 ATP, automated investigations do not automatically remediate. Remediation actions are taken only upon approval by your organization's security team.

## Threats and remediation actions

The following table summarizes threats and appropriate remediation actions in Office 365 ATP. In some cases, an automated investigation does not result in a specific remediation action. Your security operations team can further investigate and take appropriate actions as described in the table below.

****

|Category|Threat/risk|Remediation action(s)|
|---|---|---|
|Email|Malware|Soft delete email/cluster​ <br/><br/>If more than a handful of email messages in a cluster contain malware, the cluster is considered to be malicious.​|
|Email|Malicious URL​<br/>(A malicious URL was detected by [Office 365 ATP Safe Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-atp-safe-links-works).)|Soft delete email/cluster​ <br/><br/>Email that contains a malicious URL is considered to be malicious​.|
|Email|Phish|Soft delete email/cluster​ <br/><br/>If more than a handful of email messages in a cluster contain phishing attempts, the cluster is considered to be phish.​|
|Email|Zapped phish​ <br/>(Email messages were delivered and [zapped​](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/zero-hour-auto-purge).)|Soft delete email/cluster​ <br/><br/>Reports are available to view zapped messages. [See if ZAP moved a message and FAQs](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/zero-hour-auto-purge#how-to-see-if-zap-moved-your-message).|

|Email|Volume anomaly​ <br/>(Recent email quantities exceed the previous 7-10 days for matching criteria.​)|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>Volume anomaly is not a clear threat, but is merely an indication of larger email volumes in recent days compared to the last 7-10 days. Although this can indicate potential issues, confirmation is needed in terms of either malicious verdicts or a manual review of email messages/clusters. See [Find and delete suspicious email that was delivered](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/investigate-malicious-email-that-was-delivered#find-and-delete-suspicious-email-that-was-delivered).|
|Email|No threats found <br/>(The system did not find any threats based on files, urls, or analysis of email cluster verdicts.​)|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>Threats found and [zapped](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/zero-hour-auto-purge) after an investigation is complete are not reflected in an investigation's numerical findings, but such threats are viewable in [Threat Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/threat-explorer).​|
|User|A user clicked a malicious URL <br/>(A user navigated to a page that was later found to be malicious, or a user bypassed a [Safe Links warning page](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links-warning-pages) to get to a malicious page.​)|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>Use Threat Explorer to [view data about URLs and click verdicts](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/threat-explorer#view-data-about-phishing-urls-and-click-verdict). <br/><br/>If your organization is using [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/), consider [investigating the user](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/investigate-user) to determine if their account is compromised.|
|User|A user is sending malware/phish|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>The user might be reporting malware/phish, or someone could be [spoofing the user](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-spoofing-protection) as part of an attack. Use [Threat Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/threat-explorer) to view and handle email containing [malware](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/threat-explorer-views#email--malware) or [phish](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/threat-explorer-views#email--phish).|
|User|Email forwarding <br/>(Mailbox forwarding rules are configured, which could be used for data exfiltration​.)|Remove forwarding rule​ <br/><br/>Use [mail flow insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mail-flow-insights-v2), including the [Auto-forwarded messages report](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-auto-forwarded-messages-report), to view more specific details about forwarded email.|
|User|Email delegation rules​ <br/>(A user's account has delegation set up.)|Remove delegation rule​ <br/><br/> If your organization is using [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/), consider [investigating the user](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/investigate-user) who's getting the delegation permission.​|
|User|Data exfiltration<br/>(A user violated email or file-sharing [DLP policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/data-loss-prevention-policies).)|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>[View DLP reports and take action](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/view-the-dlp-reports).|
|User|Anomalous email sending <br/>(A user recently sent more email than during the previous 7-10 days.)|Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action. <br/><br/>Sending a lot of email isn't malicious by itself; the user might just have sent email to a large group of recipients for an event. To investigate, use [mail flow insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mail-flow-insights-v2), including the [mail flow map report](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-mail-flow-map-report) to determine what's going on and take action.|
