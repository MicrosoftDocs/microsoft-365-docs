# View Defender for Office 365 reports in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 (for example, Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Business Premium) a variety of security-related reports are available. If you have the [necessary permissions](#what-permissions-are-needed-to-view-the-defender-for-office-365-reports), you can view and download these reports in the Microsoft Defender portal.

The reports are available in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com> on the **Email & collaboration reports** page at **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. Or, to go directly to the **Email & collaboration reports** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>.

Summary information for each report is available on the page. Identify the report you want to view, and then select **View details** for that report.

The rest of this article describes the reports that are exclusive to Defender for Office 365.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Email security reports that don't require Defender for Office 365 are described in [View email security reports in the Microsoft Defender portal](reports-email-security.md).
>
> For reports that have been deprecated or replaced, see the table in [Email security report changes in the Microsoft Defender portal](reports-email-security.md#email-security-report-changes-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal).
>
> Reports that are related to mail flow are now in the Exchange admin center (EAC). For more information about these reports, see [Mail flow reports in the new Exchange admin center](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mail-flow-reports).

Watch this short video to learn how you can use reports to understand the effectiveness of Defender for Office 365 in your organization.

## Safe Attachments file types report

> [!NOTE]
> This report has been deprecated. The same information is available in the [Threat protection status report](#threat-protection-status-report).

## Mail latency report

The **Mail latency report** shows you an aggregate view of the mail delivery and detonation latency experienced within your Defender for Office 365 organization. Mail delivery times in the service are affected by many factors, and the absolute delivery time in seconds is often not a good indicator of success or a problem. A slow delivery time on one day might be considered an average delivery time on another day, or vice-versa. This report tries to qualify message delivery based on statistical data about the observed delivery times of other messages.

Client side and network latency aren't included.

On the **Email & collaboration reports** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>, find **Mail latency report**, and then select **View details**. Or, to go directly to the report, use <https://security.microsoft.com/mailLatencyReport>.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mail-latency-report-widget.png" alt-text="The Mail latency report widget on the Email & collaboration reports page" lightbox="../../media/mail-latency-report-widget.png":::

On the **Mail latency report** page, the following tabs are available:

- **50th percentile**: The middle for message delivery times. You can consider this value as an average delivery time. This tab is selected by default.
- **90th percentile**: Indicates a high latency for message delivery. Only 10% of messages took longer than this value to deliver.
- **99th percentile**: Indicates the highest latency for message delivery.

Regardless of the tab you select, the chart shows messages organized into the following categories:

- **Overall**
- **Detonation** (these values are explained in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** values)

Hover over a category in the chart to see a breakdown of the latency in each category.

In the details table below the chart, the following information is available:

- **Date (UTC)**

    - **Asynchronous detonation**: [Dynamic delivery](safe-attachments-about.md#dynamic-delivery-in-safe-attachments-policies) of attachments in Safe Attachments and links in email tested after delivery by Safe Links.

When you're finished configuring the filters, select **Apply**, **Cancel**, or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear filters**.

The report shows real-time information, with updated threat information.

On the **Email & collaboration reports** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>, find **Post-delivery activities**, and then select **View details**. Or, to go directly to the report, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reports/ZapReport>.
