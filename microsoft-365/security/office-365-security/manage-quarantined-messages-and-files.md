# Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP](quarantine-email-messages.md).

Admins can view, release, and delete all types of quarantined messages for all users. Only admins can manage messages that were quarantined as malware, high confidence phishing, or as a result of mail flow rules (also known as transport rules). Admins can also report false positives to Microsoft.

Admins in organizations with Office 365 Advance Threat Protection (Office 365 ATP) can also view, download, and delete quarantined files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams.

You view and manage quarantined messages in the Security & Compliance Center or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Security & Compliance Center, go to <https://protection.office.com>. To open the Quarantine page directly, go to <https://protection.office.com/quarantine>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can manage the quarantine as an admin. The permissions are controlled by the **Quarantine** role in the Security & Compliance Center. By default, this role is assigned to the **Organization Management** (Global admins), **Quarantine Administrator**, and **Security Administrator** role groups in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

- Quarantined messages are retained for a default period of time before they're automatically deleted:

  - Messages quarantined by anti-spam policies (spam, phishing, and bulk email): 30 days. This is the default and maximum value. To configure this value, see [Configure anti-spam policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

  - Messages that contain malware: 15 days.

  When a message expires from quarantine, you can't recover it.

## Use the Security & Compliance Center to manage quarantined email messages

### View quarantined email

1. In the Security and Compliance Center, go to **Threat Management** \> **Review** \> **Quarantine**.

2. Verify that **View quarantined** is set to the default value **email**.

3. You can sort the results by clicking on an available column header. Click **Modify columns** to show a maximum of seven columns. The default values are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):

   - **Received**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Sender**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Subject**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Quarantine reason**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Released?**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Policy type**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Recipient**

   - **Message ID**

   - **Policy name**

   - **Size**

   - **Direction**

   When you're finished, click **Save**, or click **Set to default**.

4. To filter the results, click **Filter**. The available filters are:

   - **Expires time**: Filter messages by when they will expire from quarantine:

     - **Today**

     - **Next 2 days**

     - **Next 7 days**

     - **Custom**: Enter a **Start date** and **End date**.

   - **Received time**: Enter a **Start date** and **End date**.

   - **Quarantine reason**:

     - **Policy**: The message matched the conditions of a mail flow rule (also known as a transport rule).

     - **Bulk**

     - **Phish**

     - **Malware**

     - **Spam**

     - **High Confidence Phish**

   - **Email recipient**: All users or only messages sent to you. End users can only manage quarantined messages sent to them.

   To clear the filter, click **Clear**. To hide the filter flyout, click **Filter** again.

5. Use **Sort results by** (the **Message ID** button by default) and a corresponding value to find specific messages. Wildcards aren't supported. You can search by the following values:

   - **Message ID**: The globally unique identifier of the message.

     For example, you used [message trace](message-trace-scc.md) to look for a message that was sent to a user in your organization, and you determine that the message was quarantined instead of delivered. Be sure to include the full message ID value, which might include angle brackets (\<\>). For example: `<79239079-d95a-483a-aacf-e954f592a0f6@XYZPR00BM0200.contoso.com>`.

   - **Sender email address**: A single sender's email address.

   - **Recipient email address**: A single recipient's email address.

   - **Subject**: Use the entire subject of the message. The search is not case-sensitive.

   After you've entered the search criteria, click ![Refresh button](../../media/scc-quarantine-refresh.png) **Refresh** to filter the results.

After you find a specific quarantined message, select the message to view details about it, and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).

#### Export message results

1. Select the messages you're interested in, and click **Export results**.

2. Click **Yes** in the confirmation message that warns you to keep the browser window open.

3. When your export is ready, you can name and choose the download location for the .csv file.

#### View quarantined message details

When you select an email message in the list, the following message details appear in the **Details** flyout pane:

- **Message ID**: The globally unique identifier for the message.

- **Sender address**

- **Received**: The date/time when the message was received.

- **Subject**

- **Quarantine reason**: Shows if a message has been identified as **Spam**, **Bulk**, **Phish**, matched a mail flow rule (**Transport rule**), or was identified as containing **Malware**.

- **Recipients**: If the message contains multiple recipients, you need to click **Preview message** or **View message header** to see the complete list of recipients.

- **Expires**: The date/time when the message will be automatically and permanently deleted from quarantine.

- **Released to**: All email addresses (if any) to which the message has been released.

- **Not yet released to**: All email addresses (if any) to which the message has not yet been released.

### Take action on quarantined email

After you select a message, you have several options for what to do with the messages in the **Details** flyout pane:

- **Release message**: In the flyout pane that appears, choose the following options:

  - **Report messages to Microsoft for analysis**: This is selected by default, and reports the erroneously quarantined message to Microsoft as a false positive. If the message was quarantined as spam, bulk, phishing, or containing malware, the message is also reported to the Microsoft Spam Analysis Team. Depending on their analysis, the service-wide spam filter rules might be be adjusted to allow the message through.

  - Choose one of the following options:

    - **Release messages to all recipients**

    - **Release messages to specific recipients**

    - **Release messages to other people**

  When you're finished, click **Release messages**.

  Notes about releasing messages:

  - You can't release a message to the same recipient more than once.

  - Only recipients who haven't received the message will appear in the list of potential recipients.

- **View message header**: Choose this link to see the message header text. To analyze the header fields and values in depth, copy the message header text to your clipboard, and then choose **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer** to go to the Remote Connectivity Analyzer (right-click and choose **Open in a new tab** if you don't want to leave Microsoft 365 to complete this task). Paste the message header onto the page in the Message Header Analyzer section, and choose **Analyze headers**:

- **Preview message**: In the flyout pane that appears, choose one of the following options:

  - **Source view**: Shows the HTML version of the message body with all links disabled.
  
  - **Text view**: Shows the message body in plain text.

- **Remove from quarantine**: After you click **Yes** in the warning that appears, the message is immediately deleted without being sent to the original recipients.

- **Download message**: In the flyout pane that appears, select **I understand the risks from downloading this message** to save a local copy of the message in .eml format.

- **Submit message**: In the flyout pane that appears, choose the following options:

  - **Object type**: **Email** (default), **URL**, or **Attachment**.

  - **Submission format**: **Network Message ID** (default, with the corresponding value in the **Network Message ID** box) or **File** (browse to a local .eml or .msg file). Note that if you select **File** and then select **Network Message ID**, the initially value is gone.

  - **Recipients**: Type at lease one original recipient of the message, or click **Select All** to identify all recipients. You can also click **Select All** and then selectively remove individual recipients.

  - **Reason for submission**: **Should not have been blocked** (default) or **Should have been blocked**.

  When you're finished, click **Submit**.

If you don't release or remove the message, it will be deleted after the default quarantine retention period expires.

#### Take action on multiple quarantined email messages

When you select multiple quarantined messages in the list (up to 100), the **Bulk actions** flyout pane appears where you can take the following actions:

- **Release messages**: The options are the same as when you release a single message, except you can't select **Release messages to specific recipients**; you can only select **Release message to all recipients** or **Release messages to other people**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Consider the following scenario: john@gmail.com sends a message to faith@contoso.com and john@subsidiary.contoso.com. Gmail bifurcates this message into two copies that are both routed to quarantine as phishing in Microsoft. An admin releases both of these messages to admin@contoso.com. The first released message that reaches the admin mailbox is delivered. The second released message is identified as duplicate delivery and is skipped. Message are identified as duplicates if they have the same message ID and received time.

- **Delete messages**:  After you click **Yes** in the warning that appears, the message are immediately deleted without being sent to the original recipients.

When you're finished, click **Close**.
