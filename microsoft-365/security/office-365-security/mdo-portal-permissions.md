# Microsoft Defender for Office 365 permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Global roles in Microsoft Entra ID allow you to manage permissions and access to capabilities in all of Microsoft 365, which also includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365. But, if you need to limit permissions and capabilities to security features in Defender for Office 365 only, you can assign **Email & collaboration** permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal.

To manage Defender for Office 365 permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal, go to **Permissions** \> **Email & collaboration roles** \> **Roles** or go directly to <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabpermissions>.

You need to be member of the **Global Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID or a member of the **Organization Management** role group in Defender for Office 365 permissions. Specifically, the **Role Management** role in Defender for Office 365 allows users to view, create, and modify Defender for Office 365 role groups. By default, that role is assigned only to the **Organization Management** role group (and by extension, global administrators).

> [!NOTE]
> Some Defender for Office 365 features require additional permissions in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).
>
> Microsoft Defender XDR has its own Unified role-based access control (RBAC). This model provides a single permissions management experience in one central location where admins can control permissions across different security solutions. These permissions are different from the permissions described in this article. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender XDR role-based access control (RBAC)](../defender/manage-rbac.md).
>
> **If you activate Defender XDR RBAC for Email & collaboration, the permissions page at <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabpermissions> is no loger available in the Defender portal**.
>
> For information about permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## Relationship of members, roles, and role groups

Defender for Office 365 permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model. RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by most Microsoft 365 services, so if you're familiar with the permission structure in these services, granting permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal should be familiar.

A **role** grants the permissions to do a set of tasks.

A **role group** is a set of roles that lets people do their jobs in the Microsoft Defender portal.

Defender for Office 365 permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal includes default role groups for the most common tasks and functions that you need to assign. Generally, we recommend simply adding individual users as **members** to the default role groups.

## Roles and role groups in the Microsoft Defender portal

On the **Permissions** page in the Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/securitypermissions>, the following types of roles and role groups are available:

- **Microsoft Entra roles**: You can view the roles and assigned users, but you can't manage them directly in the Microsoft Defender portal. Microsoft Entra roles are central roles that assign permissions for **all** Microsoft 365 services.

- **Email & collaboration roles**: You can view and manage these role groups directly in the Microsoft Defender portal. These permissions are specific to the Microsoft Defender portal and the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. These permissions don't cover all of the permissions that you need in other Microsoft 365 workloads.

### Microsoft Entra roles in the Microsoft Defender portal

Microsoft Entra roles that are described in this section are available in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) \> **Permissions** \> **Microsoft Entra ID** \> **Roles** or directly at <https://security.microsoft.com/aadpermissions>.

When you select a role, a details flyout opens that contains the description of the role and the user assignments. But to manage those assignments, you need to select **Manage members in Microsoft Entra ID** at the bottom of the flyout.

For more information, see [Assign Microsoft Entra roles to users](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal) and [Manage access to Microsoft Defender XDR with Microsoft Entra global roles](/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-permissions).

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|**Global Administrator**|Access to all administrative features in all Microsoft 365 services. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles. For more information, see [Global Administrator / Company Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator--company-administrator).|
|**Compliance Data Administrator**|Keep track of your organization's data across Microsoft 365, make sure it's protected, and get insights into any issues to help mitigate risks. For more information, see [Compliance Data Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#compliance-data-administrator).|
|**Compliance Administrator**|Help your organization stay compliant with any regulatory requirements, manage eDiscovery cases, and maintain data governance policies across Microsoft 365 locations, identities, and apps. For more information, see [Compliance Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#compliance-administrator).|
|**Security Operator**|View, investigate, and respond to active threats to your Microsoft 365 users, devices, and content. For more information, see [Security Operator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-operator).|
|**Security Reader**|View and investigate active threats to your Microsoft 365 users, devices, and content, but (unlike the Security operator) they don't have permissions to respond by taking action. For more information, see [Security Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-reader).|
|**Security Administrator**|Control your organization's overall security by managing security policies, reviewing security analytics and reports across Microsoft 365 products, and staying up-to-speed on the threat landscape. For more information, see [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator).|
|**Global Reader**|The read-only version of the **Global administrator** role. View all settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader).|
|**Attack Simulation Administrator**|Create and manage all aspects of [attack simulation](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md) creation, launch/scheduling of a simulation, and the review of simulation results. For more information, see [Attack Simulation Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attack-simulation-administrator).|
|**Attack Payload Author**|Create attack payloads but not actually launch or schedule them. For more information, see [Attack Payload Author](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attack-payload-author).|
