# Report junk and phishing email in Outlook for iOS and Android in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or on-premises mailboxes using [hybrid modern authentication](../../enterprise/hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md), you can submit false positives (good email marked as spam), false negatives (bad email allowed), and phishing messages to Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

## What do you need to know before you begin

- For the best user submission experience we recommend using the Report Message and the Report Phishing add-ins. See [Enable the Report Message add-in](./enable-the-report-message-add-in.md) and [Enable the Report Phishing add-in](./enable-the-report-phish-add-in.md) for more information.

- If you're an admin in an organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

- You can configure reported messages to be copied or redirected to a mailbox that you specify. For more information, see [User Submissions policies](user-submission.md).

- For more information about reporting messages to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If junk email reporting is disabled for Outlook in the user submission policy, junk or phishing messages will be moved to the Junk folder and not reported to your admin or Microsoft.
