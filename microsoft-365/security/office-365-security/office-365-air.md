# Automatically investigate and respond to threats in Office 365

## Overview

Depending on your subscription, [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md) can include automated incident response (AIR) capabilities that can save your security operations team time and effort in dealing with alerts and threats.

- To get started using AIR capabilities in Office 365, use this article. 
- To get an overview of how AIR works, see [Automated incident response (AIR) in Office 365](automated-investigation-response-office.md).

With AIR, when certain alerts are triggered, one or more security playbooks initiate, and automated investigation begins. During and after an automated investigation process, your administrators and security operations team can:

- [View the details of an investigation](#view-details-of-an-investigation)
- [Review and approve actions as a result of an investigation](#review-and-approve-actions) 
- [View details about an alert related to an investigation](#view-details-about-an-alert-related-to-an-investigation)

## View details of an investigation

1. As an Office 365 global administrator, security administrator, or security reader, go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) and sign in. This takes you to the the Security & Compliance Center.

2. Do one of the following:

    - Go to **Threat management** > **Dashboard**. This takes you to the [Security Dashboard](security-dashboard.md). Your AIR widgets appear across the top of the [Security Dashboard](security-dashboard.md). Select a widget, such as **Investigations summary**.

    - Go to **Threat management** > **Investigations**. 

    Either method takes you to a list of investigations.

3. In the list of investigations, select an item in the **ID** column. This opens investigation details page, starting with the investigation graph in view.

4. Use the various tabs to learn more about the investigation.

## Review and approve actions

In Office 365, automated investigations typically result in one or more recommended actions. However, no actions are taken until they are approved by your security operations team. Use the following procedure to review and approve actions.

1. As an Office 365 global administrator, security administrator, or security reader, go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) and sign in. 

2. Go to **Threat management** > **Investigations**.

3. In the list of investigations, select an item in the **ID** column. 

3. On the investigation details view, select the **Actions** tab. Any actions that are pending approval are listed here.

4. Select an item in the list.

5. Select **Approve** to take the recommended action (or **Reject** to close the investigation without taking action).

## View details about an alert related to an investigation

Certain kinds of alerts trigger automated investigation in Office 365. To learn more, see [Alerts](automated-investigation-response-office.md#alerts). Use the following procedure to view details about an alert that is associated with an automated investigation.

1. As an Office 365 global administrator, security administrator, or security reader, go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) and sign in. This takes you to the the Security & Compliance Center.

2. Go to **Threat management** > **Investigations**.

3. In the list of investigations, select an item in the **ID** column. 

4. With details of an investigation open, select the **Alerts** tab. Any alerts that triggered the investigation are listed here.

5. Select an item in the list. A flyout opens, with details about the alert and links to additional information and actions.

6. Review the information on the flyout, and, depending on the particular alert, take an action, such as **Resolve**, **Suppress**, or **Notify users**. 

    - **Resolve** is equivalent to closing an alert
    
    - **Suppress** causes a policy to not trigger alerts for a specified period of time
    
    - **Notify users** starts an email with users' email addresses already entered, and enables your security operations team to type a message to those users. (This is similar to sending a message to recipients using [Threat Explorer](threat-explorer.md).)  

## Use the Office 365 Management Activity API for custom or third-party reporting solutions

If your organization is using a custom or third-party reporting solution, you can view information about automated investigations in that solution by using the Office 365 Management Activity API.

Use the following resources to set this up:
