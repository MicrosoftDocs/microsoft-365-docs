    questions:
      - question: |
          Why is mail queuing?
        answer: |
          Messages are queued or deferred if the service is unable to make a connection to the destination server for delivery. Messages aren't deferred if a 500-series (permanent) error is returned from the destination server.

      - question: |
          How does a message become deferred?
        answer: |
          Messages are held when a connection to the destination server can't be made, and the destination server returns temporary) errors. For example, connection time-out, connection refused, or other 400-series errors. 500-series (permanent) errors result in return of the message in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message).

      - question: |
          How long does a message remain in deferral and what is the retry interval?
        answer: |
          Deferred messages remain in our queues for one day. Retry attempts are based on the errors that we receive from the destination email server. The first few deferrals are 15 minutes or less. The interval for subsequent retries increases to a maximum of 60 minutes. The interval duration expansion is dynamic, and considers multiple variables (queue size, internal message priority, etc.).

      - question: |
          After communication to the email server is restored, how are queued messages distributed?
        answer: |
          Queued messages are automatically processed in the order in which they were received, and are queued for delivery when the server became unavailable.
