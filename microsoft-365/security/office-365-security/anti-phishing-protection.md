# Anti-phishing protection in Microsoft 365

*Phishing* is an email attack that tries to steal sensitive information in messages that appear to be from legitimate or trusted senders. There are specific categories of phishing. For example:

- **Spear phishing** uses focused, customized content that's specifically tailored to the targeted recipients (typically, after reconnaissance on the recipients by the attacker).

- **Whaling** is directed at executives or other high value targets within an organization for maximum effect.

- **Business email compromise (BEC)** uses forged trusted senders (financial officers, customers, trusted partners, etc.) to trick recipients into approving payments, transferring funds, or revealing customer data.

- **Ransomware** that encrypts your data and demands payment to decrypt it almost always starts out in phishing messages. Anti-phishing protection can't help you decrypt encrypted files, but it can help detect the initial phishing messages that are associated with the ransomware campaign. For more information about recovering from a ransomware attack, see [Recover from a ransomware attack in Microsoft 365](recover-from-ransomware.md).

With the growing complexity of attacks, it's even difficult for trained users to identify sophisticated phishing messages. Fortunately, Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and the additional features in Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (Office 365 ATP) can help.

## Anti-phishing protection in EOP

EOP (that is, Microsoft 365 organizations without ATP) contains features that can help protect your organization from phishing threats:

- **Spoof intelligence**: Review spoofed messages from senders in internal and external domains, and allow or block those senders. For more information, see [Configure spoof intelligence in EOP](learn-about-spoof-intelligence.md).

- **Anti-phishing policies in EOP**: Turn spoof intelligence on or off, turn unauthenticated sender identification in Outlook on or off, and specify the action for blocked spoofed senders (move to Junk Email folder or quarantine). For more information, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in EOP](configure-anti-phishing-policies-eop.md).

- **Implicit email authentication**: EOP enhances standard email authentication checks for inbound email ([SPF](set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing.md), [DKIM](use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email.md), and [DMARC](use-dmarc-to-validate-email.md)) with sender reputation, sender history, recipient history, behavioral analysis, and other advanced techniques to help identify forged senders. For more information, see [Email authentication in Microsoft 365](email-validation-and-authentication.md).

## Additional anti-phishing protection in Office 365 ATP

Office 365 ATP contains additional and more advanced anti-phishing features:

- **ATP anti-phishing policies**: Create new custom policies, configure anti-impersonation settings (protect users and domains from impersonation), mailbox intelligence settings, and adjustable advanced phishing thresholds. For more information, see [Configure ATP anti-phishing policies in Microsoft 365](configure-atp-anti-phishing-policies.md). For more information about the differences between anti-phishing policies and ATP anti-phishing policies, see [Anti-phishing policies in Microsoft 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md).

- **Campaign Views**: Machine learning and other heuristics identify and analyze messages that are involved in coordinated phishing attacks against the entire service and your organization. For more information, see [Campaign Views in Office 365 ATP](campaigns.md).

- **Attack simulator**: Admins can create fake phishing messages and send them to internal users as an education tool. For more information, see [Attack Simulator in Office 365 ATP](attack-simulator.md).
