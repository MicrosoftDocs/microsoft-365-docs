## Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policies

With Microsoft Defender for Office 365, your organization's security team can configure protection by defining policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (go to <https://security.microsoft.com> \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies**).

Learn more by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vivvTmWJ_3c).

> [!TIP]
> For a quick list of policies to define, see [Protect against threats](protect-against-threats.md).

## Defender for Office 365 Policies

The policies that are defined for your organization determine the behavior and protection level for predefined threats. Policy options are extremely flexible. For example, your organization's security team can set fine-grained threat protection at the user, organization, recipient, and domain level. It is important to review your policies regularly because new threats and challenges emerge daily.

- **[Safe Attachments](safe-attachments.md)**: Provides zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system, by checking email attachments for malicious content. It routes all messages and attachments that do not have a virus/malware signature to a special environment, and then uses machine learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. If no suspicious activity is found, the message is forwarded to the mailbox. To learn more, see [Set up Safe Attachments policies](set-up-safe-attachments-policies.md).

- **[Safe Links](safe-links.md)**: Provides time-of-click verification of URLs, for example, in emails messages and Office files. Protection is ongoing and applies across your messaging and Office environment. Links are scanned for each click: safe links remain accessible and malicious links are dynamically blocked. To learn more, see [Set up Safe Links policies](set-up-safe-links-policies.md).

- **[Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md)**: Protects your organization when users collaborate and share files, by identifying and blocking malicious files in team sites and document libraries. To learn more, see [Turn on Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](turn-on-mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md).

- **[Anti-phishing protection in Defender for Office 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#exclusive-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)**: Detects attempts to impersonate your users and internal or custom domains. It applies machine learning models and advanced impersonation-detection algorithms to avert phishing attacks. To learn more, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.md).

## View Microsoft Defender for Office 365 reports

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes [reports](view-reports-for-mdo.md) to monitor Defender for Office 365. You can access the reports in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports** or directly at <https://security.microsoft.com/securityreports>.

Reports update in real-time, providing you with the latest insights. These reports also provide recommendations and alert you to imminent threats. Predefined reports include the following:

- [Threat Explorer (or real-time detections)](threat-explorer.md)
- [Threat protection status report](view-reports-for-mdo.md#threat-protection-status-report)
- ... and several more.

## Use threat investigation and response capabilities

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 includes best-of-class [threat investigation and response tools](office-365-ti.md) that enable your organization's security team to anticipate, understand, and prevent malicious attacks.

- **[Threat trackers](threat-trackers.md)** provide the latest intelligence on prevailing cybersecurity issues. For example, you can view information about the latest malware, and take countermeasures before it becomes an actual threat to your organization. Available trackers include [Noteworthy trackers](threat-trackers.md#noteworthy-trackers), [Trending trackers](threat-trackers.md#trending-trackers), [Tracked queries](threat-trackers.md#tracked-queries), and [Saved queries](threat-trackers.md#saved-queries).

- **[Threat Explorer (or real-time detections)](threat-explorer.md)** (also referred to as Explorer) is a real-time report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats. You can configure Explorer to show data for custom periods.

- **[Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training.md)** allows you to run realistic attack scenarios in your organization to identify vulnerabilities. Simulations of current types of attacks are available, including spear phishing credential harvest and attachment attacks, and password spray and brute force password attacks.

## Save time with automated investigation and response

(**NEW!**) When you are investigating a potential cyberattack, time is of the essence. The sooner you can identify and mitigate threats, the better off your organization will be. [Automated investigation and response](office-365-air.md) (AIR) capabilities include a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically, such as when an alert is triggered, or manually, such as from a view in Explorer. AIR can save your security operations team time and effort in mitigating threats effectively and efficiently. To learn more, see [AIR in Office 365](office-365-air.md).
