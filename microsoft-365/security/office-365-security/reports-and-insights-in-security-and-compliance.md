## Smart reports and insights overview

Monitoring capabilities available in the Security & Compliance Center include smart reports and insights that enable your security and compliance administrators to focus on high-priority issues, such as security attacks or increased suspicious activity.

In addition to highlighting problem areas, smart reports and insights include recommendations and links to view and explore data and also take quick actions.
