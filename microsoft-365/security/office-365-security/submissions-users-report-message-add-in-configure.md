# Enable the Microsoft Report Message or the Report Phishing add-ins

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin in a Microsoft 365 organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the **Submissions** page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md).

The Microsoft Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins for Outlook and Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA) makes it easy to report false positives (good email marked as bad) or false negatives (bad email allowed) to Microsoft and its affiliates for analysis.

Microsoft uses these user reported messages to improve the effectiveness of email protection technologies. For example, suppose that people are reporting many messages using the Report Phishing add-in. This information surfaces in the Security Dashboard and other reports. Your organization's security team can use this information as an indication that anti-phishing policies might need to be updated.

You can install either the Report Message or the Report Phishing add-in. If you want your users to report both spam and phishing messages, deploy the Report Message add-in in your organization.

The Report Message add-in provides the option to report both spam and phishing messages. Admins can enable the Report Message add-in for the organization, and individual users can install it for themselves.

The Report Phishing add-in provides the option to report only phishing messages. Admins can enable the Report Phishing add-in for the organization, and individual users can install it for themselves.

If you're an individual user, you can enable both the add-ins for yourself.

If you're a global administrator or an Exchange Online administrator, and Exchange is configured to use OAuth authentication, you can enable the Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins for your organization. Both add-ins are now available through [Centralized Deployment](../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).

After the add-in is installed and enabled, users will see the following icons:

- **Outlook for Windows**:

  - The **Report Message** icon in the Classic Ribbon:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="../../media/OutlookReportMessageIcon.png" alt-text="The Report Message add-in using the Classic Ribbon in Outlook." lightbox="../../media/OutlookReportMessageIcon.png":::

  - The **Report Message** icon in the Simplified Ribbon: Click ![More commands icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png) **More commands** \> **Protection** section \> **Report Message**.

    > :::image type="content" source="../../media/OWA-ReportPhishing.png" alt-text="The Report Phishing add-in icon in Outlook on the web." lightbox="../../media/OWA-ReportPhishing.png":::

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- The Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins work with most Microsoft 365 subscriptions and the following products:
  - Outlook on the web
  - Outlook 2013 SP1 or later
  - Outlook 2016 for Mac
  - Outlook included with Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise
  - Outlook for iOS and Android

- The add-ins are not available for shared, group, or delegated mailboxes (**Report message** will be greyed out).

- The add-ins are not available for on-premises Exchange mailboxes.

- Your existing web browser should work with the Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins. But, if you notice an add-in isn't available or not working as expected, try a different browser.

- For organizational installs, the organization needs to be configured to use OAuth authentication. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).

- Admins need to be a member of the Global admins role group. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md).

- For more information on how to report a message using the Report Message feature, see [Report false positives and false negatives in Outlook](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md).

- Organizations that have a URL filtering or security solution (such as a proxy and/or firewall) in place, must have ipagave.azurewebsites.net and outlook.office.com endpoints allowed to be reached on HTTPS protocol.

- Currently, reporting messages in shared mailboxes or other mailboxes by a delegate using the add-ins is not supported. Messages are not sent to the [reporting mailbox](submissions-user-reported-messages-files-custom-mailbox.md) or to Microsoft. Built-in reporting in Outlook on the web sends messages reported by a delegate to the reporting mailbox and/or to Microsoft.

For more information, see [Report false positives and false negatives in Outlook](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md).
