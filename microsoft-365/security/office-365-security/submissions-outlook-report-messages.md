# Report phishing and suspicious emails in Outlook for admins

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, users can report phishing and suspicious email in Outlook. Users can report false positives (good email that was blocked or sent to their Junk Email folder) and false negatives (unwanted email or phishing that was delivered to their Inbox) from Outlook on all platforms using free tools from Microsoft.

Microsoft provides the following tools for users to report good and bad messages:

- Built-in reporting in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA).
- The Microsoft Report Message or Report Phishing add-ins. The add-ins work on virtually all Outlook platforms, including Outlook on the web. For more information, see [Enable the Microsoft Report Message or Report Phishing add-ins](submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure.md).

For more information about reporting messages to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](submissions-report-messages-files-to-microsoft.md).

Admins configure user reported messages to go to a specified reporting mailbox, to Microsoft, or both. These user reported messages are available on the **User reported** tab on the **Submissions** page in the Microsoft Defender portal. For more information, see [User reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md).

## Use the built-in Report button in Outlook on the web

- The built-in **Report** button is available in Outlook on the web *only* if user reporting is turned on *and* the built-in **Report** button in Outlook (not a non-Microsoft add-in button) are configured in the [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) at <https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission>:

  If user reporting is turned off and a non-Microsoft add-in button is selected, the **Report** button isn't available in Outlook on the web.

- Currently, the **Report** button in Outlook on the web doesn't honor the before and after notification pop-up options in the user reported settings.

- Built-in reporting in Outlook on the web supports reporting messages from shared mailboxes or other mailboxes by a delegate.
  - Shared mailboxes require Send As or Send On Behalf permission for the user.
  - Other mailboxes require Send As or Send On Behalf permission _and_ Read and Manage permissions for the delegate.

### Use the built-in Report button in Outlook on the web to report junk and phishing messages

- Users can report a message as junk from the Inbox or any email folder other than Junk Email folder.
- Users can report a message as phishing from any email folder.

In Outlook on the web, select one or more messages, select **Report**, and then select **Report phishing** or **Report junk** in the dropdown list.

## Review reported messages

To review messages that users have reported to Microsoft, admins can use the **User reported** tab on the **Submissions** page in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>. For more information, see [View user reported messages to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md#view-user-reported-messages-to-microsoft).

> [!NOTE]
> If the [User reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) in the organization send user reported messages (email and [Microsoft Teams](submissions-teams.md)) to Microsoft (exclusively or in addition to the reporting mailbox), we do the same checks as when admins submit messages to Microsoft for analysis from the **Submissions** page. So, submitting or resubmitting messages to Microsoft is useful to admins only for messages that have never been submitted to Microsoft, or when you disagree with the original verdict.
