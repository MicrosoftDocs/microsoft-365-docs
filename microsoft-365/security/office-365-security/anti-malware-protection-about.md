# Anti-malware protection in EOP

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, email messages are automatically protected against malware by EOP. Some of the major categories of malware are:

- **Viruses** that infect other programs and data, and spread through your computer or network looking for programs to infect.
- **Spyware** that gathers your personal information, such as sign-in information and personal data, and sends it back to its author.
- **Ransomware** that encrypts your data and demands payment to decrypt it. Anti-malware software doesn't help you decrypt encrypted files, but it can detect the malware payload that's associated with the ransomware.

EOP offers multi-layered malware protection that's designed to catch all known malware in Windows, Linux, and Mac that travels into or out of your organization. The following options help provide anti-malware protection:

- **Layered defenses against malware**: Multiple anti-malware scan engines help protect against both known and unknown threats. These engines include powerful heuristic detection to provide protection even during the early stages of a malware outbreak. This multi-engine approach has been shown to provide significantly more protection than using just one anti-malware engine.
- **Real-time threat response**: During some outbreaks, the anti-malware team might have enough information about a virus or other form of malware to write sophisticated policy rules that detect the threat, even before a definition is available from any of the scan engines used by the service. These rules are published to the global network every 2 hours to provide your organization with an extra layer of protection against attacks.
- **Fast anti-malware definition deployment**: The anti-malware team maintains close relationships with partners who develop anti-malware engines. As a result, the service can receive and integrate malware definitions and patches before they're publicly released. Our connection with these partners often allows us to develop our own remedies as well. The service checks for updated definitions for all anti-malware engines every hour.

In EOP, messages that are found to contain malware in _any_ attachments are quarantined. Whether the recipients can view or otherwise interact with the quarantined messages is controlled by _quarantine policies_. By default, messages that were quarantined due to malware can only be viewed and released by admins. For more information, see the following articles:

- [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy)
- [EOP anti-malware policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#eop-anti-malware-policy-settings)
- [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md).

As explained in the next section, anti-malware policies also contain a _common attachments filter_. Messages that contain the specified file types are _automatically_ identified as malware. You can choose whether to quarantine or reject the messages.

For more information about anti-malware protection, see the [Anti-malware protection FAQ](anti-malware-protection-faq.yml).

To configure anti-malware policies, see [Configure anti-malware policies](anti-malware-policies-configure.md).

To submit malware to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](submissions-report-messages-files-to-microsoft.md).

## Anti-malware policies

Anti-malware policies control the settings and notification options for malware detections. The important settings in anti-malware policies are described in the following subsections.

### Recipient filters in anti-malware policies

In custom anti-malware policies, you can specify recipient conditions and exceptions that determine who the policy applies to. You can use the following properties for conditions and exceptions:

- **Users**
- **Groups**
- **Domains**

You can only use a condition or exception once, but the condition or exception can contain multiple values. Multiple values of the same condition or exception use OR logic (for example, _\<recipient1\>_ or _\<recipient2\>_). Different conditions or exceptions use AND logic (for example, _\<recipient1\>_ and _\<member of group 1\>_).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multiple different types of conditions or exceptions are not additive; they're inclusive. The policy is applied _only_ to those recipients that match _all_ of the specified recipient filters. For example, you configure a recipient filter condition in the policy with the following values:
>
> - Users: romain@contoso.com
> - Groups: Executives
>
> The policy is applied to romain@contoso.com _only_ if he's also a member of the Executives group. If he's not a member of the group, then the policy is not applied to him.
>
> Likewise, if you use the same recipient filter as an exception to the policy, the policy is not applied to romain@contoso.com _only_ if he's also a member of the Executives group. If he's not a member of the group, then the policy still applies to him.

### Common attachments filter in anti-malware policies

There are certain types of files that you really shouldn't send via email (for example, executable files). Why bother scanning these types of files for malware, when you should probably block them all, anyway? That's where the common attachments filter comes in. The file types that you specify are automatically treated as malware.

- The default file types: `ace, apk, app, appx, ani, arj, bat, cab, cmd,com, deb, dex, dll, docm, elf, exe, hta, img, iso, jar, jnlp, kext, lha, lib, library, lnk, lzh, macho, msc, msi, msix, msp, mst, pif, ppa, ppam, reg, rev, scf, scr, sct, sys, uif, vb, vbe, vbs, vxd, wsc, wsf, wsh, xll, xz, z`.

- Additional predefined file types that you can select from in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal<sup>\*</sup>: `7z, 7zip, a, accdb, accde, action, ade, adp, appxbundle, asf, asp, aspx, avi, bin, bundle, bz, bz2, bzip2, cab, caction, cer, chm, command, cpl, crt, csh, css, der, dgz, dmg, doc, docx, dot, dotm, dotx, dylib, font, gz, gzip, hlp, htm, html, imp, inf, ins, ipa, isp, its, jnlp, js, jse, ksh, lqy, mad, maf, mag, mam, maq, mar, mas, mat, mav, maw, mda, mdb, mde, mdt, mdw, mdz, mht, mhtml, mscompress, msh, msh1, msh1xml, msh2, msh2xml, mshxml, msixbundle, o, obj, odp, ods, odt, one, onenote, ops, package, pages, pbix, pdb, pdf, php, pkg, plugin, pps, ppsm, ppsx, ppt, pptm, pptx, prf, prg, ps1, ps1xml, ps2, ps2xml, psc1, psc2, pst, pub, py, rar, rpm, rtf, scpt, service, sh, shb, shtm, shx, so, tar, tarz, terminal, tgz, tool, url, vhd, vsd, vsdm, vsdx, vsmacros, vss, vssx, vst, vstm, vstx, vsw, workflow, ws, xhtml, xla, xlam, xls, xlsb, xlsm, xlsx, xlt, xltm, xltx, zi, zip, zipx`.

<sup>\*</sup> You can enter any text value in the Defender portal or using the _FileTypes_ parameter in the [New-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-malwarefilterpolicy) or [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-malwarefilterpolicy) cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell.

The common attachments filter uses best effort true-typing to detect the file type regardless of the filename extension. If true-typing fails or isn't supported for the specified file type, then simple extension matching is used.

When files are detected by the common attachments filter, you can choose to **Reject the message with a non-delivery report (NDR)** or **Quarantine the message**.

### Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in anti-malware policies

ZAP for malware quarantines messages that are found to contain malware _after_ they've been delivered to Exchange Online mailboxes. By default, ZAP for malware is turned on, and we recommend that you leave it on. For more information, see [Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) for malware](zero-hour-auto-purge.md#zero-hour-auto-purge-zap-for-malware).

### Quarantine policies in anti-malware policies

Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. By default, recipients don't receive notifications for messages that were quarantined as malware. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

### Admin notifications in anti-malware policies

You can specify an additional recipient (an admin) to receive notifications for malware detected in messages from internal or external senders. You can customize the **From address**, **subject**, and **message text** for internal and external notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Admin notifications are sent only for _attachments_ that are classified as malware.
>
> The quarantine policy that's assigned to the anti-malware policy determines whether recipients receive email notifications for messages that were quarantined as malware.

### Priority of anti-malware policies

If you create multiple custom anti-malware policies, you can specify the order that they're applied. No two policies can have the same priority, and policy processing stops after the first policy is applied (the highest priority policy for that recipient).

For more information about the order of precedence and how multiple policies are evaluated, see [Order and precedence of email protection](how-policies-and-protections-are-combined.md) and [Order of precedence for preset security policies and other policies](preset-security-policies.md#order-of-precedence-for-preset-security-policies-and-other-policies).

## Default anti-malware policy

Every organization has a built-in anti-malware policy named Default that has the following properties:

- The policy is the default policy (the **IsDefault** property has the value `True`), and you can't delete the default policy.
- The policy is automatically applied to all recipients in the organization, and you can't turn it off.
- The policy is always applied last (the **Priority** value is **Lowest** and you can't change it. Any custom anti-malware policies that you create are always applied before the default policy (custom anti-malware policies always have a higher priority than the default policy).
