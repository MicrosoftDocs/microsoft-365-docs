# Protect against threats in Office 365

Office 365 includes a variety of threat protection features. Here's a quick-start guide you can use as a checklist to make sure your threat protection features are set up for your organization. If you're new to threat protection features in Office 365, or you're just not sure where to begin, use the following guidance as a starting point. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Initial recommended settings are included for each kind of policy; however, many options are available, and you can adjust your settings to meet your specific organization's needs**. Allow approximately 30 minutes for your policies or changes to work their way through your datacenter.

Time-of-click protection from malicious URLs and files is available in subscriptions that include [Office 365 ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description) (ATP), and is set up through [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md) and [ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md) policies.

### ATP Safe Attachments policies

To set up [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), you must define at least one ATP Safe Attachments policy.

(This prevents people from opening, moving, copying, or sharing files that are detected as malicious.)  

To learn more, see [Set up Office 365 ATP Safe Attachments policies](set-up-atp-safe-attachments-policies.md) and [Turn on Office 365 ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](turn-on-atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md).

Advanced anti-phishing protection is available in [ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description). The following procedure describes how to configure an ATP anti-phishing policy. The steps are similar for configuring an anti-phishing policy (without ATP).

    - On the **Add domains to protect** tab, turn on **Automatically include the domains I own**. If you have custom domains, add those as well.

    - On the **Actions** tab, select **Move message to the recipients' Junk Email folders** for both impersonated user and impersonated domain, and turn on safety tips.

    - On the **Mailbox intelligence** tab, make sure mailbox intelligence is turned on.

    - On the **Review your settings** tab, after you have reviewed your settings, click **Save**.

4. In the **Spoof** section, click **Edit**, and then specify the following settings:

    - On the **Spoofing filter settings** tab, make sure anti-spoofing protection is turned on.

    - On the **Actions** tab, choose Move message to the recipients' Junk Email folders.

    - On the **Review your settings** tab, after you have reviewed your settings, click **Save**. (If you didn't make any changes, click **Cancel**.)

5. Close the default policy settings page.

To learn more about your anti-phishing policy options, see [Set up anti-phishing policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md).

## Part 4 - Anti-spam protection

[Anti-spam protection](anti-spam-protection.md) is available in subscriptions that include [EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description).

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** > **Policy** > **Anti-spam**.

2. On the **Custom** tab, turn **Custom settings** on.

3. Expand **Default spam filter policy**, click **Edit policy**, and then specify the following settings:

    - In the **Spam and bulk actions** section, set the threshold to a value of 5 or 6.

4. Click **Save**.

To learn more about your anti-spam policy options, see [Configure the anti-spam policies](configure-the-anti-spam-policies.md).

## Part 5 - Additional settings to configure

In addition to configuring protection from malware, malicious URLs and files, phishing, and spam, we recommend that you configure your zero-hour auto purge and audit logging settings.

### Zero-hour auto purge for email

[Zero-hour auto purge](zero-hour-auto-purge.md) (ZAP) is available in subscriptions that include [EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description). This protection is turned on by default; however, the following conditions must be met for protection to be in effect:

- Spam actions are set to **Move message to Junk Email folder** in [anti-spam policies](anti-spam-protection.md).

- Users have kept their default [junk email settings](ensure-that-spam-is-routed-to-each-user-s-junk-email-folder.md), and have not turned off junk email protection.

To learn more, see [Zero-hour auto purge - protection against spam and malware](zero-hour-auto-purge.md).

### Audit logging for reporting and investigation

Audit logging is available in subscriptions that include [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description). In order to view data in threat protection reports, such as the [Security Dashboard](security-dashboard.md), [email security reports](../../compliance/view-email-security-reports.md), and [Explorer](threat-explorer.md), audit logging must be turned on for your organization. To learn more, see [Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off](../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md).

## Post-setup tasks

After you have configured your threat protection features, make sure to monitor how those features are working, review and revise your policies as needed, and watch for new features and service updates.
