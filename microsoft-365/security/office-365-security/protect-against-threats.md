# Protect against threats

Here's a quick-start guide that breaks the configuration of Advanced Threat Protection into chunks. If you're new to threat protection features in Office 365, not sure where to begin, or if you learn best by *doing*, use this guidance as a checklist and a starting point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Initial recommended settings are included for each kind of policy; however, many options are available, and you can adjust your settings to meet your specific organization's needs**. Allow approximately 30 minutes for your policies or changes to work their way through your datacenter.

## Requirements

### Subscriptions

Threat protection features are included in *all* Microsoft or Office 365 subscriptions; however, some subscriptions have advanced features. The table below lists the protection features included in this article together with the minimum subscription requirements.

> [!TIP]
> Notice that, beyond the directions to turn on auditing, *steps* start anti-malware, anti-phishing, and anti-spam, which are marked as part of Office 365 Exchange Online Protection (**EOP**). This can seem odd in an Advanced Threat Protection article, until you remember Advanced Threat Protection (**ATP**) contains, and builds on, EOP.

4. Click **Save**.

To learn more about your anti-spam policy options, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

## Part 4 - Protection from malicious URLs and files (Safe Links and Safe Attachments)

Time-of-click protection from malicious URLs and files is available in subscriptions that include [Office 365 ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description) (ATP). It's set up through [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md) and [ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md) policies.

### ATP Safe Attachments policies

To set up [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), you must define at least one ATP Safe Attachments policy.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** > **Policy** > **ATP safe attachments**.

2. Select the option **Turn on ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams**.

3. In the **Protect email attachments** section, click the plus sign (**+**).

4. Specify the following settings:

   - In the **Name** box, type `Block malware`.

   - In the response section, choose **Block**.

   - In the **Redirect attachment** section, select the option **Enable redirect**. Specify the email address for your organization's security administrator or operator, who will review detected files.

   - In the **Applied to** section, choose **The recipient domain is**. Then, select your domain, choose **Add**, and then **OK**.

5. **Save**.

6. (**Recommended additional step**) As a global administrator or a SharePoint Online administrator, run the **[Set-SPOTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant)** cmdlet with the **DisallowInfectedFileDownload** parameter set to  *true* for your Microsoft 365 environment. (This prevents people from opening, moving, copying, or sharing files that are detected as malicious.)

To learn more, see [Set up Office 365 ATP Safe Attachments policies](set-up-atp-safe-attachments-policies.md) and [Turn on Office 365 ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](turn-on-atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md).

### ATP Safe Links policies

To set up [ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md), review and edit your default policy, and add a policy for specific users.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** > **Policy** > **ATP Safe Links**.

2. Double-click the **Default** policy.

3. In the **Use safe links in** section, select the option **Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office for iOS and Android**, and then click **Save**.

4. In the **Policies that apply to specific recipients** section, click the plus sign (**+**).

5. Specify the following settings:

   - In the **Name** box, type a name, such as `Safe Links`.

   - In the **Select the action** section, choose **On**.

   - Select these options:

     - **Use safe attachments to scan downloadable content**

     - **Apply safe links to email messages sent within the organization**

     - **Do not let users click through safe links to original URL**

   - In the **Applied to** section, choose **The recipient domain is**. Then, select your domain, choose **Add**, and then **OK**.

6. **Save**.

To learn more, see [Set up Office 365 ATP Safe Links policies](set-up-atp-safe-links-policies.md).

## Part 5 - Turn on ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams workloads

Workloads like SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams are built for collaboration. Using ATP helps with blocking and detection of files that are identified as malicious in team sites and document libraries. You can read more about how that works [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams?view=o365-worldwide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you begin this procedure, make sure that audit logging is already turned on for your Microsoft 365 environment**. This is typically done by someone who has the Audit Logs role assigned in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Turn audit log search on or off](../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md)!

1. Go to <https://protection.office.com>, and sign in with your work or school account.

2. In the Security & Compliance Center, in the left navigation pane, under **Threat management**, choose **Policy** \> **Safe Attachments**.

   ![In the Security & Compliance Center, choose Threat management \> Policy](../../media/08849c91-f043-4cd1-a55e-d440c86442f2.png)

3. Select **Turn on ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams**.

   ![Turn on Advanced Threat Protection for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams](../../media/48cfaace-59cc-4e60-bf86-05ff6b99bdbf.png)

4. **Save**.

5. Review (and, as appropriate, edit) your organization's [Safe Attachments policies](set-up-atp-safe-attachments-policies.md) and [Safe Links policies](set-up-atp-safe-links-policies.md).

6. (Recommended) As a global administrator or a SharePoint Online administrator, run the **[Set-SPOTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant)** cmdlet with the _DisallowInfectedFileDownload_ parameter set to `$true`.

   - `$true` blocks all actions (except Delete) for detected files. People cannot open, move, copy, or share detected files.
   - `$false` blocks all actions except Delete and Download. People can choose to accept the risk and download a detected file.

   > [!TIP]
   > To learn more about using PowerShell with Microsoft 365, see [Manage Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/manage-microsoft-365-with-microsoft-365-powershell).

7. Allow up to 30 minutes for your changes to spread to all Microsoft 365 datacenters.

### Now set up alerts for detected files

To receive notification when a file in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or Microsoft Teams has been identified as malicious, you can set up an alert.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Alerts** \> **Manage alerts**.

2. Choose **New alert policy**.

3. Specify a name for the alert. For example, you could type Malicious Files in Libraries.

4. Type a description for the alert. For example, you could type Notifies admins when malicious files are detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, or Microsoft Teams.

5. In the **Send this alert when...** section, set:

   a. In the **Activities** list, choose **Detected malware in file**.

   b. Leave the **Users** field empty.

6. In the **Send this alert to...** section, select one or more global administrators, security administrators, or security readers who should receive notification when a malicious file is detected.

7. **Save**.

To learn more about alerts, see [Create activity alerts in the Security & Compliance Center](../../compliance/create-activity-alerts.md).

## Part 6 - Additional settings to configure

Along with configuring protection from malware, malicious URLs and files, phishing, and spam, we recommend you configure zero-hour auto purge.

### Zero-hour auto purge for email in EOP

[Zero-hour auto purge](zero-hour-auto-purge.md) (ZAP) is available in subscriptions that include [EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-service-description). This protection is turned on by default; however, the following conditions must be met for protection to be in effect:

- Spam actions are set to **Move message to Junk Email folder** in [anti-spam policies](anti-spam-protection.md).

- Users have kept their default [junk email settings](ensure-that-spam-is-routed-to-each-user-s-junk-email-folder.md), and haven't turned off junk email protection.

To learn more, see [Zero-hour auto purge - protection against spam and malware](zero-hour-auto-purge.md).

## Post-setup tasks and next steps

After configuring the threat protection features, make sure to monitor how those features are working! Review and revise your policies so that they do what you need them to. Also, watch for new features and service updates that can add value.
