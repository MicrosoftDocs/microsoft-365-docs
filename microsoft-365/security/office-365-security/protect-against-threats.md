# Protect against threats

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md)

Here's a quick-start guide that breaks the configuration of Defender for Office 365 into chunks. If you're new to threat protection features in Office 365, not sure where to begin, or if you learn best by *doing*, use this guidance as a checklist and a starting point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Initial recommended settings are included for each kind of policy; however, many options are available, and you can adjust your settings to meet your specific organization's needs**. Allow approximately 30 minutes for your policies or changes to work their way through your datacenter.

## Requirements

### Subscriptions

Threat protection features are included in *all* Microsoft or Office 365 subscriptions; however, some subscriptions have advanced features. The table below lists the protection features included in this article together with the minimum subscription requirements.

> [!TIP]
> Notice that, beyond the directions to turn on auditing, *steps* start anti-malware, anti-phishing, and anti-spam, which are marked as part of Office 365 Exchange Online Protection (**EOP**). This can seem odd in an Defender for Office 365 article, until you remember (**Defender for Office 365**) contains, and builds on, EOP.

### Roles and permissions

To configure Defender for Office 365 policies, you must be assigned an appropriate role in the [Security & Compliance Center](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-securitycompliance-center). Take a look at the table below for roles that can do these actions.

****

|Role or role group|Where to learn more|
|---|---|
|global administrator|[About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md)|
|Security Administrator|[Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles)|
|Exchange Online Organization Management|[Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo) <p> and <p> [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell)|
|

To learn more, see [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

## Part 4 - Protection from malicious URLs and files (Safe Links and Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365)

Time-of-click protection from malicious URLs and files is available in subscriptions that include [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description). It's set up through [Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md) and [Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md) policies.

### Safe Attachments policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

To set up [Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), create at least one Safe Links policy.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** \> **Policy** \> **ATP Safe Attachments**, and then click **Create**.

2. In the **New Safe Attachments policy** wizard that appears, configure the following settings:

   - In the **Name** box, type `Block malware`, and then click **Next**.

   - On the **Settings** page, configure the following settings:
     - In the **Safe attachments unknown malware response** section, choose **Block**.
     - In the **Redirect attachment** section, select the option **Enable redirect**. Specify the email address for your organization's security administrator or operator, who will review detected files.

     Click **Next**.

3. On the **Applied to** page, click **Add a condition**, choose **Applied if: The recipient domain is**, click **Add**, select your domain or domains, click **Add**, click **Done**, and then click **Next**.

4. Review your settings and then click **Finish**.

### Safe Links policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

To set up [Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md), review and edit your global settings for Safe Links, and create at least one Safe Links policy.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** \> **Policy** \> **ATP Safe Links**, and click **Global settings**, and then configure the following settings:

   - Verify **Use Safe Links in: Office 365 applications** is turned on: ![Toggle on](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png).
   - **Do not track when users click Safe Links**: Turn this setting off to track user clicks: ![Toggle off](../../media/scc-toggle-off.png).
   - **Do not let users click through safe links to original URL**: Verify this setting is turned on: ![Toggle on](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png).

   When you're finished, click **Save**.

2. Back on the main Safe Links page, click **Create**.

3. In the **Create Safe Links policy** wizard that appears, configure the following settings:

   - In the **Name** box, type a name, such as `Safe Links`, and then click **Next**.

5. Review your settings and then click **Finish**.

To learn more, see [Set up Safe Links policies](set-up-atp-safe-links-policies.md).

## Part 5 - Verify Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams is turned on

Workloads like SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams are built for collaboration. Using Defender for Office 365 helps with blocking and detection of files that are identified as malicious in team sites and document libraries. You can read more about how that works [here](atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you begin this procedure, make sure that audit logging is already turned on for your Microsoft 365 environment**. This is typically done by someone who has the Audit Logs role assigned in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Turn audit log search on or off](../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md)!

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Threat management** \> **Policy** \> **ATP Safe Attachments**, and then click **Global settings**.

2. Verify the **Turn on Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams** toggle is to the right: ![Toggle on](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png), and then click **Save**.

3. Review (and, as appropriate, edit) your organization's [Safe Attachments policies](set-up-atp-safe-attachments-policies.md) and [Safe Links policies](set-up-atp-safe-links-policies.md).

4. (Recommended) As a global administrator or a SharePoint Online administrator, run the **[Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant)** cmdlet with the _DisallowInfectedFileDownload_ parameter set to `$true`.

   - `$true` blocks all actions (except Delete) for detected files. People cannot open, move, copy, or share detected files.
   - `$false` blocks all actions except Delete and Download. People can choose to accept the risk and download a detected file.

   > [!TIP]
   > To learn more about using PowerShell with Microsoft 365, see [Manage Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](../../enterprise/manage-microsoft-365-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).

5. Allow up to 30 minutes for your changes to spread to all Microsoft 365 datacenters.

### Now set up alerts for detected files

To receive notification when a file in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or Microsoft Teams has been identified as malicious, you can set up an alert.

1. In the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), choose **Alerts** \> **Manage alerts**.

2. Choose **New alert policy**.

3. Specify a name for the alert. For example, you could type Malicious Files in Libraries.

4. Type a description for the alert. For example, you could type Notifies admins when malicious files are detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, or Microsoft Teams.

5. In the **Send this alert when...** section, set:

   a. In the **Activities** list, choose **Detected malware in file**.

   b. Leave the **Users** field empty.

6. In the **Send this alert to...** section, select one or more global administrators, security administrators, or security readers who should receive notification when a malicious file is detected.

7. **Save**.

To learn more about alerts, see [Create activity alerts in the Security & Compliance Center](../../compliance/create-activity-alerts.md).

## Part 6 - Additional settings to configure

Along with configuring protection from malware, malicious URLs and files, phishing, and spam, we recommend you configure zero-hour auto purge.

### Zero-hour auto purge for email in EOP

[Zero-hour auto purge](zero-hour-auto-purge.md) (ZAP) is available in subscriptions that include [EOP](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-service-description). This protection is turned on by default; however, the following conditions must be met for protection to be in effect:

- Spam actions are set to **Move message to Junk Email folder** in [anti-spam policies](anti-spam-protection.md).

- Users have kept their default [junk email settings](ensure-that-spam-is-routed-to-each-user-s-junk-email-folder.md), and haven't turned off junk email protection.

To learn more, see [Zero-hour auto purge - protection against spam and malware](zero-hour-auto-purge.md).

## Post-setup tasks and next steps

After configuring the threat protection features, make sure to monitor how those features are working! Review and revise your policies so that they do what you need them to. Also, watch for new features and service updates that can add value.
