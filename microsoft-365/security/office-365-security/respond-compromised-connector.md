# Respond to a compromised connector

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**

- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

Connectors are used for enabling mail flow between Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and email servers that you have in your on-premises environment. For more information, see [Configure mail flow using connectors in Exchange Online](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow).

A compromised inbound connector is defined as when an unauthorized individual either applies change(s) to an existing inbound connector or creates a new inbound connector in a Microsoft 365 tenant, with the intention of sending spam or phish emails. Note that this is applicable only to inbound connectors of type OnPremises. 

## Detect a compromised connector

Here are some of the characteristics of a compromised connector:

- Sudden spike in outbound mail volume. 

- Mismatch between P1 and P2 senders in outbound mails. For more information on P1 and P2 senders, see [How EOP validates the From address to prevent phishing](how-office-365-validates-the-from-address.md#an-overview-of-email-message-standards).

- Outbound mails sent from a domain that is not provisioned or registered. 

- The connector is blocked from sending relaying mail. 

- The presence of an inbound connector wasn't created by the intended user or the administrator. 

- Unauthorized change(s) in existing connector configuration, such as name, domain name, and IP address. 

- A recently compromised administrator account. Note that you can edit connector configuration only if you have administrative access. 

## Secure and restore email function to a suspected compromised connector

You must complete all the following steps to regain access to your connector. These steps help you remove any back-door entries that may have been added to your connector.

### Step 1: Identify if an inbound connector has been compromised 

#### Review recent suspicious connector traffic or related messages

If you have [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md), go directly to https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorer. 

1. Select **Connector**, insert **Connector Name**, select date range, and then click **Refresh**.

2. Identify if there's any abnormal spike or dip in email traffic.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/connector-compromise-abnormal-spike.png" alt-text="Number of emails delivered to junk folder" lightbox="../../media/connector-compromise-abnormal-spike.png":::

3. Identify: 

    - If **Sender IP** matches with your organization's on-prem IP address. 

    - If a significant number of emails were recently sent to the **Junk** folder. This is a good indicator of a compromised connector being used to send spam. 

    - If the recipients are the ones that your organization usually stays in contact with. 

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/connector-compromise-sender-ip.png" alt-text="Sender IP and your organization's on-prem IP address" lightbox="../../media/connector-compromise-sender-ip.png":::

If you have [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](defender-for-office-365.md) or [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md), go to https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/messagetrace. 

1. Open **Suspicious connector activity** alert in https://security.microsoft.com/alerts.  

2. Select an activity under **Activity list**, and copy suspicious **connector domain** and **IP address** detected in the alert.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/connector-compromise-outbound-email-details.png" alt-text="Connector compromise outbound email details" lightbox="../../media/connector-compromise-outbound-email-details.png":::
    
3. Search by using **connector domain** and **IP address** in [**Message trace**](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/messagetrace). 

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/connector-compromise-new-message-trace.png" alt-text="New message trace flyout" lightbox="../../media/connector-compromise-new-message-trace.png":::
    
4. In the **Message trace** search results, identify: 

    - If a significant number of emails were recently marked as **FilteredAsSpam**. This is a good indicator of a compromised connector being used to send spam. 

    - If the recipients are the ones that your organization usually stays in contact with.

#### Investigate and validate connector-related activity 

Use the following command line in PowerShell to investigate and validate connector-related activity by a user in the audit log. For more information, see [Use a PowerShell script to search the audit log](/compliance/audit-log-search-script). 

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate "<ExDateTime>" -EndDate "<ExDateTime>" -Operations "New-InboundConnector", "Set-InboundConnector", "Remove-InboundConnector
```

### Step 2: Review and revert unauthorized change(s) in a connector 

1. Sign into https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/. 

2. Review and revert unauthorized connector change(s). 

### Step 3: Unblock the connector to re-enable mail flow 

1. Sign into https://security.microsoft.com/restrictedentities. 

2. Select the restricted connector to unblock the connector. 

### Step 4: Investigate and remediate potentially compromised administrative user account

If a user with an unauthorized connector activity is identified, you can investigate this user for potential compromise. For more information, see [Responding to a Compromised Email Account](responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.md).
