# Anti-spam and anti-malware protection in EOP

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, email messages are automatically protected against spam and malware by EOP.

Spam is unsolicited and unwanted email. Malware is viruses and spyware. Viruses infect other programs and data, and they spread throughout your computer looking for programs to infect. Spyware is a specific type of malware that gathers your personal information (for example, sign-in information and personal data) and sends it back to the malware author.

EOP has built-in inbound and outbound malware filtering to help protect your organization from malicious software, and built-in spam filtering to help protect your organization from both receiving and sending spam (for example, in case of compromised accounts). Admins don't need to set up or maintain the filtering technologies because they're enabled by default. However, you can customize the settings based on the needs of your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use SharePoint Online, anti-malware protection is also automatically provided for files that are uploaded and saved to document libraries. This protection is provided by the Microsoft anti-malware engine that's also integrated into Exchange. This anti-malware service runs on all SharePoint Online Content Front Ends (CFEs).
