# Anti-spam and anti-malware protection in Office 365

If you're an Office 365 customer whose mailboxes are hosted in Microsoft Exchange Online, your email messages are automatically protected against spam and malware.
  
Spam is unsolicited (and typically unwanted) email messages. Malware is comprised of viruses and spyware. Viruses infect other programs and data, and they spread throughout your computer looking for programs to infect. Spyware refers to malware that gathers your personal information, such as sign-in information and personal data, and sends it back to the malware author. 
  
Office 365 has built-in malware and spam filtering capabilities that help protect inbound and outbound messages from malicious software and help protect you from spam. Admins don't need to set up or maintain the filtering technologies, which are enabled by default. However, they can make company-specific filtering customizations in the Exchange admin center (EAC).
  
> [!TIP]
> We recommend viewing the following series of introductory videos about how to get started with protecting your email messaging environment: [Videos for getting started with protecting your email](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=404179). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you use SharePoint Online as part of Office 365, anti-malware protection is also automatically provided for files that are uploaded and saved to document libraries. This protection is provided by the Microsoft anti-malware engine that's also integrated into Exchange. This anti-malware service runs on all SharePoint Online Content Front Ends (CFEs). 
  
## Manage your anti-spam settings in Exchange Online

The following table contains links to topics that explain how anti-spam protection works in Exchange Online and how you can fine-tune your anti-spam configuration settings to best meet the needs of your organization.

We're still rolling out [threat management](protect-against-threats.md), including anti-spam and anti-malware for the Security &amp; Compliance Center, so you might not see all of these there just yet. During the rollout, some features, for example Anti-malware, DKIM, and others, will continue to be available through the Exchange admin center (EAC) for a limited time.

In some cases, there are minor differences between the EAC and the Security &amp; Compliance Center implementations. For example, supported characters for spam filters are different between the two platforms. Articles are provided that give more information about specific differences when they occur.
