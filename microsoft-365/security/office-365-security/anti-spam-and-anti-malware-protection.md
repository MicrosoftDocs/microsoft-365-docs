# Anti-spam and anti-malware protection in Office 365

If you're an Office 365 customer with mailboxes in Exchange Online or a standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) customer without Exchange Online mailboxes, your email messages are automatically protected against spam and malware.

Spam is unsolicited (and typically unwanted) email. Malware is viruses and spyware. Viruses infect other programs and data, and they spread throughout your computer looking for programs to infect. Spyware is a specific type of malware that gathers your personal information (for example, sign-in information and personal data) and sends it back to the malware author.

Office 365 has built-in inbound and outbound malware filtering to help protect your organization from malicious software, and built-in spam filtering to help protect your organization from both receiving and sending spam (for example, in case of compromised accounts). Admins don't need to set up or maintain the filtering technologies because they're enabled by default. However, you can customize the filter settings based on the needs of your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use SharePoint Online as part of Office 365, anti-malware protection is also automatically provided for files that are uploaded and saved to document libraries. This protection is provided by the Microsoft anti-malware engine that's also integrated into Exchange. This anti-malware service runs on all SharePoint Online Content Front Ends (CFEs).
