# Configuration analyzer for protection policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

Configuration analyzer in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal provides a central location to find and fix security policies where the settings are below the Standard protection and Strict protection profile settings in [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md).

The following types of policies are analyzed by the configuration analyzer:

- **Exchange Online Protection (EOP) policies**: This includes Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes and standalone EOP organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes:
  - [Anti-spam policies](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).
  - [Anti-malware policies](anti-malware-policies-configure.md).
  - [EOP anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings).

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policies**: This includes organizations with Microsoft 365 E5 or Defender for Office 365 add-on subscriptions:
  - Anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365, which include:
    - The same [spoof settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) that are available in the EOP anti-phishing policies.
    - [Impersonation settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)
    - [Advanced phishing thresholds](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#advanced-phishing-thresholds-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)
  - [Safe Links policies](safe-links-policies-configure.md).
  - [Safe Attachments policies](safe-attachments-policies-configure.md).

The Standard and Strict policy setting values that are used as baselines are described in [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Configuration analyzer** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/configurationAnalyzer>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal before you can do the procedures in this article:
  - To use the configuration analyzer **and** make updates to security policies, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
  - For read-only access to the configuration analyzer, you need to be a member of the **Global Reader** or **Security Reader** role groups.

  For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role gives users the required permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  > - The **View-Only Organization Management** role group in [Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups) also gives read-only access to the feature.

## Use the configuration analyzer in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & Collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Configuration analyzer** in the **Templated policies** section. To go directly to the **Configuration analyzer** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/configurationAnalyzer>.

The **Configuration analyzer** page has three main tabs:

- **Standard recommendations**: Compare your existing security policies to the Standard recommendations. You can adjust your settings values to bring them up to the same level as Standard.
- **Strict recommendations**: Compare your existing security policies to the Strict recommendations. You can adjust your settings values to bring them up to the same level as Strict.
- **Configuration drift analysis and history**: Audit and track policy changes over time.

### Standard recommendations and Strict recommendations tabs in the configuration analyzer

By default, the configuration analyzer opens on the **Standard recommendations** tab. You can switch to the **Strict recommendations** tab. The settings, layout, and actions are the same on both tabs.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/configuration-analyzer-settings-and-recommendations-view.png" alt-text="The Settings and recommendations view in the Configuration analyzer" lightbox="../../media/configuration-analyzer-settings-and-recommendations-view.png":::

The first section of the tab displays the number of settings in each type of policy that need improvement as compared to Standard or Strict protection. The types of policies are:

- **Anti-spam**
- **Anti-phishing**
- **Anti-malware**
- **Safe Attachments** (if your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365)
- **Safe Links** (if your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365)

If a policy type and number isn't shown, then all of your policies of that type meet the recommended settings of Standard or Strict protection.

The rest of the tab is the table of settings that need to be brought up to the level Standard or Strict protection. The table contains the following columns:

- **Recommendations**: The value of the setting in the Standard or Strict protection profile.
- **Policy**: The name of the affected policy that contains the setting.
- **Policy group/setting name**: The name of the setting that requires your attention.
- **Policy type**: Anti-spam, Anti-phishing, Anti-malware, Safe Links, or Safe Attachments.
- **Current configuration**: The current value of the setting.
- **Last modified**: The date that the policy was last modified.
- **Status**: Typically, this value is **Not started**.

### Change a policy setting to the recommended value

On the **Standard protection** or **Strict protection** tab of the configuration analyzer, select the row in the table. The following buttons appear:

- **Apply recommendation**
- **View policy**
- **Refresh**:

If you select a row and click **Apply recommendation**, a confirmation dialog (with the option to not show the dialog again) appears. If you click **OK**, the following things happen:

- The setting is updated to the recommended value.
- The **Apply recommendation** and **View policy** disappear (only the **Refresh** button remains).
- The **Status** value for the row changes to **Complete**.

If you select a row and click **View policy** you're taken to the details flyout of the affected policy in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal where you can manually update the setting.

After you automatically or manually update the setting, click **Refresh** to see the reduced number of recommendations and the removal of the updated row from the results.

### Configuration drift analysis and history tab in the configuration analyzer

This tab allows you to track the changes that have been made to your security policies and how those changes compare to the Standard or Strict settings. By default, the following information is displayed:

- **Last modified**
- **Modified by**
- **Setting Name**
- **Policy**: The name of the affected policy.
- **Type**: Anti-spam, Anti-phishing, Anti-malware, Safe Links, or Safe Attachments.
- **Configuration change**: The old value and the new value of the setting
- **Configuration drift**: The value **Increase** or **Decrease** that indicates the setting increased or decreased security compared to the recommended Standard or Strict setting.

To filter the results, click **Filter**. In the **Filters** flyout that appears, you can select from the following filters:

- **Start time** and **End time** (date): You can go back as far as 90 days from today.
- **Standard protection** or **Strict protection**

When you're finished, click **Apply**.

To export the results to a .csv file, click **Export**.

To filter the results by a specific **Modified by**, **Setting name**, or **Type** value, use the **Search** box.
