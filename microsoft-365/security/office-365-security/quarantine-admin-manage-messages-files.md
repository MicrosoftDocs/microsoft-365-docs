# Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP](quarantine-about.md).

Admins can view, release, and delete all types of quarantined messages for all users. Admins can also report false positives to Microsoft.

By default, only admins can manage messages that were quarantined as malware, high confidence phishing, or as a result of mail flow rules (also known as transport rules). But admins can use _quarantine policies_ to define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined (for supported features). For more information, see [Quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md).

Admins in organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can also manage files that were quarantined by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md).

You view and manage quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

Watch this short video to learn how to manage quarantined messages as an administrator.
> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWGGPF]

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Microsoft 365 Defender role based access control (RBAC)](/microsoft-365/security/defender/manage-rbac): **Security Data / email quarantine (manage)** (management via PowerShell). Currently, this option requires membership in the Microsoft 365 Defender Preview program.
  - [Exchange Online RBAC](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo):
    - _Take action on quarantined messages for all users_: Membership in the **Organization Management**, **Security Administrator**, or **Quarantine Administrator** role groups.
    - _Submit messages from quarantine to Microsoft_:  Membership in the **Security Administrator** role group.
    - _Read-only access to quarantined messages for all users_: Membership in the **Global Reader**, **Security Reader**, or **View-Only Organization Management** role groups.
  - [Email & collaboration RBAC in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md): Membership in the **Quarantine Administrator** role group. To do quarantine procedures in Exchange Online PowerShell, you also need membership in the **Hygiene Management** role group in Exchange Online RBAC.
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, **Global Reader**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

- Quarantined messages are retained for a default period of time based on why they were quarantined. After the retention period expires, the messages are automatically deleted and are not recoverable. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP and Defender for Office 365](quarantine-about.md).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage quarantined email messages

### View quarantined email

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Review** \> **Quarantine**. To go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

2. On the **Quarantine** page, verify that the **Email** tab is selected.

3. You can sort the results by clicking on an available column header. Click **Customize columns**  to change the columns that are shown. The default values are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):

   - **Time received**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Subject**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Sender**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Quarantine reason**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Release status**<sup>\*</sup>

   - **Message ID**
   - **Policy name**
   - **Message size**
   - **Mail direction**
   - **Recipient tag**

   When you're finished, click **Apply**.

4. To filter the results, click **Filter**. The following filters are available in the **Filters** flyout that appears:
   - **Message ID**: The globally unique identifier of the message.

     For example, you used [message trace](message-trace-scc.md) to look for a message that was sent to a user in your organization, and you determine that the message was quarantined instead of delivered. Be sure to include the full message ID value, which might include angle brackets (\<\>). For example: `<79239079-d95a-483a-aacf-e954f592a0f6@XYZPR00BM0200.contoso.com>`.

   - **Sender address**
   - **Recipient address**
   - **Subject**
   - **Time received**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
   - **Expires**: Filter messages by when they will expire from quarantine:
     - **Today**
     - **Next 2 days**
     - **Next 7 days**
     - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
   - **Recipient tag**
   - **Quarantine reason**:
     - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)
     - **Bulk**
     - **Spam**
     - **Malware**: Anti-malware policies in EOP or Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365. The **Policy Type** value indicates which feature was used.
     - **Phishing**: The spam filter verdict was **Phishing** or anti-phishing protection quarantined the message ([spoof settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) or [impersonation protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)).
     - **High confidence phishing**
   - **Recipient**: **All users** or **Only me**. End users can only manage quarantined messages sent to them.
   - **Release status**: Any of the following values:
     - **Needs review**
     - **Approved**
     - **Denied**
     - **Release requested**
     - **Released**
   - **Policy Type**: Filter messages by policy type:
     - **Anti-malware policy**
     - **Safe Attachments policy**
     - **Anti-phishing policy**
     - **Anti-spam policy**
     - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)

   When you're finished, click **Apply**. To clear the filters, click ![Clear filters icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png) **Clear filters**.

5. Use the **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific messages. Wildcards aren't supported. You can search by the following values:
   - Sender email address
   - Subject. Use the entire subject of the message. The search is not case-sensitive.

   After you've entered the search criteria, press ENTER to filter the results.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Search** box on the main **Quarantine** page will search only quarantined items in the current view, not the entire quarantine. To search all quarantined items, use **Filter** and the resulting **Filters** flyout.

After you find a specific quarantined message, select the message to view details about it, and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).

Gmail bifurcates this message into two copies that are both routed to quarantine as phishing in Microsoft. An admin releases both of these messages to admin@contoso.com. The first released message that reaches the admin mailbox is delivered. The second released message is identified as duplicate delivery and is skipped.
