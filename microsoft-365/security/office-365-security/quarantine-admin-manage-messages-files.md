# Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or Microsoft Teams, or in standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes or Teams, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages that were detected by EOP and Defender for Office 365.

Admins can view, release, and delete all types of quarantined messages and files for all users.

Admins in organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can also manage files that were quarantined by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md) and Microsoft Teams messages that were [quarantined by zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)](zero-hour-auto-purge.md#zero-hour-auto-purge-zap-in-microsoft-teams) (currently in Preview).

Users can manage most quarantined email messages based on the _quarantine policy_ for [supported email protection features](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features). For more information about quarantine policies, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

Admins and also users (depending on the [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) for the organization) can report false positives to Microsoft from quarantine.

You view and manage quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

Watch this short video to learn how to manage quarantined messages as an admin.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Exchange Online RBAC](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo):
    - _Take action on quarantined messages for all users_: Membership in the **Organization Management**, **Security Administrator**, or **Quarantine Administrator** role groups.
    - _Submit messages from quarantine to Microsoft_:  Membership in the **Security Administrator** role group.
    - _Read-only access to quarantined messages for all users_: Membership in the **Global Reader**, **Security Reader**, or **View-Only Organization Management** role groups.
  - [Email & collaboration RBAC in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md): Membership in the **Quarantine Administrator** role group. To do quarantine procedures in Exchange Online PowerShell, you also need membership in the **Hygiene Management** role group in Exchange Online RBAC.
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, **Global Reader**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

- Quarantined messages and files are retained for a default period of time based on why they were quarantined. After the retention period expires, the messages are automatically deleted and aren't recoverable. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP and Defender for Office 365](quarantine-about.md).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage quarantined email messages

### View quarantined email

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Review** \> **Quarantine** \> **Email** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Email** tab on the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine?viewid=Email>.

On the **Email** tab, you can decrease the vertical spacing in the list by clicking :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-standard-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change list spacing to compact or normal** and then selecting :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-compact-icon.png" border="false"::: **Compact list**.

You can sort the entries by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. The default values are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):

- **Time received**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Subject**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Sender**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Quarantine reason**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Release status**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Policy type**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Expires**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Recipient**
- **Message ID**
- **Policy name**
- **Message size**
- **Mail direction**
- **Recipient tag**

To filter the entries, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter**. The following filters are available in the **Filters** flyout that opens:

- **Message ID**: The globally unique identifier of the message.

  For example, you used [message trace](message-trace-scc.md) to look for a message, and you determine that the message was quarantined instead of delivered. Be sure to include the full message ID value, which might include angle brackets (\<\>). For example: `<79239079-d95a-483a-aacf-e954f592a0f6@XYZPR00BM0200.contoso.com>`.

- **Sender address**
- **Recipient address**
- **Subject**
- **Time received**:
  - **Last 24 hours**
  - **Last 7 days**
  - **Last 14 days**
  - **Last 30 days** (default)
  - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
- **Expires**: Filter messages by when they expire from quarantine:
  - **Today**
  - **Next 2 days**
  - **Next 7 days**
  - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
- **Recipient tag**
- **Quarantine reason**:
  - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)
  - **Bulk**
  - **Spam**
  - **Malware**: Anti-malware policies in EOP or Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365. The **Policy Type** value indicates which feature was used.
  - **Phishing**: The spam filter verdict was **Phishing** or anti-phishing protection quarantined the message ([spoof settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) or [impersonation protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)).
  - **High confidence phishing**
- **Recipient**: **All users** or **Only me**. End users can only manage quarantined messages sent to them.
- **Release status**: Any of the following values:
  - **Needs review**
  - **Approved**
  - **Denied**
  - **Release requested**
  - **Released**
  - **Preparing to release**
  - **Error**
- **Policy Type**: Filter messages by policy type:
  - **Anti-malware policy**
  - **Safe Attachments policy**
  - **Anti-phishing policy**
  - **Anti-spam policy**
  - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)

When you're finished in the **Filters** flyout, select **Apply**. To clear the filters, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear filters**.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific messages. Wildcards aren't supported. You can search by the following values:

- Sender email address
- Subject. Use the entire subject of the message. The search isn't case-sensitive.

After you've entered the search criteria, press the enter ENTER key to filter the results.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Search** box searches for quarantined items in the current view, not all quarantined items. To search all quarantined items, use **Filter** and the resulting **Filters** flyout.

After you find a specific quarantined message, select the message to view details about it and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).

> [!TIP]
> On mobile devices, the previously described controls are available under :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More**.

#### Release quarantined email

This action isn't available for email messages that have already been released (the **Release status** value is **Released**).

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

- You can't release a message to the same recipient more than once.
- When you select individual original recipients to receive the released message, you can select only recipients who haven't already received the released message.
- Members of the **Security Administrators** role group can see and use the **Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection** and **Allow email with similar attributes** options.
- Users can report false positives to Microsoft from quarantine, depending on the value of the **Reporting from quarantine** setting in [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md).

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to release it:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-check-mark-icon.png" border="false"::: **Release**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-check-mark-icon.png" border="false"::: **Release email**.

In the **Release email to recipient inboxes** flyout that opens, configure the following options:

- Select one of the following values:
  - **Release to all recipients**
  - **Release to one or more of the original recipients of the email**: Enter the recipients in the **Recipients** box that appears.

- **Send a copy of this message to another recipient**: If you select this option, select one or more recipients by clicking in the **Recipients** box that appears.

- **Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection**: If you select this option, the erroneously quarantined message is reported to Microsoft as a false positive. Depending on the results of their analysis, the service-wide spam filter rules might be adjusted to allow the message through.

  Selecting this option reveals the following options:

  - **Allow email with similar attributes**: If you select this option, allow entries are added to the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md) for the sender and any related URLs or attachments in the message. The following options also appear:
    - **Remove entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can also select **1 day**, **7 days**, or a **Specific date** that's less than 30 days.
    - **Allow entry note**: Enter an optional note that contains additional information.

When you're finished on the **Release email to recipient inboxes** flyout, select **Release message**.

Back on the **Email** tab, the **Release status** value of the message is **Released**.

#### Approve or deny release requests from users for quarantined email

Users can request the release of email messages if the quarantine policy used **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** (`PermissionToRequestRelease` permission) instead of **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** (`PermissionToRelease` permission) when the message was quarantined. For more information, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).

After a recipient requests the release of the email message, the **Release status** value changes to **Release requested**, and an admin can approve or deny the request.

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to approve or deny the release request:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Approve release** or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-deny-icon.png" border="false"::: **Deny**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** and then select **Approve release** or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-deny-icon.png" border="false"::: **Deny release**.

If you select **Approve release**, an **Approve release** flyout opens where you can review information about the message. To approve the request, select **Approve release**. A **Release approved** flyout opens where you can select the link to learn more about releasing messages. Select **Done** when you're finished on the **Release approved** flyout. Back on the **Email** tab, the **Release status** value of the message changes to **Approved**.

If you select **Deny**, a **Deny release** flyout opens where you can review information about the message. To deny the request, select **Deny release**. A **Release denied** flyout opens where you can select the link to learn more about releasing messages. Select **Done** when you're finished on the **Release denied** flyout. Back on the **Email** tab, the **Release status** value of the message changes to **Denied**.

#### Delete email from quarantine

When you delete an email message from quarantine, the message is removed and isn't sent to the original recipients.

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to remove it:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete from quarantine**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete from quarantine**.

In the **Delete (n) messages from quarantine** flyout that opens, use one of the following methods to delete the message:

- Select **Permanently delete the message from quarantine** and then select **Delete**: The message is permanently deleted and isn't recoverable.
- Select **Delete** only: The message is deleted, but is potentially recoverable.

After you select **Delete** on the **Delete (n) messages from quarantine** flyout, you return to the **Email** tab where the message is no longer listed.

#### Preview email from quarantine

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to preview it:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-preview-message-icon.png" border="false"::: **Preview message**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-preview-message-icon.png" border="false"::: **Preview message**.

In the flyout that opens, choose one of the following tabs:
  - **Source**: Shows the HTML version of the message body with all links disabled.
  - **Plain text**: Shows the message body in plain text.

#### View email message headers

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to view the message headers:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-message-headers-icon.png" border="false"::: **View message headers**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-message-headers-icon.png" border="false"::: **View message headers**.

In the **Message header** flyout that opens, the message header (all header fields) is shown.

Use :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy message header** to copy the message header to the clipboard.

Select the **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer** link to analyze the header fields and values in depth. Paste the message header into the **Insert the message header you would like to analyze** section (CTRL+V or right-click and choose **Paste**), and then select **Analyze headers**.

#### Report email to Microsoft for review from quarantine

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to report the message to Microsoft for analysis:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit for review**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit for review**.

In the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout that opens, configure the following options:

- **Select the submission type**: Select **Email** (default), **URL**, or **File**.

- **Add the network message ID or upload the email file**: Select one of the following options:
  - **Add the email network message ID**: This value is selected by default, with the corresponding value in the box.
  - **Upload the email file (.msg or eml)**: After you select this option, select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-import-icon.png" border="false":::**Browse files** button that appears to find and select the .msg or .eml message file to submit.

- **Choose a recipient who had an issue**: Select one (preferred) or more original recipients of the message to analyze the policies that were applied to them.

- **Select a reason for submitting to Microsoft**: Choose one of the following options:

  - **Should not have been blocked (false positive)** (default): If you select this option, the following settings are available:
    - **Allow email with similar attributes**: If you select this option, allow entries are added to the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md) for the sender and any related URLs or attachments in the message. The following options also appear:

> [!TIP]
> Users can report false positives to Microsoft from quarantine, depending on the value of the **Reporting from quarantine** setting in [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md).

#### Block email senders from quarantine

The Block senders action adds the sender of the selected email message to the Blocked Senders list **in the mailbox of whomever is signed in**. Typically, this action is used by end-users if it's available to them by [quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy). For more information about users blocking senders, see [Block a mail sender](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4)

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to add the message sender to the Blocked Senders list in **your** mailbox:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-block-sender-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block sender**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-block-sender-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block sender**.

In the **Block sender** flyout that opens, review the information about the sender, and then select **Block**.

> [!TIP]
> The organization can still receive mail from the blocked sender. Messages from the sender are delivered to user Junk Email folders or to quarantine. To delete messages from the sender upon arrival, use [mail flow rules](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules) (also known as transport rules) to **Block the message**.

#### Share email from quarantine

You can send a copy of the quarantined email message, including potentially harmful content, to the specified recipients.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to send a copy of it to others:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-share-email-icon.png" border="false"::: **Share email**.

- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Download message**.

In the **Download file** flyout that opens, enter the following information:

- **Reason for downloading file**: Enter descriptive text.
- **Create password** and **Confirm password**: Enter a password that's required to open the downloaded message file.

When you're finished on the **Download file** flyout, select **Download**.

When the download is ready, a **Save As** dialog opens for you to view or change the downloaded filename and location. By default, The .eml message file is saved in a compressed file named Quarantined Messages.zip in your **Downloads** folder. If the .zip file already exists, a number is appended to the filename (for example, Quarantined Messages(1).zip).

Accept or change the downloaded file details, and then select **Save**.
