# Manage your allows and blocks in the Tenant Allow/Block List

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, you might disagree with the EOP filtering verdict. For example, a good message might be marked as bad (a false positive), or a bad message might be allowed through (a false negative).

The Tenant Allow/Block List in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal gives you a way to manually override the Microsoft 365 filtering verdicts. The Tenant Allow/Block List is used during mail flow for incoming messages (does not apply to intra-org messages) and at the time of user clicks. You can specify the following types of overrides:

- URLs to block.
- Files to block.
- Sender emails or domains to block.
- Spoofed senders to allow or block. If you override the allow or block verdict in the [spoof intelligence insight](learn-about-spoof-intelligence.md), the spoofed sender becomes a manual allow or block entry that only appears on the **Spoof** tab in the Tenant Allow/Block List. You can also manually create allow or block entries for spoofed senders here before they're detected by spoof intelligence.
- URLs to allow.
- Files to allow.
- Sender emails or domains to allow.

This article describes how to configure entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

- You specify files by using the SHA256 hash value of the file. To find the SHA256 hash value of a file in Windows, run the following command in a Command Prompt:

  ```console
  certutil.exe -hashfile "<Path>\<Filename>" SHA256
  ```

  An example value is `768a813668695ef2483b2bde7cf5d1b2db0423a0d3e63e498f3ab6f2eb13ea3a`. Perceptual hash (pHash) values are not supported.

- For senders, URLs, and file hashes, the Tenant Allow/Block List allows 500 entries each for both allows and blocks, making it a total of 1000 entries. For spoofing (spoofed senders), the total number of entries allowed is 1024.

- The maximum number of characters for each entry is:
  - File hashes = 64
  - URL = 250

- An entry should be active within 30 minutes.

- By default, entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List will expire after 30 days. You can specify a date or set them to never expire (for block type of entries).

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online before you can do the procedures in this article:
  - To add and remove values from the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need to be a member of
    - **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role group (**Security admin role**)
    - **Security Operator** role group (**Tenant AllowBlockList Manager**).
  - For read-only access to the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need to be a member of
    - **Global Reader**  role group
    - **Security Reader** role group
    - **View-Only configuration** role group

  For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  > - The **View-Only Organization Management** role group in [Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups) also gives read-only access to the feature.

## Configure the Tenant Allow/Block List

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** in the **Rules** section. To go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

### Use Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell

To allow or block emails, see [Allow or block emails using the Tenant Allow/Block List](allow-block-email-spoof.md).

To allow or block files, see [Allow or block files using the Tenant Allow/Block List](allow-block-files.md).

To allow or block URLs, see [Allow or block URLs using the Tenant Allow/Block List](allow-block-urls.md).

### What to expect after you add an allow or block entry

After you add an allow entry through the Submissions portal or a block entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List, the entry should start working immediately.

We recommend letting entries automatically expire after 30 days to see if the system has learned about the allow or block. If not, you should make another entry to give the system another 30 days to learn.
