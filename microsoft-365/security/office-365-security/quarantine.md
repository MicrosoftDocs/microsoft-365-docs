# Quarantine

The following topics provide information about the hosted quarantine for both Exchange Online and Exchange Online Protection (EOP) admins and end users:

- [Quarantine FAQ](quarantine-faq.md) - Provides general questions and answers about the quarantine for both admins and end users

- [Find and release quarantined messages as an administrator](find-and-release-quarantined-messages-as-an-administrator.md) - Describes how admins can find and release any message that resides in the quarantine in the Exchange admin center (EAC), and optionally report it as a false positive (not junk) message to Microsoft.

- [Find and Release Quarantined Messages (End Users)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/e439b560-827a-4807-abd3-6b861c1ff786.aspx) - Describes how end users can find and release their own spam-quarantined messages in the spam quarantine user interface, and report them as not junk to Microsoft.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > In order to access the end user spam quarantine, end users must have a valid Office 365 user ID and password. EOP customers protecting on-premises mailboxes must be valid email users created via directory synchronization or the EAC. For more information about managing users, EOP admins can refer to [Manage mail users in EOP](manage-mail-users-in-eop.md). For EOP standalone customers, we recommend using directory synchronization and enabling Directory Based Edge Blocking; for more information, see [Use Directory Based Edge Blocking to Reject Messages Sent to Invalid Recipients](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ca7b7416-92ed-40ad-abdb-695be46ea2e4.aspx).
