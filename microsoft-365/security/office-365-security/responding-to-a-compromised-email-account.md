# Responding to a compromised email account

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Access to Microsoft 365 mailboxes, data, and other services is controlled by credentials (for example a username and a password or PIN). When someone other than the intended user steals those credentials, the associated account is considered to be compromised.

After an attacker steals the credentials and gains access to the account, they can access the associated Microsoft 365 mailbox, SharePoint folders, or files in the user's OneDrive. Attackers often use the compromised mailbox to send email as the original user to recipients inside and outside of the organization. Attackers using email to send data to external recipients is known as _data exfiltration_.

This article explains the symptoms of account compromise and how to regain control of the compromised account.

## Symptoms of a compromised Microsoft email account

Users might notice and report unusual activity in their Microsoft 365 mailboxes. For example:

- Suspicious activity, such as missing or deleted email.
- Users receiving email from the compromised account without the corresponding email in the sender's **Sent Items** folder.
- Inbox rules that weren't created by the user or admins. These rules might automatically forward email to unknown addresses or move messages to the **Notes**, **Junk Email**, or **RSS Subscriptions** folders.
- The user's display name is changed in the Global Address List.
- The user's mailbox is blocked from sending email.
- The **Sent Items** or **Deleted Items** folders in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) contain typical messages for compromised accounts (for example, "I'm stuck in London, send money.").
- Unusual profile changes. For example, name, telephone number, or the postal code updates.
- Multiple and frequent password changes.
- Mail forwarding was recently added.
- Unusual signatures were recently added. For example, a fake banking signature or a prescription drug signature.

If a user reports these symptoms or other unusual symptoms, you should investigate. The Microsoft Defender portal and the Azure portal offer the following tools to help you investigate suspicious activity on a user account.

- **Unified audit logs in the Microsoft Defender portal**: Filter the logs for activity using a date range that starts immediately before the suspicious activity occurred to today. Don't filter on specific activities during the search. For more information, see [Search the audit log](audit-log-search-defender-portal.md).

- **Microsoft Entra sign-in logs and other risk reports in the Microsoft Entra admin center**: Examine the values in these columns:
  - Review IP address
  - sign-in locations
  - sign-in times
  - sign-in success or failure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following button lets you test and identify suspicious account activity. You can use this information to recover a compromised account.

## Secure and restore email function to a compromised Microsoft 365 account and mailbox

<!--- [!VIDEO https://videoplayercdn.osi.office.net/hub/?csid=ux-cms-en-us-msoffice&uuid=RE2jvOb&AutoPlayVideo=false] --->

Even after the user regains access to their account, the attacker might have left back-door entries that allow the attacker to resume control of the account.

Do **all** of the following steps to regain control of the account. Go through the steps as soon as you suspect a problem and as quickly as possible to make sure that the attacker doesn't resume control of the account. These steps also help you remove any back-door entries that the attacker might have added to the account. After you do these steps, we recommend that you run a virus scan to make sure that the client computer isn't compromised.

### Step 1: Reset the user's password

Follow the procedures in [Reset a business password for someone](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/reset-passwords#reset-my-admin-password).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Don't send the new password to the user through email, because the attacker still has access to the mailbox at this point.
>
> - Be sure to use a strong password: upper and lowercase letters, at least one number, and at least one special character.
>
> - Even if the password history requirement allows it, don't reuse any of the last five passwords. Use a unique password that the attacker can't guess.
>
> - If the on-premises identity is federated with Microsoft 365, you must change the on-premises account password on-premises, and then notify the administrator of the compromise.
>
> - Be sure to update app passwords. App passwords aren't automatically revoked when you reset the password. The user should delete existing app passwords and create new ones. For instructions, see [Manage app passwords for two-step verification](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/d6dc8c6d-4bf7-4851-ad95-6d07799387e9).
>
> - We highly recommended that you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the account. MFA is a good way to help prevent account compromise, and is very important for accounts with administrative privileges. For instructions, see [Set up multi-factor authentication](/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication).

### Step 2: Remove suspicious email forwarding addresses

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com>, go to **Users** \> **Active users**. Or, to go directly to the **Active users** page, use <https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/users>.

2. On the **Active users** page, find the user account, and select it by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name.

3. In the details flyout that opens, select the **Mail** tab.

4. The value **Applied** in the **Email forwarding** section indicates that mail forwarding is configured on the account.

   Select **Manage email forwarding**, clear the **Forward all email sent to this mailbox** check box in the **Manage email forwarding** flyout that opens, and then select **Save changes**.

### Step 3: Disable suspicious Inbox rules

1. Sign in to the user's mailbox using Outlook on the web.

2. Select **Settings** (gear icon), enter 'rules' in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box, and then select **Inbox rules** from the results.

3. On the **Rules** tab of the flyout that opens, review the existing rules, and turn off or delete any suspicious rules.

### Step 4: Unblock the user from sending mail

If the account was used to send spam or a high volume of email, it's likely that the mailbox has been blocked from sending mail.

To unblock a mailbox from sending email, follow the procedures in [Remove blocked users from the Restricted entities page](outbound-spam-restore-restricted-users.md).

### Step 5 Optional: Block the user account from signing-in

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can block the account from signing-in until you believe it's safe to re-enable access.

1. Do the following steps in the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com>:
   1. Go to **Users** \> **Active users**. Or, to go directly to the **Active users** page, use <https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/users>.

   4. Repeat the previous steps for each role group in the list.

### Step 7 Optional: Additional precautionary steps

1. Verify the contents of the **Sent items** folder of the account in Outlook or Outlook on the web.

   You might need to inform people in your contacts list that your account was compromised. For example, the attacker might have sent messages asking your contacts for money, or the attacker might have sent a virus to hijack their computers.

2. The accounts for any other services that use this account as an alternative email account might have also been compromised. After you do the steps in this article for the account in this Microsoft 365 organization, do these steps for your other accounts.

3. Verify the contact information (for example, telephone numbers and addresses) of the account.
