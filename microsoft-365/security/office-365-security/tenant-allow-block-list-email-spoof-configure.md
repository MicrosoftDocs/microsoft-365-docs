# Allow or block email using the Tenant Allow/Block List

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

This article describes how to create and manage allow and block entries for domains and email addresses (including spoofed senders) that are available in the Tenant Allow/Block List. For more information about the Tenant Allow/Block List, see [Manage allows and blocks in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md).

You manage allow and block entries for email in the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal or in Exchange Online PowerShell.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- For domains and email addresses, the maximum number of allow entries is 500, and the maximum number of block entries is 500 (1000 domain and email address entries in total).

- For spoofed senders, the maximum number of allow entries and block entries is 1024 (1024 allow entries and no block entries, 512 allow entries and 512 block entries, etc.).

- Entries for spoofed senders never expire.

- For details about the syntax for spoofed sender entries, see the [Domain pair syntax for spoofed sender entries](#domain-pair-syntax-for-spoofed-sender-entries) section later in this article.

- An entry should be active within 30 minutes, but it might take up to 24 hours for the entry to be active.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Exchange Online RBAC](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo):
    - _Add and remove entries from the Tenant Allow/Block List_: Membership in one of the following role groups:
      - **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** (Security admin role).
      - **Security Operator** (Tenant AllowBlockList Manager).
    - _Read-only access to the Tenant Allow/Block List_: Membership in one of the following role groups:
      - **Global Reader**
      - **Security Reader**
      - **View-Only Configuration**
      - **View-Only Organization Management**
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, **Global Reader**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

## Domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

### Create block entries for domains and email addresses

You have the following options to create block entries for domains and email addresses:

- [The Submissions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-domains-and-email-addresses-on-the-submissions-page)
- The Tenant Allow/Block List in [the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-domains-and-email-addresses-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) or in [PowerShell](#use-powershell-to-create-block-entries-for-domains-and-email-addresses-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list)

To create block entries for spoofed senders, see the [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-spoofed-senders-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) section later in this article.

By default, allow entries for domains and email addresses exist for 30 days. During those 30 days, Microsoft will learn from the allow entries and [remove them or automatically extend them](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/automatic-tenant-allow-block-list-expiration-management-is-now/ba-p/3723447). After Microsoft learns from the removed allow entries, messages that contain those entities will be delivered, unless something else in the message is detected as malicious. By default, allow entries for spoofed senders never expire.

#### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for domains and email addresses on the Submissions page

When you use the Submissions page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> to submit email messages as **Should have been blocked (False negative)**, you can select **Block all emails from this sender or domain** to add a block entry for the sender email address or domain on the **Domains & addresses** tab in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

For instructions, see [Submit questionable email to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md#report-questionable-email-to-microsoft).

#### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

You can create block entries for domains and email addresses directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

Email messages from these senders are marked as *high confidence spam* (SCL = 9). What happens to the messages is determined by the [anti-spam policy](anti-spam-policies-configure.md) that detected the message for the recipient. In the default anti-spam policy and new custom policies, messages that are marked as high confidence spam are delivered to the Junk Email folder by default. In Standard and Strict [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md), high confidence spam messages are quarantined.

> [!NOTE]
> Users in the organization can't send email to these blocked domains and addresses. They'll receive the following non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message): `550 5.7.703 Your message can't be delivered because one or more recipients are blocked by your organization's tenant recipient block policy.` The entire message is blocked for all *external* recipients of the message, even if only one recipient email address or domain is defined in a block entry.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. On the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, verify that the **Domains & addresses** tab is selected.

3. On the **Domains & addresses** tab, click ![Block icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Block**.

4. In the **Block domains & addresses** flyout that appears, configure the following settings:

   - **Domains & addresses**: Enter one email address or domain per line, up to a maximum of 20.

   - **Remove block entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
     - **1 day**
     - **7 days**
     - **30 days**
     - **Never expire**
     - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 90 days from today.

   - **Optional note**: Enter descriptive text for why you're blocking the email addresses or domains.

5. When you're finished, click **Add**.

##### Use PowerShell to create block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender -Block -Entries "DomainOrEmailAddress1","DomainOrEmailAddress1",..."DomainOrEmailAddressN" <-ExpirationDate Date | -NoExpiration> [-Notes <String>]
```

This example adds a block entry for the specified email address that expires on a specific date.

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender -Block -Entries "test@badattackerdomain.com","test2@anotherattackerdomain.com" -ExpirationDate 8/20/2022
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for domains and email addresses on the Submissions page

You can't create allow entries for domains and email addresses directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List. Instead, you use the Submissions page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> to submit the message as a false positive, which also adds an allow entry for the sender on the **Domains & addresses** tab in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

For instructions, see [Submit good email to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md#report-good-email-to-microsoft).

By default, allow entries for domains and email addresses, files, and URLs exist for 30 days. During those 30 days, Microsoft will learn from the allow entries and [remove them or automatically extend them](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/automatic-tenant-allow-block-list-expiration-management-is-now/ba-p/3723447). After Microsoft learns from the removed allow entries, messages that contain those entities will be delivered, unless something else in the message is detected as malicious.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not allow you to create allow entries directly. Unnecessary allow entries expose your organization to malicious email which could have been filtered by the system.
>
> Microsoft manages the creation of allow entries from the Submissions page. Allow entries are added during mail flow based on the filters that determined the message was malicious. For example, if the sender email address and a URL in the message were determined to be bad, an allow entry is created for the sender (email address or domain) and the URL.
>
> When the entity in the allow entry is encountered again (during mail flow or time of click), all filters associated with that entity are skipped.
>
> During mail flow, if messages containing the allowed entity pass other checks in the filtering stack, the messages will be delivered. For example, if a message passes [email authentication checks](email-authentication-about.md), URL filtering, and file filtering, a message from an allowed sender email address will be delivered.

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to view existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Verify the **Domains & addresses** tab is selected. The following columns are available:

   - **Value**: The domain or email address.
   - **Action**: The value **Allow** or **Block**.
   - **Modified by**
   - **Last updated**
   - **Remove on**: The expiration date.
   - **Notes**

   You can click on a column heading to sort in ascending or descending order.

   Click ![Search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png) **Search**, enter all or part of a value, and then press the ENTER key to find a specific value. When you're finished, click ![Clear search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-close-icon.png) **Clear search**.

   Click ![Filter icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png) **Filter** to filter the results. The following values are available in the **Filter** flyout that appears:

   - **Action**: The values are **Allow** and **Block**.
   - **Never expire**: ![Toggle on.](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png) or ![Toggle off.](../../media/scc-toggle-off.png)
   - **Last updated**: Select **From** and **To** dates.
   - **Remove on**: Select **From** and **To** dates.

   When you're finished, click **Apply**. To clear existing filters, click ![Clear filters icon](../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png) **Clear filters** in the **Filter** flyout.

#### Use PowerShell to view existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender [-Allow] [-Block] [-Entry <Domain or Email address value>] [<-ExpirationDate Date | -NoExpiration>]
```

This example returns all allow and block entries for domains and email addresses.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender
```

This example filters the results for block entries for domains and email addresses.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender -Block
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/get-tenantallowblocklistitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

You can make the following modifications to entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block list:

- **Block entries**: The expiration date and notes.
- **Allow entries**: The expiration date and notes.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Verify the **Domains & addresses** tab is selected.

3. On the **Domains & addresses** tab, select the check box of the entry that you want to modify, and then click the ![Edit icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** button that appears.

4. The following settings are available in the **Edit domain & addresses** flyout that appears:
   - **Remove block entry after**: You can extend block entries for a maximum of 90 days from the system date or set them to **Never expire**.
   - **Remove allow entry after**: You can extend allow entries for a maximum of 30 days from the system date.
   - **Optional note**

   When you're finished, click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> For entries added via submission, if you select the entry by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name, you can select ![View submission icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-submission-icon.png) **View submission** in the details flyout that opens, which takes you to the submission details that added the entry.

#### Use PowerShell to modify existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender <-Ids <Identity value> | -Entries <Value value>> [<-ExpirationDate Date | -NoExpiration>] [-Notes <String>]
```

This example changes the expiration date of the specified block entry for the sender email address.

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender -Entries "julia@fabrikam.com" -ExpirationDate "9/1/2022"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/set-tenantallowblocklistitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to remove existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses in the Tenant Allow/Block List

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Verify the **Domains & addresses** tab is selected.

3. On **Domains & addresses** tab, do one of the following steps:

   - Select the check box of the entry that you want to remove, and then click the ![Delete icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png) **Delete** icon that appears.

4. In the warning dialog that appears, click **Delete**.

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple entries by selecting each check box, or select all entries by selecting the check box next to the **Value** column header.

#### Use PowerShell to remove existing allow or block entries for domains and email addresses from the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender <-Ids <Identity value> | -Entries <Value value>>
```

This example removes the specified entry for domains and email addresses from the Tenant Allow/Block List.

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Sender -Entries "adatum.com"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-tenantallowblocklistitems).

## Spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

### Create allow entries for spoofed senders

You have the following options to create block entries for spoofed senders:

- [The Submissions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-allow-entries-for-domains-and-email-addresses-on-the-submissions-page)
- The Tenant Allow/Block List in [the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-allow-entries-for-spoofed-senders-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) or in [PowerShell](#use-powershell-to-create-block-entries-for-spoofed-senders-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list)

> [!NOTE]
> Allow entries for spoofed senders take care of intra-org, cross-org, and DMARC spoofing.
>
> Only the combination of the spoofed user *and* the sending infrastructure as defined in the [domain pair](#domain-pair-syntax-for-spoofed-sender-entries) is allowed to spoof.
>
> When you configure an allow entry for a domain pair, messages from that domain pair no longer appear in the [spoof intelligence insight](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md).
>
> Allow entries for spoofed senders never expire.

#### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for spoofed senders on the Submissions page

Submitting messages that were blocked by [spoof intelligence](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md) to Microsoft in the **Submissions** portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> adds the sender as an allow entry for the sender on the **Spoofed senders** tab in Tenant Allow/Block List.

For instructions, see [Submit good email to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md#report-good-email-to-microsoft).

> [!NOTE]
> When you override the verdict in the spoof intelligence insight, the spoofed sender becomes a manual allow or block entry that only appears on the **Spoofed senders** tab in the Tenant Allow/Block List.
>
> If the sender has not been blocked by spoof intelligence, submitting the email message to Microsoft won't create an allow entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

#### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In the Tenant Allow/Block List, you can create allow entries for spoofed senders before they're detected and blocked by [spoof intelligence](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md).

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. On the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, select the **Spoofed senders** tab, and then click ![Add icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Add**.

3. In the **Add new domain pairs** flyout that appears, configure the following settings:

   - **Add domain pairs with wildcards**: Enter domain pair per line, up to a maximum of 20. For details about the syntax for spoofed sender entries, see the [Domain pair syntax for spoofed sender entries](#domain-pair-syntax-for-spoofed-sender-entries) section later in this article.

   - **Spoof type**: Select one of the following values:
     - **Internal**: The spoofed sender is in a domain that belongs to your organization (an [accepted domain](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains)).
     - **External**: The spoofed sender is in an external domain.

   - **Action**: Select **Allow** or **Block**.

   When you're finished, click **Add**.

##### Use PowerShell to create allow entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity Default -Action Allow -SpoofedUser <Domain | EmailAddress> -SendingInfrastructure <Domain | IPAddress/24> -SpoofType <External | Internal>
```

This example creates an allow entry for the sender bob@contoso.com from the source contoso.com.

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity Default -Action Allow -SendingInfrastructure contoso.com -SpoofedUser bob@contoso.com -SpoofType External
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems](/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistspoofitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

You can create block entries for spoofed senders directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List. The steps are nearly identical to [creating allow entries for spoofed senders](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-allow-entries-for-spoofed-senders-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) as previously described in this article.

The only difference is: for the **Action** value in Step 3, choose **Block** instead of **Allow**.

> [!NOTE]
> Email messages from these senders are blocked as *phishing*.
>
> Only the combination of the spoofed user *and* the sending infrastructure as defined in the [domain pair](#domain-pair-syntax-for-spoofed-sender-entries) is blocked from spoofing.
>
> When you configure a block entry for a domain pair, messages from that domain pair no longer appear in the [spoof intelligence insight](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md).
>
> Block entries for spoofed senders never expire.

#### Use PowerShell to create block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity Default -Action Block -SpoofedUser <Domain | EmailAddress> -SendingInfrastructure <Domain | IPAddress/24> -SpoofType <External | Internal>
```

This example creates a block entry for the sender laura@adatum.com from the source 172.17.17.17/24.

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity Default -Action Allow -SendingInfrastructure 172.17.17.17/24 -SpoofedUser laura@adatum.com -SpoofType External
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems](/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistspoofitems).

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems [-Action <Allow | Block>] [-SpoofType <External | Internal>
```

This example returns all spoofed sender entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems
```

This example returns all allow spoofed sender entries that are internal.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Action Allow -SpoofType Internal
```

This example returns all blocked spoofed sender entries that are external.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Action Block -SpoofType External
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems](/powershell/module/exchange/get-tenantallowblocklistspoofitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify existing allow or block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

When you modify an allow or block entry for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block list, you can only change the entry from **Allow** to **Block**, or vice-versa.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Select the **Spoofed senders** tab.

3. On the **Spoofed senders** tab, select the entry that you want to modify, and then click the ![Edit icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** button that appears.

4. In the **Edit spoofed sender** flyout that appears, choose **Allow** or **Block**.

5. When you're finished, click **Save**.

#### Use PowerShell to modify existing allow or block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity Default -Ids <Identity value> -Action <Allow | Block>
```

This example changes spoofed sender entry from allow to block.

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -Identity Default -Ids 3429424b-781a-53c3-17f9-c0b5faa02847 -Action Block
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems](/powershell/module/exchange/set-tenantallowblocklistspoofitems).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to remove existing allow or block entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Select the **Spoofed senders** tab.

3. On the **Spoofed senders** tab, select the entry that you want to remove, and then click the ![Delete icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png) **Delete** icon that appears.

4. In the warning dialog that appears, click **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select multiple entries by selecting each check box, or selecting all entries by selecting the check box next to the **Spoofed user** column header.

#### Use PowerShell to remove existing allow or block entries for spoofed senders from the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity domain.com\Default -Ids <Identity value>
```

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListSpoofItems -Identity domain.com\Default -Ids d86b3b4b-e751-a8eb-88cc-fe1e33ce3d0c

### Domain pair syntax for spoofed sender entries

A domain pair for a spoofed sender in the Tenant Allow/Block List uses the following syntax: `<Spoofed user>, <Sending infrastructure>`.

- **Spoofed user**: This value involves the email address of the spoofed user that's displayed in the **From** box in email clients. This address is also known as the `5322.From` address. Valid values include:
  - An individual email address (for example, chris@contoso.com).
  - An email domain (for example, contoso.com).
  - The wildcard character (for example, \*).

- **Sending infrastructure**: This value indicates the source of messages from the spoofed user. Valid values include:
  - The domain found in a reverse DNS lookup (PTR record) of the source email server's IP address (for example, fabrikam.com).
  - If the source IP address has no PTR record, then the sending infrastructure is identified as \<source IP\>/24 (for example, 192.168.100.100/24).
  - A verified DKIM domain.

Here are some examples of valid domain pairs to identify spoofed senders:

- `contoso.com, 192.168.100.100/24`
- `chris@contoso.com, fabrikam.com`
- `*, contoso.net`

Adding a domain pair only allows or blocks the *combination* of the spoofed user *and* the sending infrastructure. It does not allow email from the spoofed user from any source, nor does it allow email from the sending infrastructure source for any spoofed user.

For example, you add an allow entry for the following domain pair:

- **Domain**: gmail.com
- **Sending infrastructure**: tms.mx.com

Only messages from that domain *and* sending infrastructure pair are allowed to spoof. Other senders attempting to spoof gmail.com aren't allowed. Messages from senders in other domains originating from tms.mx.com are checked by spoof intelligence.

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify wildcards in the sending infrastructure or in the spoofed user, but not in both at the same time. For example, `*, *` is not permitted.

## About impersonated domains or senders

You can't create allow entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List for messages that were detected as [domain or sender impersonation protection in Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

Submitting a message that was incorrectly blocked as impersonation on the Submissions page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> does not add the sender or domain as an allow entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

Instead, the domain or sender is added to the **Trusted senders and domains section** in the [anti-phishing policy](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-modify-anti-phishing-policies) that detected the message.

The instructions to submit the message are identical to the steps in [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for domains and email addresses in the Submissions page](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-allow-entries-for-domains-and-email-addresses-on-the-submissions-page).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Graph Impersonation is not taken care from here.
