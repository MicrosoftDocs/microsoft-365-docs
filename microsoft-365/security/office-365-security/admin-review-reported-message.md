# Admin review for reported messages

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes and Microsoft Defender for Office 365, admins can send templated messages back to end users after they review reported messages. The templates can be customized for your organization and based on your admin's verdict as well.

The feature is designed to give feedback to your users but doesn't change the verdicts of messages in the system. To help Microsoft update and improve its filters, you need to submit messages for analysis using [Admin submission](submissions-admin.md).

You will only be able to mark and notify users of review results if the message was reported as a [false positives or false negatives](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>. To go directly to the **User reported** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user>.

- To modify the configuration for User reported messages, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:
  - Organization Management or Security Administrator in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md).
  - Organization Management in [Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups).

- You'll also need access to Exchange Online PowerShell. If the account that you're trying to use doesn't have access to Exchange Online PowerShell, you'll receive an error that says *Specify an email address in your domain*. For more information about enabling or disabling access to Exchange Online PowerShell, see the following topics:
  - [Enable or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell)
  - [Client Access Rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/client-access-rules/client-access-rules)

## Notify users from within the portal

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to the **Submissions** page at **Email & collaboration** \> **Submissions** \> **User reported** tab. To go directly to the **User reported** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user>.

2. On the **User reported** tab, find and select the message, select **Mark as and notify**, and then select one of the following values from the dropdown list:
   - **No threats found**
   - **Phishing**
   - **Junk**

The reported message will be marked as either false positive or false negative, and an email will be automatically sent from within the portal notifying the user who reported the message.

## Customize the messages used to notify users

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to the **User reported** page at **Settings** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **User reported** tab. To go directly to the **User reported** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission>.

2. On the **User reported** page, verify that the toggle at the top of the page is ![Toggle On](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png) **On**.

3. Find the **Email sent to user after admin review** section and configure one or more of the following settings:

   - **Specify an Office 365 mailbox to send email notifications from**: Select this option and enter the sender's email address in the box that appears.
   - **Replace the Microsoft logo with my company logo**: Select this option to replace the default Microsoft logo that's used in notifications. Before you do this step, you need to follow the instructions in [Customize the Microsoft 365 theme for your organization](../../admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme.md) to upload your custom logo. This option is not supported if your organization has a custom logo pointing to a URL instead of an uploaded image file.
   - **Customize email notification messages**: Click this link to customize the email notification that's sent after an admin reviews and marks a reported message. In the **Customize admin review email notifications** flyout that appears, configure the following settings on the **Phishing**, **Junk** and **No threats found** tabs:
     - **Email box results text**: Enter the custom text to use.
       - **Footer** tab: The following options are available:
       - **Email footer text**: Enter the custom message footer text to use.

     When you're finished on the **Customize admin review email notifications** flyout, click **Confirm**.

4. When you're finished, click **Save**. To clear these values, click **Restore** on the **User reported** page.
