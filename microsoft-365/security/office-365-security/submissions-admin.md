# Use the Submissions page to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, legitimate email getting blocked, and email attachments to Microsoft

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes, admins can use the **Submissions** page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to submit messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft for analysis. There are two basic types of admin submissions:

- **Admin-originated submissions**: Admins identify and report messages, attachments, or URLs (entities) by selecting :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** from the tabs on the **Submissions** page as described in the [Admin-originated submissions](#admin-originated-submissions) section.

  After the admin reports the entity, an entry appears on the corresponding tab on the **Submissions** page (anywhere except the **User reported** tab).

- **Admin submission of user reported messages**: The built-in [user reporting experience](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) is turned on and configured. User reported messages appear on the **User reported** tab on the **Submissions** page, and admins submit or resubmit the messages to Microsoft from the **User reported** tab.

  After an admin submits the message, an entry is also created on the corresponding tab on the **Submissions** page (for example, the **Emails** tab). These types of admin submissions are described in the [Admin options for user reported messages](#admin-options-for-user-reported-messages) section.

When admins submit email messages for analysis, Microsoft does the following checks:

- **Email authentication check**: Whether email authentication passed or failed when it was delivered.
- **Policy hits**: Information about any policies or overrides that might have allowed or blocked the incoming email into the organization, thus overriding our filtering verdicts.
- **Payload reputation/detonation**: Up-to-date examination of any URLs and attachments in the message.
- **Grader analysis**: Review done by human graders to confirm whether or not messages are malicious.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In U.S. Government organizations (Microsoft 365 GCC, GCC High, and DoD), admins can submit messages to Microsoft for analysis, but the messages are analyzed for email authentication and policy checks only. Payload reputation, detonation, and grader analysis aren't done for compliance reasons (data isn't allowed to leave the organization boundary).

Watch this short video to learn how to use admin submissions in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to submit messages to Microsoft for evaluation.

For more information about how **users** can submit messages and files to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](submissions-report-messages-files-to-microsoft.md).

For other ways that **admins** can report messages to Microsoft in the Defender portal, see [Related reporting settings for admins](submissions-report-messages-files-to-microsoft.md#related-reporting-settings-for-admins).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/>. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Email & collaboration RBAC in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md): Membership in the **Security Administrator** or **Security Reader** role groups.
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Security Administrator** or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

- Admins can submit email messages as old as 30 days if they're still available in the mailbox and haven't been purged by the user or an admin.

- Admin submissions are throttled at the following rates:
  - Maximum submissions in any 15-minute period: 150 submissions
  - Same submissions in a 24 hour period: Three submissions
  - Same submissions in a 15-minute period: One submission

- A **Files** tab is available on the **Submissions** page only in organizations with Microsoft 365 Defender or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2. For information and instructions to submit files from the **Files** tab, see [Submit files in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/admin-submissions-mde.md).

## Admin-originated submissions

> [!TIP]
> The tab where you select select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** doesn't particularly matter, as long as you set **Select the submission type** to the correct value.

### Report good email to Microsoft

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Actions & submissions** \> **Submissions**. Or, to go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

2. On the **Submissions** page, verify that the **Emails** tab is selected.

3. On the **Emails** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit to Microsoft for analysis**.

4. In the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout that opens, enter the following information:

   - **Select the submission type**: Verify the value **Email** is selected.

   - **Add the network message ID or upload the email file**: Select one of the following options:
     - **Add the email network message ID**: The GUID value is available in the **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Network-Message-Id** header in the message or in the **X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id** header in quarantined messages.
     - **Upload the email file (.msg or .eml)**: Select **Browse files**. In the dialog that opens, find and select the .eml or .msg file, and then select **Open**.

   - **Choose a recipient who had an issue**: Specify the recipients to run a policy check against. The policy check determines if the email was blocked due to user or organization policies or overrides.

   - **Select a reason for submitting to Microsoft**: Select **Should not have been blocked (False positive)**, and then configure the following settings:

     - **Allow emails with similar attributes (URL, sender, etc.)**: Turn on this setting :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.

         - **Remove allow entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
           - **1 day**
           - **7 days**
           - **30 days**
           - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 30 days from today.

           For spoofed senders, this value is meaningless, because entries for spoofed senders never expire.

         - **Allow entry note**: Enter optional information about why you're allowing and submitting this email message.

           For spoofed senders, any value you enter here isn't shown in the allow entry on the **Spoofed senders** tab on the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page.

   When you're finished in the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout, select **Submit**, and then select **Done**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/admin-submission-email-allow.png" alt-text="Submit a false positive (good) email to Microsoft for analysis on the Submissions page in the Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/admin-submission-email-allow.png":::

After a few moments, the associated allow entries appear on the **Domains & addresses**, **Spoofed senders**, **URLs**, or **Files** tabs on the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Allow entries are added during mail flow based on the filters that determined the message was malicious. For example, if the sender email address and a URL in the message were determined to be bad, an allow entry is created for the sender (email address or domain) and the URL.
> - If the sender email address is not found to be malicious by our filtering system, submitting the email message to Microsoft won't create an allow entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List.
> - When an allowed domain or email address, spoofed sender, URL, or file (_entity_) is encountered again, all filters that are associated with the entity are skipped. For email messages, all other entities are still evaluated by the filtering system before making a decision.
> - During mail flow, if messages from the allowed domain or email address pass other checks in the filtering stack, the messages are delivered. For example, if a message passes [email authentication checks](email-authentication-about.md), a message from an allowed sender email address are delivered.
> - By default, allow entries for domains and email addresses exist for 30 days. During those 30 days, Microsoft learns from the allow entries and [removes them or automatically extends them](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/automatic-tenant-allow-block-list-expiration-management-is-now/ba-p/3723447). After Microsoft learns from the removed allow entries, messages from those domains or email addresses are delivered, unless something else in the message is detected as malicious. By default, allow entries for spoofed senders never expire.
> - For messages that were incorrectly blocked by [domain or user impersonation protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365), the allow entry for the domain or sender is not created in the Tenant Allow/Block List. Instead, the domain or sender is added to the **Trusted senders and domains** section in the [anti-phishing policy](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-modify-anti-phishing-policies) that detected the message.
> - When you override the verdict in the spoof intelligence insight, the spoofed sender becomes a manual allow or block entry that only appears on the **Spoofed senders** on the **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList?viewid=SpoofItem>.

         - **Remove allow entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
           - **1 day**
           - **7 days**
           - **30 days**
           - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 30 days from today.

         - **Allow entry note**: Enter optional information about why you're allowing and submitting this file.

   When you're finished in the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout, select **Submit**, and then select **Done**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/admin-submission-file-allow.png" alt-text="Submit a false positive (good) email attachment to Microsoft for analysis on the Submissions page in the Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/admin-submission-file-allow.png":::

After a few moments, the allow entry is available on the **Files** tab on the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page. For more information about the Tenant Allow/Block List, see [Manage allows and blocks in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md).

### Report good URLs to Microsoft

For URLs reported as false positives, we allow subsequent messages that contain variations of the original URL. For example, you use the **Submissions** page to report the incorrectly blocked URL `www.contoso.com/abc`. If your organization later receives a message that contains the URL (for example but not limited to: `www.contoso.com/abc`, `www.contoso.com/abc?id=1`, `www.contoso.com/abc/def/gty/uyt?id=5`, or `*.contoso.com/abc`), the message won't be blocked based on the URL. In other words, you don't need to report multiple variations of the same URL as good to Microsoft.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Actions & submissions** \> **Submissions**. Or, to go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

2. On the **Submissions** page, select the **URLs** tab

3. On the **URLs** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Submit to Microsoft for analysis**.

4. In the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout that opens, enter the following information:

   - **Select the submission type**: Verify the value **URL** is selected.

   - **URL**: Enter the full URL (for example, `https://www.fabrikam.com/marketing.html`), and then select it in the box that appears. You can also provide a top level domain (for example, `https://www.fabrikam.com/*`), and then select it in the box that appears. You can enter up to 50 URL at once.

   - **Select a reason for submitting to Microsoft**: Select **Should not have been blocked (False positive)**, and then configure the following settings:

     - **Allow this URL**: Turn on this setting :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.

         - **Remove allow entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
           - **1 day**
           - **7 days**
           - **30 days**
           - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 30 days from today.

         - **Allow entry note**: Enter optional information about why you're allowing and submitting this URL.

   When you're finished in the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout, select **Submit**, and then select **Done**.
