# Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

The Security & Compliance Center lets you grant permissions to people who perform compliance tasks like device management, data loss prevention, eDiscovery, retention, and so on. These people can perform only the tasks that you explicitly grant them access to. To access the Security & Compliance Center, users need to be a global administrator or a member of one or more Security & Compliance Center role groups.

Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model. RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by Exchange, so if you're familiar with Exchange, granting permissions in the Security & Compliance Center will be very similar. It's important to remember, however, that Exchange role groups and Security & Compliance Center role groups don't share membership or permissions. While both have an Organization Management role group, they aren't the same. The permissions they grant, and the members of the role groups, are different. There's a list of Security & Compliance Center role groups below.

![Permissions page in the Security & Compliance Center.](../../media/992c20ca-e82e-497c-9c8d-6fab212deb80.png)

## Relationship of members, roles, and role groups

A **role** grants permissions to do a set of tasks; for example, the Case Management role lets people work with eDiscovery cases.

A **role group** is a set of roles that lets people do their jobs across the Security & Compliance Center. For example, the Compliance Administrator role group includes (among other roles) the roles for Case Management, Content Search, and Organization Configuration (plus others) because someone who's a compliance admin will need the permissions for those tasks to do their job.

The Security & Compliance Center includes default role groups for the most common tasks and functions that you'll need to assign people to. We recommend simply adding individual users as **members** to the default role groups.

![Diagram showing relationship of role groups to roles and members.](../../media/2a16d200-968c-4755-98ec-f1862d58cb8b.png)

## Role groups in the Security & Compliance Center

The following table lists the default role groups that are available in the Security & Compliance Center, and the roles that are assigned to the role groups by default. To grant permissions to a user to perform a compliance task, add them to the appropriate Security & Compliance Center role group.

Managing permissions in the Security & Compliance Center only gives users access to the compliance features that are available within the Security & Compliance Center itself. If you want to grant permissions to other compliance features that aren't in the Security & Compliance Center, such as Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), you need to use the Exchange admin center (EAC). For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

To see how to grant access to the Security & Compliance Center, check out [Give users access to Microsoft 365 Compliance admin center](grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Permissions** tab in the Security & Compliance Center, you need to be an admin. Specifically, you need to be assigned the **Role Management** role, and that role is assigned only to the **Organization Management** role group in the Security & Compliance Center by default. Furthermore, the **Role Management** role allows users to view, create, and modify role groups.

After the user accesses an Advanced eDiscovery case, they can select **Review sets** to access case data.

Members of this role group can only access the data in a review set.|Review|
|**Security Administrator**|Members have access to a number of security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and Security & Compliance Center. <p> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members.

Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Administrator role from Azure Active Directory. <p> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Azure Active Directory admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> This role group doesn't assign members the permissions necessary to search the audit log or to use any reports that might include Exchange data, such as the DLP or Defender for Office 365 reports. To search the audit log or to view all reports, a user has to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online. This is because the underlying cmdlet used to search the audit log is an Exchange Online cmdlet. Global admins can search the audit log and view all reports because they're automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Search the audit log in the Security & Compliance Center](../../compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md).
