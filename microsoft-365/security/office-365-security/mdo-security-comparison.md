# Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security comparison

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

This article introduces you to your new Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security properties in the cloud. Whether you're part of a Security Operations Center, you're a Security Administrator new to the space, or you want a refresher, let's get started.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you're using **Outlook.com**, **Microsoft 365 Family**, or **Microsoft 365 Personal**, and need *Safe Links* or *Safe Attachments* information, ***go here***: [Advanced Outlook.com security for Microsoft 365 subscribers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/advanced-outlook-com-security-for-office-365-subscribers-882d2243-eab9-4545-a58a-b36fee4a46e2).

## What is Defender for Office 365 security

Every Microsoft 365 subscription comes with security capabilities. The goals and available actions depend on the focus of these different subscriptions. In Microsoft 365 security, there are three main security services (or products) tied to your subscription type:

1. Exchange Online Protection (EOP).
1. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 365 Plan 1 (Defender for Office 365 P1).
1. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 365 Plan 2 (Defender for Office 365 P2).

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to your subscription and would like to know your license before you begin, go the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/subscriptions>.

Microsoft 365 security builds on the core protections offered by EOP. EOP is present in any subscription where Exchange Online mailboxes can be found (remember, all the security products discussed here are cloud-based).

You may be accustomed to seeing these three components discussed in this way:

|EOP|Defender for Office 365 P1|Defender for Office 365 P2|
|---|---|---|
|Prevents broad, volume-based, known attacks.|Protects email and collaboration from zero-day malware, phish, and business email compromise.|Adds post-breach investigation, hunting, and response, as well as automation, and simulation (for training).|

But in terms of architecture, let's start by thinking of each piece as cumulative layers of security, each with a security emphasis. More like this:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/tp_GraphicEOPATPP1P2_2.png" alt-text="EOP and Defender for Office 365 and their relationships to one another with service emphasis, including a note for email authentication." lightbox="../../media/tp_GraphicEOPATPP1P2_2.png":::

Though each of these services emphasizes a goal from among Protect, Detect, Investigate, and Respond, ***all*** the services can carry out ***any*** of the goals of protecting, detecting, investigating, and responding.

The core of Microsoft 365 security is EOP protection. Defender for Office 365 P1 contains EOP. Defender for Office 365 P2 contains P1 and EOP plus more features. The structure is cumulative. That's why, when configuring this product, you should start with EOP and work up to Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.

Though email authentication configuration takes place in public DNS, it's important to configure this feature to help defend against spoofing. *If you have EOP,* ***you should [configure email authentication](email-authentication-about.md)***.

If you have a Microsoft 365 E3 or virtually any subscription with Exchange Online mailboxes, you definitely have EOP. You can most likely purchase Defender for Office 365 as an add-on subscription. If you have Microsoft 365 E5, you already have Defender for Office 365 P2.

> [!TIP]
> If your subscription is neither Microsoft 365 E3 or E5, you can use [this page](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/exchange/advance-threat-protection#coreui-contentrichblock-x07wids) to see if you can upgrade to Defender for Office 365 (check the end of the page for the fine-print).

## The Microsoft 365 security ladder from EOP to Defender for Office 365

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Learn the details on these pages: [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md), and [Defender for Office 365](defender-for-office-365.md).

What makes adding Defender for Office 365 plans an advantage to pure EOP threat management can be difficult to tell at first glance. To determine if an upgrade path is right for your organization, let's look at the capabilities of each product when it comes to:

- Preventing and detecting threats
- Investigating
- Responding

The capabilities of **Exchange Online Protection** are summarized in the following table:

|Prevent/Detect|Investigate|Respond|
|---|---|---|
|Technologies include:<ul><li>Spam</li><li>Phishing</li><li>Malware</li><li>Bulk mail</li><li>Spoof intelligence</li><li>Quarantine</li><li>False positives and false negative reporting by admin submissions and user reported messages</li><li>Allow and block entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List for: <ul><li>Domains and email addresses</li><li>Spoof</li><li>URLs</li><li>Files</li></ul></li></ul>|<ul><li>Audit log search</li><li>Message Trace</li><li>Email security reports</li></ul>|<ul><li>Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)</li><li>Refinement and testing of entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List</li></ul>|

If you want to dig in to EOP, **[jump to this article](eop-about.md)**.

If you evaluate and ultimately purchase **Defender for Office 365 P1**, you get these additional capabilities over EOP:

|Prevent/Detect|Investigate|Respond|
|---|---|---|
|<ul><li>Safe Attachments in email</li><li>Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams</li><li>Safe Links in email, Office clients, and Teams</li><li>Advanced anti-phishing thresholds in anti-phishing policies</li><li>User, domain, and mailbox intelligence impersonation protection in anti-phishing policies</li><li>Alerts, and SIEM integration API for alerts</li></ul>|<ul><li>SIEM integration API for detections</li><li>**Real-time detections**</li><li>URL trace</li><li>Specific Defender for Office 365 reports</li></ul>|<li>Same</li></ul>

So, Defender for Office 365 P1 expands on the ***prevention*** side of the house, and adds extra forms of ***detection***.

Defender for Office 365 P1 also adds **Real-time detections** for investigations. The presence of **Real-time detections** as a selection in the Microsoft Defender portal means you have Defender for Office 365 P1.

If you evaluate and ultimately purchase **Defender for Office 365 P2**, you get these additional capabilities over EOP and Defender for Office 365 P1:

|Prevent/Detect|Investigate|Respond|
|---|---|---|
|<ul><li>Attack simulation training</li>|<li>**Threat Explorer**</li><li>Threat Trackers</li><li>Campaign views</li>|<li>Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)</li><li>AIR from Threat Explorer</li><li>AIR for compromised users</li><li>SIEM Integration API for Automated Investigations</li>

So, Defender for Office 365 P2 expands on the ***investigation and response*** side of the house, and adds a new hunting strength: Automation.

In Defender for Office 365 P2, the primary hunting tool is called **Threat Explorer** rather than Real-time detections. If you see Threat Explorer when you navigate to the Microsoft Defender portal, you're in Defender for Office 365 P2.

> [!TIP]
> EOP and Defender for Office 365 are also different when it comes to users. In EOP and Defender for Office 365 P1, the focus is *awareness*. The [Microsoft Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins](submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure.md) are available for users to report messages that they find suspicious.
>
> In Defender for Office 365 P2 (which contains everything in EOP and P1), the focus shifts to *further training* for end-users. The Security Operations Center has access to a powerful *Threat Simulator* tool, and the end-user metrics it provides.

## Where to go next

If you're a Security Admin, you may need to configure DKIM or DMARC for your mail. You may want to roll out 'Strict' security presets for your priority users, or look for what's new in the product. Or if you're with Security Ops, you may want to use Real-time detections or Threat Explorer to investigate and respond, or train end-user detection with Attack Simulator. Either way, here are some additional recommendations for what to look at next:

[Email Authentication, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (with links to setup of all three)](email-authentication-about.md)
