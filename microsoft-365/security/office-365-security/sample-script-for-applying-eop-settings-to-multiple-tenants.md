# Sample script for applying EOP settings to multiple tenants

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]


The following sample script lets Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) admins who manage multiple tenants (companies) use Exchange Online PowerShell to view and/or apply configuration settings to their tenants.

## To run a script or cmdlet on multiple tenants

1. If you haven't already, [install the Exchange Online V2 module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2#install-and-maintain-the-exo-v2-module).

2. Using an spreadsheet app (for example, Excel), create a .csv file with the following details:

   - UserName column: The account that you'll use to connect (for example, `admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`).
   - Cmdlet column: The cmdlet or command to run (for example, `Get-AcceptedDomain` or `Get-AcceptedDomain | FT Name`).

   The file will look like this:

   ```text
   UserName,Cmdlet
   admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com,Get-AcceptedDomain | FT Name
   admin@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com,Get-AcceptedDomain | FT Name
   ```

3. Save the .csv file in a location that's easy to find (for example, c:\scripts\inputfile.csv).

4. Copy the [RunCmdletOnMultipleTenants.ps1](#runcmdletonmultipletenantsps1) script into Notepad, and then save the file to a location that's easy to find (for example, c:\scripts).

5. Run the script by using the following syntax:

   ```powershell
   & "<file path>\RunCmdletOnMultipleTenants.ps1" "<file path>\inputfile.csv"
   ```

   Here's an example:

   ```powershell
   & "c:\scripts\RunCmdletOnMultipleTenants.ps1" "c:\scripts\inputfile.csv"
   ```

6. Each tenant will be logged on to, and the script will be run.

## RunCmdletOnMultipleTenants.ps1

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to modify the `Connect-IPPSSession` line in the script to match your environment. For example, Office 365 Germany requires a different _ConnectionUri_ value than the current value in a script. For details, see Connect to [Exchange Online Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

```powershell
# This script runs Windows PowerShell cmdlets on multiple tenants.
#
# Usage: RunCmdletOnMultipleTenants.ps1 inputfile.csv
#
# .csv input file sample:
#
# UserName,Cmdlet
# admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com,Get-AcceptedDomain | FT Name
# admin@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com,Get-AcceptedDomain | FT Name

# Get the .csv file name as an argument to this script.
$FilePath = $args[0]

# Import the UserName and Cmdlet values from the .csv file.
$CompanyList = Import-CSV $FilePath

# Load the EXO V2 module
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement

# Loop through each entry from the .csv file.
ForEach ($Company in $CompanyList) {
  
# Get the current entry's UserName.
$UserName = $Company.UserName

# Get the current entry's Cmdlet.
$Cmdlet = $Company.Cmdlet

# Connect to EOP PowerShell by using the current entry's UserName. Prompt for the password.
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName $UserName -ConnectionUri https://ps.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/

# Here's where the script to be run on the tenant goes.
# In this example, the cmdlet in the .csv file runs.
Invoke-Expression $Cmdlet

# End the current PowerShell session.
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false
}
```
