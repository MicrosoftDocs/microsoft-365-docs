# Understanding overrides within the email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Within the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 *[email entity page](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-email-entity-page)*, there's a wealth of useful information about an email, including if applicable the **overrides** which affected that message, and potentially the location that the message was delivered or moved to post delivery.

This article is all about helping you **understand the different overrides**, how they're triggered, and helpful information for diagnosing when the effect of an override was unexpected, such as an email being blocked when no threats were found.

## Overrides details table

The following table lists all overrides, a description of what that override means and some starting points for troubleshooting. Not all overrides are honored, depending on the circumstance. For example an email that contains malware is automatically blocked regardless if an end user set the sender as a "safe sender". To learn more about how overrides are applied see [this table](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-policies-and-protections-are-combined).
