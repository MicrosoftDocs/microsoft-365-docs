# Deploy and configure the report message add-in to users.

The Report message and report phishing add-in for Outlook makes it easy to report phishing to Microsoft and its affiliates for analysis, along with easy triage for admins in the [submissions portal](https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user). 

Depending on whether you are licensed for Defender for Office 365, you'll also get added functionality such as alerting & automated investigation and response (AIR), which will remove the burden from your security operations staff. This guide will walk you through configuring the add-in deployment as recommended by the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 team.

## Choose between which add-in to deploy

- The Report Phishing add-in provides the option to report only phishing messages
- The Report Message add-in provides the option to report junk, not junk (false positive), and phishing messages


## What you'll need

-	Exchange Online Protection (some features require Defender for Office 365 Plan 2)
-	Sufficient permissions (Global admin for add-in deployment, security admin for customization)
- 5-10 minutes to perform the steps below

## Deploy the add-in for users

1.	**Login** to the Microsoft 365 admin center.  https://admin.microsoft.com.
1.	On the left nav, press **Show All** then expand **Settings** and select **Integrated Apps**.
1.	On the page that loads, press **Get Apps**.
1.	In the page that appears, in the top right Search box, enter **Report Message** or **Report Phishing**, and then select **Search**.
1.	Press **Get it now** on your chosen app within the search results (publisher is **Microsoft Corporation**).
1.	On the flyout that appears, select who to deploy the add-in to. If testing you may wish to use a specific group, otherwise configure it for the **entire organization** – when you've made a selection press **Next**.
1.	Review the permissions, information and capabilities then press **Next**.
1.	Press **Finish deployment** (it can take 12-24 hours for the add-in to appear automatically in Outlook clients).

## Configure the add-in for users
1.	**Login** to the Microsoft Security portal at https://security.microsoft.com.
2.	On the left nav, under **Email & collaboration**, select **Policies & rules**.
3.	Select **Threat policies**.
4.	Select **User reported message settings** underneath the **Others** heading.
5.	Ensure **Microsoft Outlook Report Message button** is toggled to **On**.
6.	Under **Send the reported messages to** choose **Microsoft** (Recommended).
7.	Ensure **Let users choose if they want to report** is unchecked and **Always report the message** is selected.
8.	Press **Save**.

## Optional steps – configure notifications

1.	On the configuration page from the earlier steps, underneath the **User reporting experience**, configure the before and after reporting pop-ups title and body if desired. The end users will see the before reporting pop up if **Ask me before reporting** is also enabled.
2.	If you wish for notifications to come from an internal organizational mailbox, select **Specify Office 365 email address to use as sender** and search for a valid mailbox in your organization to send the notifications from.
3.	Press **Customize notifications** to set up the text sent to reporting users after admin reviews a reported message using Mark & Notify, configure the **Phishing**, **Junk** & **No threats** found options.
4.	On the **Footer** tab, select the global footer to be sent for notifications, along with your organization's logo if appropriate.
