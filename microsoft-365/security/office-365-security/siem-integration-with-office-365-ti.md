# SIEM integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

If your organization is using a security information and event management (SIEM) server, you can integrate Microsoft Defender for Office 365 with your SIEM server. You can set up this integration by using the [Office 365 Activity Management API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference).

SIEM integration enables you to view information, such as malware or phish detected by Microsoft Defender for Office 365, in your SIEM server reports.

- To see an example of SIEM integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365, see [Tech Community blog: Improve the Effectiveness of your SOC with Defender for Office 365 and the O365 Management API](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/improve-the-effectiveness-of-your-soc-with-office-365-atp-and/ba-p/1525185).
- To learn more about the Office 365 Management APIs, see [Office 365 Management APIs overview](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-apis-overview).

## How SIEM integration works

The Office 365 Activity Management API retrieves information about user, admin, system, and policy actions and events from your organization's Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory activity logs. If your organization has Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2, or Office 365 E5, you can use the [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 schema](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#office-365-advanced-threat-protection-and-threat-investigation-and-response-schema).

Recently, events from automated investigation and response capabilities in [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-and-plan-2) were added to the Office 365 Management Activity API. In addition to including data about core investigation details such as ID, name and status, the API also contains high-level information about investigation actions and entities.

The SIEM server or other similar system polls the **audit.general** workload to access detection events. To learn more, see [Get started with Office 365 Management APIs](/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis).
