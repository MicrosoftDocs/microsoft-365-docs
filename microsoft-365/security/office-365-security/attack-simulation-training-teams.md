# Microsoft Teams in Attack simulation training

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft 365 Defender, admins can now use Attack simulation training to deliver simulated phishing messages in Microsoft Teams. For more information about attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

The addition of Teams in Attack simulation training affects the following features:

- [Simulations](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md)
- [Payloads](attack-simulation-training-payloads.md)
- [Simulation automations](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md)

[Payload automations](attack-simulation-training-payload-automations.md), [end-user notifications](attack-simulation-training-end-user-notifications.md), [login pages](attack-simulation-training-login-pages.md), and [landing pages](attack-simulation-training-landing-pages.md) aren't affected by Teams in Attack simulation training.

## Teams simulation configuration

In addition to having user reporting for Teams messages turned on as described in [User reported message settings in Microsoft Teams](submissions-teams.md), you also need to configure the Teams accounts that can be used as sources for simulation messages in Attack simulation training.

To configure the accounts, do the following steps:

1. Identify or create a user who's a member of the [Global Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator), [Security Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator), or [Attack Simulation Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#attack-simulation-administrator) roles in Azure Active Directory. You need to know the password.
2. Using the account from Step 1, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com> and go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Settings** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Settings** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=setting>.
3. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manager user accounts** in the **Teams simulation configuration** section.
4. In the **Teams simulation configuration** flyout that opens, select **Generate token**. Read the information in the confirmation dialog, and then select **I agree**.
5. Back on the **Settings** tab, select **Manager user accounts** in the **Teams simulation configuration** section again to reopen the **Teams simulation configuration** flyout. The user account that you were logged in as now appears in the **User accounts available for Teams phishing** section.

To remove a user from the list, select the round check box that appears next to the user's **Display name** without clicking anywhere else in the row. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete** action that appears, and then select **Delete** in the confirmation dialog.

Or, to prevent the account from being used in Teams simulations but keep the linked simulations history for the account, you can block the account from signing in as described [here](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/remove-former-employee-step-1).

## Changes in simulations for Microsoft Teams

Teams introduces the following changes to viewing and creating simulations as described in [Simulate a phishing attack with Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md):

- On the **Simulations** tab at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>, the **Platform** column shows the value **Teams** for simulations that use Teams messages.

- If you select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Launch a simulation** on the **Simulations** tab to create a simulation, the first page of the new simulation wizard is **Select delivery platform** where you can select **Microsoft Teams**. Selecting **Microsoft Teams** introduces the following changes to the rest of the new simulation wizard:

  - On the **[Select technique](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique)** page, the **Malware Attachment** and **Link in Attachment** social engineering techniques aren't available.

  - On the **[Name simulation](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#name-and-describe-the-simulation)** page, a **Select sender's Microsoft Teams account** section and **Select user account** link are present. Select **Select user account** to find and select the account to use as the source for the Teams message.

  - On the **[Select payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page)**, no payloads are listed by default because there are no built-in payloads for Teams. You need to create a payload for the combination of Teams and the social engineering technique that you selected.

    The differences in creating payloads for Teams are described in the [Changes in payloads for Microsoft Teams](#changes-in-payloads-for-microsoft-teams) section in this article.

  - On the **[Target users](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#target-users)** page, the following settings are different for Teams:
    - As noted on the page, guest users in Teams are excluded from simulations.
    - If you select **Include only specific users and groups**, **City** isn't an available filter in the **Filter users by category** section.

Other settings related to simulations are the same for Teams messages as described in the existing content for email messages.

## Changes in payloads for Microsoft Teams

Whether you create a payload on the **Payloads** page of the **Content library** tab or on the **[Select payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page)** page in the new simulation wizard, Teams introduces the following changes to viewing and creating payloads as described in [Payloads in Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-payloads.md):

- On the **Global payloads** and **Tenant payloads** tabs on **Payloads** page of the **Content library** tab at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>, the **Platform** column shows the value **Teams** for payloads that use Teams messages.

  If you select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** to filter the list of existing payloads, a **Platform** section is available where you can select **Email** and **Teams**.

  As previously described, there are no built-in payloads for Teams, so if you filter by **Status** \> **Teams** on the **Global payloads** tab, the list will be empty.

- If you select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Create a payload** on the **Tenant payload** tab to create a payload, the first page of the new payload wizard is **Select type** where you can select **Teams**. Selecting **Teams** introduces the following changes to the rest of the new payload wizard:

  - On the **[Select technique](attack-simulation-training-payloads.md#create-payloads)** page, the **Malware Attachment** and **Link in Attachment** social engineering techniques aren't available for Teams.

  - The **Configure payload** page has the following changes for Teams:
    - **Sender details** section: The only available setting for Teams is **Chat topic** where you enter a tile for the Teams message.
    - The last section isn't named **Email message**, but it functions the same way for Teams messages as it does for email messages:
      - There's an **Import Teams message** button to import an existing plain text message file to use as a starting point.
      - The **Dynamic tag** and **Phishing link** controls are available on the **Text** tab, and **Code** tab is available as with email messages.

Other settings related to payloads are the same for Teams messages as described in the existing content for email messages.

## Changes in simulation automations for Microsoft Teams

Teams introduces the following changes to viewing and creating simulation automations as described in [Simulation automations for Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md):

- On the **Simulation automations** page of the **Automations** tab at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=automations>, the following columns are also available:
  - **Type**: Currently, this value is always **Social engineering**.
  - **Platform**: Shows the value **Teams** for payload automations that use Teams messages or **Email** for payload automations that use email messages.

- If you select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Create automation** on the **Simulation automations** page to create a simulation automation, the first page of the new simulation automation wizard is **Select delivery platform** where you can select **Teams**. Selecting **Teams** introduces the following changes to the rest of the new simulation automation wizard:

  - On the [Automation name](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md#name-and-describe-the-simulation-automation) page, the following settings are available for Teams in the **Select method for choosing sender accounts** section:
    - **Manually select**: This value is selected by default. In the **Select sender's Microsoft Teams account** section, select the **Select user account** to find and select the account to use as the source for the Teams message.
    - **Randomize**: Randomly select from the available accounts to use as the source for the Teams message.

  - On the **[Select social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md#select-one-or-more-social-engineering-techniques)** page, the **Malware Attachment** and **Link in Attachment** social engineering techniques aren't available for Teams.

  - On the **[Select payloads and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md#select-payloads-and-login-pages)** page, no payloads are listed by default because there are no built-in payloads for Teams. You might need to create a payload for the combination of Teams and the social engineering techniques that you selected.

    The differences in creating payloads for Teams are described in the [Changes in payloads for Microsoft Teams](#changes-in-payloads-for-microsoft-teams) section in this article.

  - On the **[Target users](attack-simulation-training-simulation-automations.md#target-users)** page, the following settings are different for Teams:
    - As noted on the page, simulation automations that use Teams can target a maximum of 1000 users.
    - if you select **Include only specific users and groups**, **City** isn't an available filter in the **Filter users by category** section.

Other settings related to simulation automations are the same for Teams messages as described in the existing content for email messages.
