# Simulate a phishing attack with Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, simulations are benign cyberattacks that you run in your organization. These simulations test your security policies and practices, as well as train your employees to increase their awareness and decrease their susceptibility to attacks. This article walks you through creating a simulated phishing attack using Attack simulation training.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To launch a simulated phishing attack, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulations** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Simulations** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>.

2. On the **Simulations** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Launch a simulation** to start the new simulation wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-launch.png" alt-text="The Launch a simulation button on the Simulations tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-launch.png":::

   The following sections describe the steps and configuration options to create a simulation.

   > [!NOTE]
   > At any point after you name the simulation during the new simulation wizard, you can select **Save and close** to save your progress and continue later. The incomplete simulation has the **Status** value **Draft**. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the simulation and then clicking the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit simulation** action that appears.

## Select a social engineering technique

On the **Select technique** page, select an available social engineering technique, which was curated from the [MITRE ATT&CK® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/). Different payloads are available for different techniques. The following social engineering techniques are available:

- **Credential Harvest**: Attempts to collect credentials by taking users to a well-known looking website with input boxes to submit a username and password.
- **Malware Attachment**: Adds a malicious attachment to a message. When the user opens the attachment, arbitrary code is run that helps the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Link in Attachment**: A type of credential harvest hybrid. An attacker inserts a URL into an email attachment. The URL within the attachment follows the same technique as credential harvest.
- **Link to Malware**: Runs some arbitrary code from a file hosted on a well-known file sharing service. The message sent to the user contains a link to this malicious file. Opening the file helps the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Drive-by URL**: The malicious URL in the message takes the user to a familiar-looking website that silently runs and/or installs code on the user's device.
- **OAuth Consent Grant**: The malicious URL asks users to grant permissions to data for a malicious Azure Application.

If you select the **View details** link in the description, a details flyout opens that describes the technique and the simulation steps that result from the technique.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png" alt-text="The Details flyout for the credential harvest technique on the Select technique page" lightbox="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png":::

When you're finished on the **Select technique** page, select **Next**.

## Name and describe the simulation

On the **Name simulation** page, configure the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the simulation.
- **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the simulation.

When you're finished on the **Name simulation** page, select **Next**.

## Select a payload and login page

On the **Select payload and login page** page, you need to select an existing payload or create a new payload.

For the **Credential Harvest** or **Link in Attachment** social engineering techniques, you can also view the login page that's used in the payload, select a different login page to use, or create a new login page to use.

### Select a payload

The following details are shown for each payload:

- **Payload name**
- **Source**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Global**. For custom payloads, the value is **Tenant**.
