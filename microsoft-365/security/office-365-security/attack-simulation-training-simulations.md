# Simulate a phishing attack with Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, simulations allow you run benign cyberattack simulations in your organization. These simulations test your security policies and practices, as well as train your employees to increase their awareness and decrease their susceptibility to attacks. This article walks you through creating a simulated phishing attack using Attack simulation training.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To launch a simulated phishing attack, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulations** tab.

   To go directly to the **Simulations** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>.

2. On the **Simulations** tab, select ![Launch a simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Launch a simulation**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-launch.png" alt-text="The Launch a simulation button on the Simulations tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-launch.png":::

3. The simulation creation wizard opens. The rest of this article describes the pages and the settings they contain.

> [!NOTE]
> At any point during the simulation creation wizard, you can click **Save and close** to save your progress and continue configuring the simulation later. The incomplete simulation has the **Status** value **Draft** on the **Simulations** tab. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the simulation and clicking ![Edit simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** simulation.

## Select a social engineering technique

On the **Select technique** page, select an available social engineering technique, which was curated from the [MITRE ATT&CK® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/). Different payloads are available for different techniques. The following social engineering techniques are available:

- **Credential harvest**: Attempts to collect credentials by taking users to a well-known looking website with input boxes to submit a username and password.
- **Malware attachment**: Adds a malicious attachment to a message. When the user opens the attachment, arbitrary code is run that will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Link in attachment**: A type of credential harvest hybrid. An attacker inserts a URL into an email attachment. The URL within the attachment follows the same technique as credential harvest.
- **Link to malware**: Runs some arbitrary code from a file hosted on a well-known file sharing service. The message sent to the user will contain a link to this malicious file. Opening the file will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Drive-by URL**: The malicious URL in the message takes the user to a familiar-looking website that silently runs and/or installs code on the user's device.
- **OAuth Consent Grant**: The malicious URL asks users to grant permissions to data for a malicious Azure Application.

If you click the **View details** link in the description, a details flyout opens that describes the technique and the simulation steps that result from the technique.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png" alt-text="The Details flyout for the credential harvest technique on the Select technique page" lightbox="../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png":::

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Name and describe the simulation

On the **Name simulation** page, configure the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the simulation.
- **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the simulation.

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Select a payload and login page

On the **Select payload and login** page, you need to select an existing payload from the list, or create a new payload.

You can also view the login page that's used in the payload, select a different login page to use, or create a new login page to use.

### Payload

The following details are shown for each payload:

- **Payload name**
- **Language**: The language of the payload content. Microsoft's payload catalog (global) provides payloads in 10+ languages which can also be filtered.
- **Click rate**: How many people have clicked on this payload.
- **Predicted compromise rate**: Historical data across Microsoft 365 that predicts the percentage of people who will be compromised by this payload (users compromised / total number of users who receive the payload).
- **Simulations launched** counts the number of times this payload was used in other simulations.

In the ![Search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png) **Search** box, you can type part of the payload name and press Enter to filter the results.

If you click **Filter**, the following filters are available:

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heightened protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.
