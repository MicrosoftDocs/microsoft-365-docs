# Manage quarantined messages and files as a user

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages. For more information, see [Quarantine in EOP](quarantine-about.md).

As an ordinary user (not an admin), the **default** capabilities that are available to you as a recipient of a quarantined message are described in the following table:

|Quarantine reason|View|Release|Delete|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Anti-spam policies**||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulk|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spam|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High confidence spam|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phishing|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High confidence phishing||||
|**Anti-phishing policies**||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoof intelligence protection in EOP|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impersonated user protection in Defender for Office 365|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impersonated domain protection in Defender for Office 365|✔|✔|✔|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mailbox intelligence impersonation protection in Defender for Office 365|✔|✔|✔|
|**Anti-malware policies**||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email messages with attachments that are quarantined as malware.||||
|**Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365**||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe Attachments policies that quarantine email messages with malicious attachments as malware.||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams that quarantines malicious files as malware.||||
|**Mail flow rules (transport rules)**||||
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mail flow rules that quarantine email messages (directly, not by marking them as spam).||||

In [supported protection features](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features), _quarantine policies_ define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined. Default quarantine policies enforce the historical capabilities for messages as described in the previous table. Admins can create and apply custom quarantine policies that define less restrictive or more restrictive capabilities for users. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

You view and manage your quarantined messages in the Microsoft Defender portal or (if an admin has set this up) quarantine notifications from quarantine policies.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Microsoft Defender portal, go to <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

- Admins can configure how long messages are kept in quarantine before they're permanently deleted in anti-spam policies. Messages that have expired from quarantine are unrecoverable. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

- By default, messages that were quarantined for high confidence phishing, malware, or by mail flow rules are only available to admins, and aren't visible to users. For more information, see [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md).

## Manage quarantined messages in EOP

### View your quarantined messages

> [!NOTE]
> Your ability to view quarantined messages is controlled by the quarantine policy that applies to the reason why the message was quarantined (which might be the default quarantine policy as described in [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md)).

In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Review** \> **Quarantine** \> **Email** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Email** tab on the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine?viewid=Email>.

On the **Email** tab, you can decrease the vertical spacing in the list by clicking :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-standard-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change list spacing to compact or normal** and then selecting :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-compact-icon.png" border="false"::: **Compact list**.

You can sort the entries by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. The default values are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):

- **Time received**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Subject**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Sender**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Quarantine reason**<sup>\*</sup> (see the possible values in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** description.)
- **Release status**<sup>\*</sup> (see the possible values in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** description.)
- **Policy type**<sup>\*</sup> (see the possible values in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** description.)
- **Expires**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Recipient**<sup>\*</sup>
- **Message ID**
- **Policy name**
- **Message size**
- **Mail direction**
- **Recipient tag**

To filter the entries, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter**. The following filters are available in the **Filters** flyout that opens:

- **Message ID**: The globally unique identifier of the message.
- **Sender address**
- **Recipient address**
- **Subject**
- **Time received**:
  - **Last 24 hours**
  - **Last 7 days**
  - **Last 14 days**
  - **Last 30 days** (default)
  - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
- **Expires**: Filter messages by when they expire from quarantine:
  - **Today**
  - **Next 2 days**
  - **Next 7 days**
  - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
- **Recipient tag**
- **Quarantine reason**:
  - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)
  - **Bulk**
  - **Spam**
  - **Data loss prevention**
  - **Malware**: Anti-malware policies in EOP or Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365. The **Policy Type** value indicates which feature was used.
  - **Phishing**: The spam filter verdict was **Phishing** or anti-phishing protection quarantined the message ([spoof settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) or [impersonation protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)).
  - **High confidence phishing**
  - **Admin action - File type block**: Messages blocked as malware by the common attachments filter in anti-malware policies. For more information, see [Anti-malware policies](anti-malware-protection-about.md#anti-malware-policies).
- **Recipient**: **All users** or **Only me**. End users can only manage quarantined messages sent to them.
- **Release status**: Any of the following values:
  - **Needs review**
  - **Approved**
  - **Denied**
  - **Release requested**
  - **Released**
- **Policy Type**: Filter messages by policy type:
  - **Anti-malware policy**
  - **Safe Attachments policy**
  - **Anti-phishing policy**
  - **Anti-spam policy**
  - **Transport rule** (mail flow rule)

  The **Policy type** and **Quarantine reason** values are interrelated. For example, **Bulk** is always associated with an **Anti-spam policy**, never with an **Anti-malware policy**.

When you're finished on the **Filters** flyout, select **Apply**. To clear the filters, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear filters**.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific messages. Wildcards aren't supported. You can search by the following values:

- Sender email address
- Subject. Use the entire subject of the message. The search isn't case-sensitive.

After you've entered the search criteria, press the enter ENTER key to filter the results.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Search** box searches for quarantined items in the current view, not all quarantined items. To search all quarantined items, use **Filter** and the resulting **Filters** flyout.

After you find a specific quarantined message, select the message to view details about it and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).

> [!TIP]
> On mobile devices, the previously described controls are available under :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More**.

#### Release quarantined email

> [!NOTE]
> Your ability to release quarantined messages is controlled by the quarantine policy for the protection feature that quarantined the message (which might be a default quarantine policy as described in [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md)).
>
> A quarantine policy can allow you to release a message or request the release of a message, but both options aren't available for the same message. A quarantine policy can also prevent you from releasing or requesting the release of quarantined messages.

This action isn't available for email messages that have already been released (the **Release status** value is **Released**).

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to release it (deliver it to your mailbox):

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-check-mark-icon.png" border="false"::: **Release**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-check-mark-icon.png" border="false"::: **Release email**.

In the **Release message to your Inbox** flyout that opens, select **Report message as having no threats** as appropriate, and then select **Release message**.

When you're finished on the **Release message to your Inbox** flyout, select **Release message**.

In the **Messages released to your Inbox** flyout that opens, select **Done**.

Back on the **Email** tab, the **Release status** value of the message is **Released**.

The message is delivered to your Inbox (or some other folder, depending on any [Inbox rules](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59) in your mailbox).

#### Request the release of quarantined email

> [!NOTE]
> Your ability to request the release of quarantined messages is controlled by the quarantine policy for the protection feature that quarantined the message.
>
> A quarantine policy can allow you to release a message or request the release of a message, but both options aren't available for the same message. A quarantine policy can also prevent you from releasing or requesting the release of quarantined messages.

This action isn't available for email messages where you already requested release (the **Release status** value is **Released requested**).

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to request its release:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Request release**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Request release**.

In the **Request release** flyout that opens, review the information, select **Request release**. In the **Release requested** flyout that opens, select **Done**.

Back on the **Quarantine page**, the **Release status** value of the message is **Release requested**. An admin will review your request and approve it or deny it.

#### Delete email from quarantine

When you delete an email message from quarantine, the message is removed and isn't sent to the original recipients.

If you don't release or remove a message, it's automatically deleted from quarantine after the date shown in the **Expires** column.

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to remove it:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete messages**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete from quarantine**.

In the **Delete (n) messages from quarantine** flyout that opens, use one of the following methods to delete the message:

- Select **Permanently delete the message from quarantine** and then select **Delete**: The message is permanently deleted and isn't recoverable.
- Select **Delete** only: The message is deleted, but is potentially recoverable.

After you select **Delete** on the **Delete (n) messages from quarantine** flyout, you return to the **Email** tab where the message is no longer listed.

> [!TIP]
> Admins can find out who deleted a quarantined message by searching the admin audit log. For instructions, see [Find who deleted a quarantined message](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#find-who-deleted-a-quarantined-message).

#### Preview email from quarantine

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to preview it:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-preview-message-icon.png" border="false"::: **Preview message**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-preview-message-icon.png" border="false"::: **Preview message**.

In the flyout that opens, choose one of the following tabs:
  - **Source**: Shows the HTML version of the message body with all links disabled.
  - **Plain text**: Shows the message body in plain text.

#### View email message headers

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to view the message headers:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-message-headers-icon.png" border="false"::: **View message headers**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-message-headers-icon.png" border="false"::: **View message headers**.

In the **Message header** flyout that opens, the message header (all header fields) is shown.

Use :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy message header** to copy the message header to the clipboard.

Select the **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer** link to analyze the header fields and values in depth. Paste the message header into the **Insert the message header you would like to analyze** section (CTRL+V or right-click and choose **Paste**), and then select **Analyze headers**.

#### Block email senders from quarantine

The Block senders action adds the message sender to the Blocked Senders list in your mailbox. For more information about blocking senders, see [Block a mail sender](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4).

After you select the message, use either of the following methods to add the message sender to the Blocked Senders list in your mailbox:

- **On the Email tab**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-block-sender-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block sender**.
- **In the details flyout of the selected message**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options** \> :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-block-sender-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block sender**.

In the **Block sender** flyout that opens, review the information about the sender, and then select **Block**.

> [!TIP]
> The organization can still receive mail from the blocked sender. Messages from the sender are delivered to user Junk Email folders or to quarantine. To delete messages from the sender upon arrival, an admin can use [mail flow rules](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules) (also known as transport rules) to **Block the message**.

#### Take action on multiple quarantined email messages

When you select multiple quarantined messages on the **Email** tab by selecting the check boxes next to the first column, the following bulk actions are available on the **Email** tab (depending on the **Release status** values of the messages that you selected):

- [Release quarantined email](#release-quarantined-email)
- [Request the release of quarantined email](#request-the-release-of-quarantined-email)
- [Delete email from quarantine](#delete-email-from-quarantine)

## Manage quarantined messages in Microsoft Teams

When a potentially malicious chat message is detected in Microsoft Teams, zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) removes the message and quarantines it. Users can now view and manage these quarantined Teams messages in the Microsoft Defender portal. Quarantine notifications aren't supported for quarantined Teams messages.

### View your quarantined messages in Microsoft Teams

In the Microsoft Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to **Email & collaboration** > **Review** > **Quarantine** > **Teams messages** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Teams messages** tab on the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine?viewid=Teams>.

You can sort the entries by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. The default columns are:

- **Teams message text**: Contains the subject for the teams message.
- **Date quarantined**: Showed when the message was quarantined.
- **Status**: Shows whether the message is already reviewed and released or needs review.
- **Sender**: The person who sent the message that was quarantined.
- **Quarantine reason**: Available options are **High confidence phish** and **Malware**.
- **Expires**: Indicates the time after which the message is removed from quarantine. By default, this value is 30 days.

To filter the entries, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter**. The following filters are available in the **Filters** flyout that opens:

- **Sender address**
- **Time received**:
  - **Last 24 hours**
  - **Last 7 days**
  - **Last 14 days**
  - **Last 30 days** (default)
  - **Custom**: Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
- **Expires in**:
  - **Custom** (default): Enter a **Start time** and **End time** (date).
  - **Today**
  - **Next 2 days**
  - **Next 7 days**
- **Quarantine reason**: Available values are **Malware** and **High confidence phishing**.
- **Status**: Select **Needs review** and **Released**.

When you're finished in the **Filters** flyout, select **Apply**. To clear the filters, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear filters**.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific Teams messages. Wildcards aren't supported.

After you find a specific quarantined Teams message, select the message to view details about it and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).

#### View quarantined message details in Microsoft Teams

On the **Teams messages** tab, select the quarantined message by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box.
