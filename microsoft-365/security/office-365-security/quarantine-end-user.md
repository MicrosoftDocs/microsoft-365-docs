# Find and release quarantined messages as a user in EOP

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or unwanted messages. For more information, see [Quarantine in EOP](quarantine-about.md).

As an ordinary user (not an admin), the **default** capabilities that are available to you as a recipient of a quarantined message are described in the following table:

|Quarantine reason|View|Release|Delete|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Anti-spam policies**||||
|Bulk|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|Spam|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|

|**Anti-malware policies**||||
|Email messages with attachments that are quarantined as malware.||||
|**Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365**||||
|Safe Attachments policies that quarantine email messages with malicious attachments as malware.||||
|Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams that quarantines malicious files as malware.||||
|**Mail flow rules (transport rules)**||||
|Mail flow rules that quarantine email messages.||||

_Quarantine policies_ define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined in [supported features](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features). Default quarantine policies enforce the historical capabilities as described in the previous table. Admins can create and apply custom quarantine policies that define less restrictive or more restrictive capabilities for users in supported features. For more information, see [Quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md).

You view and manage your quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or (if an admin has set this up) quarantine notifications from quarantine policies.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Quarantine** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>.

- Admins can configure how long messages are kept in quarantine before they're permanently deleted in anti-spam policies. Messages that have expired from quarantine are unrecoverable. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

- By default, messages that were quarantined for high confidence phishing, malware, or by mail flow rules are only available to admins, and aren't visible to users. For more information, see [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP](manage-quarantined-messages-and-files.md).

## View your quarantined messages

> [!NOTE]

     - **High confidence phishing**
   - **Release status**: Any of the following values:
     - **Needs review**
     - **Approved**
     - **Denied**
     - **Release requested**

   When you're finished, click **Apply**. To clear the filters, click ![Clear filters icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png) **Clear filters**.

4. Use **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific messages. Wildcards aren't supported. You can search by the following values:
   - Message ID
   - Sender email address
   - Recipient email address
   - Subject. Use the entire subject of the message. The search is not case-sensitive.
   - Policy name. Use the entire policy name. The search is not case-sensitive.

   After you've entered the search criteria, press ENTER to filter the results.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Search** box on the main **Quarantine** page will search only quarantined items in the current view, not the entire quarantine. To search all quarantined items, use **Filter** and the resulting **Filters** flyout.

After you find a specific quarantined message, select the message to view details about it, and to take action on it (for example, view, release, download, or delete the message).
