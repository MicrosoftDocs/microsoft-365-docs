# Quarantine policies

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

Quarantine policies (formerly known as _quarantine tags_) in Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 allow admins to control what users are able to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined. This feature is available in all Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes.

Traditionally, users have been allowed or denied levels of interactivity for quarantine messages based on why the message was quarantined. For example, users can view and release messages that were quarantined by anti-spam filtering as spam or bulk, but they can't view or release messages that were quarantined as high confidence phishing or malware.

For [supported protection features](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features), quarantine policies specify what users are allowed to do to their own messages (messages where they're a recipient) in quarantine and in _quarantine notifications_. [Quarantine notifications](quarantine-quarantine-notifications.md) are the replacement for end-user spam notifications. These notifications are now controlled by quarantine policies, and contain information about quarantined messages for all supported protection features (not just anti-spam policy and anti-phishing policy verdicts).

Default quarantine policies that enforce the historical user capabilities are automatically assigned to actions in the supported protection features that quarantine messages. Or, you can create custom quarantine policies and assign them to the supported protection features to allow or prevent users from performing specific actions on those types of quarantined messages.

The individual quarantine policy permissions are combined into the following preset permission groups:

- No access
- Limited access
- Full access

The individual quarantine policy permissions that are contained in the preset permission groups are described in the following table:

|Permission|No access|Limited access|Full access|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Block sender** (_PermissionToBlockSender_)||![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|**Delete** (_PermissionToDelete_)||![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|**Preview** (_PermissionToPreview_)||![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|**Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** (_PermissionToRelease_)<sup>\*</sup>|||![Check mark.](../../media/checkmark.png)|
|**Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** (_PermissionToRequestRelease_)||![Check mark](../../media/checkmark.png)||

<sup>\*</sup>The **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** permission is not honored in anti-malware policies or for the high confidence phishing verdict in anti-spam policies. Users cannot release their own malware or high confidence phishing messages from quarantine. At best, you can use the **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** permission.

The default quarantine policies, their associated permission groups, and whether quarantine notifications are enabled is described in the following table:

|Default quarantine policy|Permission group used|Quarantine notifications enabled?|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|AdminOnlyAccessPolicy|No access|No|
|DefaultFullAccessPolicy|Full access|No|
|NotificationEnabledPolicy<sup>\*</sup>|Full access|Yes|

If you don't like the default permissions in the preset permission groups, or if you want to enable quarantine notifications, create and use custom quarantine policies. For more information about what each permission does, see the [Quarantine policy permission details](#quarantine-policy-permission-details) section later in this article.

You create and assign quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes; standalone EOP PowerShell in EOP organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

> [!NOTE]
> How long quarantined messages are held in quarantine before they expire is controlled by the **Retain spam in quarantine for this many days** (_QuarantineRetentionPeriod_) in anti-spam policies. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).
>
> If you change the quarantine policy that's assigned to a supported protection feature, the change affects messages that are quarantined _after_ you make the change. Messages that were previously quarantined by that protection feature are not affected by the settings of the new quarantine policy assignment.

## Full access permissions and quarantine notifications

<sup>\*</sup> The quarantine policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy is not present in all environments. You'll have the NotificationEnabledPolicy quarantine policy if your organization meets both of the following requirements:

- Your organization existed before the quarantine policy feature was turned on (late July/early August 2021).
- You had one or more [anti-spam policies](anti-spam-policies-configure.md) (the default anti-spam policy or custom anti-spam policies) where the **Enable end-user spam notifications** setting was turned on.

As described earlier, quarantine notifications in quarantine policies replace end-user spam notifications that you used to turn on or turn off in anti-spam policies. The built-in quarantine policy named DefaultFullAccessPolicy duplicates the historical _permissions_ for quarantined messages, but _quarantine notifications_ are not turned on in the quarantine policy. And, because you can't modify the built-in policy, you can't turn on quarantine notifications in DefaultFullAccessPolicy.

To provide the permissions of DefaultFullAccessPolicy but with quarantine notifications turned on, we created the policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy to use in place of DefaultFullAccessPolicy for those organizations that needed it (organizations where end-user spam notifications were turned on).

For new organizations or older organizations that never had end-user spam notifications enabled in anti-spam policies, you won't have the quarantine policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy. The way for you to turn on quarantine notifications is to create and use custom quarantine policies where quarantine notifications are turned on.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- To view, create, modify, or remove quarantine policies, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management**, **Security Administrator**, or **Quarantine Administrator** roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md).

## Step 1: Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies>.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-quarantine-policy-page.png" alt-text="Quarantine policy page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/mdo-quarantine-policy-page.png":::

2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, click ![Add custom policy icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Add custom policy**.

3. The **New policy** wizard opens. On the **Policy name** page, enter a brief but unique name in the **Policy name** box. You'll need to identify and select the quarantine policy by name in upcoming steps. When you're finished, click **Next**.

4. On the **Recipient message access** page, select one of the following values:
   - **Limited access**: The individual permissions that are included in this permission group are described earlier in this article.
   - **Set specific access (Advanced)**: Use this value to specify custom permissions. Configure the following settings that appear:
     - **Select release action preference**: Select one of the following values:
       - Blank: This is the default value.
       - **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine**
       - **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine**
     - **Select additional actions recipients can take on quarantined messages**: Select some, all, or none of the following values:
       - **Delete**
       - **Preview**
       - **Block sender**

   These permissions and their effect on quarantined messages and in quarantine notifications are described in the [Quarantine policy permission details](#quarantine-policy-permission-details) section later in this article.

   When you're finished, click **Next**.

5. On the **End-user spam notification** page, select **Enable** to enable quarantine notifications (formerly known as end-user spam notifications). When you're finished, click **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > As explained earlier, the built-in policies (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy or DefaultFullAccessPolicy) do not have quarantined notifications turned on, and you can't modify the policies.

6. On the **Review policy** page, review your settings. You can select **Edit** in each section to modify the settings within the section. Or you can click **Back** or select the specific page in the wizard.

   When you're finished, click **Submit**.

7. On the confirmation page that appears, click **Done**.

Now you're ready to assign the quarantine policy to a quarantine feature as described in the [Step 2](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) section.

### Create quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to create quarantine policies, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell or Exchange Online Protection PowerShell and use the **New-QuarantinePolicy** cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't use the _ESNEnabled_ parameter and the value `$true`, then quarantine notifications are turned off.

#### Use the EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue parameter

To create a quarantine policy using the _EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue_ parameter, use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-QuarantinePolicy -Name "<UniqueName>" -EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue <0 to 236> [-EsnEnabled $true]
```

The _EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue_ parameter uses a decimal value that's converted from a binary value. The binary value corresponds to the available end-user quarantine permissions in a specific order. For each permission, the value 1 equals True and the value 0 equals False.

The required order and values for each individual permission are described in the following table:

|Permission|Decimal value|Binary value|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|PermissionToViewHeader<sup>\*</sup>|128|10000000|
|PermissionToDownload<sup>\*\*</sup>|64|01000000|
|PermissionToAllowSender<sup>\*\*</sup>|32|00100000|
|PermissionToBlockSender|16|00010000|
|PermissionToRequestRelease<sup>\*\*\*</sup>|8|00001000|
|PermissionToRelease<sup>\*\*\*</sup>|4|00000100|
|PermissionToPreview|2|00000010|
|PermissionToDelete|1|00000001|

<sup>\*</sup> The value 0 doesn't hide the **View message header** button in the details of the quarantined message (the button is always available).

<sup>\*\*</sup> This setting is not used (the value 0 or 1 does nothing).

<sup>\*\*\*</sup> Don't set both of these values to 1. Set one to 1 and the other to 0, or set both to 0.

For Limited access permissions, the required values are:

|Permission|Limited access|
|---|:--:|
|PermissionToViewHeader|0|
|PermissionToDownload|0|
|PermissionToAllowSender|0|
|PermissionToBlockSender|1|
|PermissionToRequestRelease|1|
|PermissionToRelease|0|
|PermissionToPreview|1|
|PermissionToDelete|1|
|Binary value|00011011|
|Decimal value to use|27|

This example creates a new quarantine policy named LimitedAccess with quarantine notifications turned on that assigns the Limited access permissions as described in the previous table.

```powershell
New-QuarantinePolicy -Name LimitedAccess -EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue 27 -EsnEnabled $true
```

For custom permissions, use the previous table to get the binary value that corresponds to the permissions you want. Convert the binary value to a decimal value and use the decimal value for the _EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue_ parameter. Don't use the binary value for the parameter value.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-QuarantinePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-quarantinepolicy).

## Step 2: Assign a quarantine policy to supported features

In _supported_ protection features that quarantine email messages, you can assign a quarantine policy to the available quarantine actions. Features that quarantine messages and the availability of quarantine policies are described in the following table:

|Feature|Quarantine policies supported?|Default quarantine policies used|
|---|:---:|---|
|[Anti-spam policies](anti-spam-policies-configure.md): <ul><li>**Spam** (_SpamAction_)</li><li>**High confidence spam** (_HighConfidenceSpamAction_)</li><li>**Phishing** (_PhishSpamAction_)</li><li>**High confidence phishing** (_HighConfidencePhishAction_)</li><li>**Bulk** (_BulkSpamAction_)</li></ul>|Yes|<ul><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>AdminOnlyAccessPolicy (No access)</li><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li></ul>|
|Anti-phishing policies: <ul><li>[Spoof intelligence protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) (_AuthenticationFailAction_)</li><li>[Impersonation protection in Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365):<ul><li>**If message is detected as an impersonated user** (_TargetedUserProtectionAction_)</li><li>**If message is detected as an impersonated domain** (_TargetedDomainProtectionAction_)</li><li>**If mailbox intelligence detects and impersonated user** (_MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction_)</li></ul></li></ul>|Yes|<ul><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>Impersonation protection:<ul><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li><li>DefaultFullAccessPolicy<sup>\*</sup> (Full access)</li></ul></li></ul>|
|[Anti-malware policies](configure-anti-malware-policies.md): All detected messages are always quarantined.|Yes|AdminOnlyAccessPolicy (No access)|
|[Safe Attachments protection](safe-attachments-about.md): <ul><li>Email messages with attachments that are quarantined as malware by Safe Attachments policies (_Enable_ and _Action_)</li><li>Files quarantined as malware by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md)</li></ul>|<ul><li>Yes</li><li>No</li></ul>|<ul><li>AdminOnlyAccessPolicy (No access)</li><li>n/a</li></ul>|
|[Mail flow rules](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules) (also known as transport rules) with the action: **Deliver the message to the hosted quarantine** (_Quarantine_).|No|n/a|

<sup>\*</sup> As [previously described in this article](#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications), your organization might use NotificationEnabledPolicy instead of DefaultFullAccessPolicy. The only difference between these two quarantine policies is quarantine notifications are turned on in NotificationEnabledPolicy and turned off in DefaultFullAccessPolicy.

The default quarantine policies, preset permission groups, and permissions are described at [the beginning of this article](#quarantine-policies) and [later in this article](#preset-permissions-groups).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're happy with the default end-user permissions and quarantine notifications that are provided (or not provided) by the default quarantine policies, you don't need to do anything. If you want to add or remove end-user capabilities (the available buttons) for user quarantined messages, or enable quarantine notifications and add or remove the same capabilities in quarantine notifications, you can assign a different quarantine policy to the quarantine action.

## Assign quarantine policies in supported policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

> [!NOTE]
> Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware (anti-malware policies) or high confidence phishing (anti-spam policies), regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. At best, admins can configure the quarantine policy so users can request the release of their quarantined malware or high confidence phishing messages.

### Anti-spam policies

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-spam** in the **Policies** section.

   Or, to go directly to the **Ant-spam policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antispam>.

2. On the **Anti-spam policies** page, do one of the following steps:
   - Find and select an existing **inbound** anti-spam policy.
   - Create a new **inbound** anti-spam policy.

3. Do one of the following steps:
   - **Edit existing**: Select the policy by clicking on the name of the policy. In the policy details flyout, go to the **Actions** section and then click **Edit actions**.
   - **Create new**: In the new policy wizard, get to the **Actions** page.

4. On the **Actions** page, every verdict that has the **Quarantine message** action will also have the **Select quarantine policy** box for you to select a corresponding quarantine policy.

   **Note**: When you create a new policy, a blank **Select quarantine policy** value indicates the default quarantine policy for that verdict is used. When you later edit the policy, the blank values are replaced by the actual default quarantine policy names as described in the previous table.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-spam-policies.png" alt-text="The Quarantine policy selections in an anti-spam policy" lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-spam-policies.png":::

Full instructions for creating and modifying anti-spam policies are described in [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

#### Anti-spam policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to assign quarantine policies in anti-spam policies, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell or Exchange Online Protection PowerShell and use the following syntax:

```powershell
<New-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-SpamAction Quarantine] [-SpamQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-HighConfidenceSpamAction Quarantine] [-HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-PhishSpamAction Quarantine] [-PhishQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-BulkSpamAction Quarantine] [-BulkQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] ...
```

**Notes**:

- The default value for the _PhishSpamAction_ and _HighConfidencePhishAction_ parameters is Quarantine, so you don't need to use those parameters when you create new spam filter policies in PowerShell. For the _SpamAction_, _HighConfidenceSpamAction_, and _BulkSpamAction_ parameters in new or existing anti-spam policies, the quarantine policy is effective only if the value is Quarantine.

  To see the important parameter values in existing anti-spam policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,*SpamAction,HighConfidencePhishAction,*QuarantineTag
  ```

  For information about the default action values and the recommended action values for Standard and Strict, see [EOP anti-spam policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#eop-anti-spam-policy-settings).

- When you create new anti-spam policies, a spam filtering verdict without a corresponding quarantine policy parameter means the [default quarantine policy](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) for that verdict is used.

  You need to replace a default quarantine policy with a custom quarantine policy only if you want to change the default end-user capabilities on quarantined messages for that particular spam filtering verdict.

- A new anti-spam policy in PowerShell requires a spam filter policy (settings) using the **New-HostedContentFilterPolicy** cmdlet and an exclusive spam filter rule (recipient filters) using the **New-HostedContentFilterRule** cmdlet. For instructions, see [Use PowerShell to create anti-spam policies](anti-spam-policies-configure.md#use-powershell-to-create-anti-spam-policies).

This example creates a new spam filter policy named Research Department with the following settings:

- The action for all spam filtering verdicts is set to Quarantine.
- The custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions replaces any default quarantine policies that don't already assign **No access** permissions by default.

```powershell
New-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Name "Research Department" -SpamAction Quarantine -SpamQuarantineTag NoAccess -HighConfidenceSpamAction Quarantine -HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag NoAction -PhishSpamAction Quarantine -PhishQuarantineTag NoAction -BulkSpamAction Quarantine -BulkQuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-HostedContentFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-hostedcontentfilterpolicy).

This example modifies the existing spam filter policy named Human Resources. The action for the spam quarantine verdict is set to Quarantine, and the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess is assigned.

```powershell
Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -SpamAction Quarantine -SpamQuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-hostedcontentfilterpolicy).

### Anti-phishing policies

Spoof intelligence is available in EOP and Defender for Office 365. User impersonation protection, domain impersonation protection, and mailbox intelligence are available only in Defender for Office 365. For more information, see [Anti-phishing policies in Microsoft 365](anti-phishing-policies-about.md).

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-phishing** in the **Policies** section.

   Or, to go directly to the **Ant-spam policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antiphishing>.

2. On the **Anti-phishing** page, do one of the following steps:
   - Find and select an existing anti-phishing policy.
   - Create a new anti-phishing policy.

3. Do one of the following steps:
   - **Edit existing**: Select the policy by clicking on the name of the policy. In the policy details flyout, go to the **Protection settings** section and then click **Edit protection settings**.
   - **Create new**: In the new policy wizard, get to the **Actions** page.

4. On the **Protection settings** page, verify that the following settings are turned on and configured as required:
   - **Enabled users to protect**: Specify users.
   - **Enabled domains to protect**: Select **Include domains I own** and/or **Include custom domains** and specify the domains.
   - **Enable mailbox intelligence**
   - **Enable intelligence for impersonation protection**
   - **Enable spoof intelligence**

5. Do one of the following steps:
   - **Edit existing**: In the policy details flyout, go to the **Actions** section and then click **Edit actions**.
   - **Create new**: In the new policy wizard, get to the **Actions** page.

6. On the **Actions** page, every verdict that has the **Quarantine the message** action will also have the **Apply quarantine policy** box for you to select a corresponding quarantine policy.

   **Note**: When you create a new policy, a blank **Apply quarantine policy** value indicates the default quarantine policy for that action is used. When you later edit the policy, the blank values are replaced by the actual default quarantine policy names as described in the previous table.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-phishing-policies.png" alt-text="The Quarantine policy selections in an anti-phishing policy" lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-phishing-policies.png":::

Full instructions for creating and modifying anti-phishing policies are available in the following topics:

- [Configure anti-phishing policies in EOP](anti-phishing-policies-eop-configure.md)
- [Configure anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md)

#### Anti-phishing policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to assign quarantine policies in anti-phishing policies, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell or Exchange Online Protection PowerShell and use the following syntax:

```powershell
<New-AntiPhishPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-AntiPhishPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-EnableSpoofIntelligence $true] [-AuthenticationFailAction Quarantine] [-SpoofQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableMailboxIntelligence $true] [-EnableMailboxIntelligenceProtection $true] [-MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction Quarantine] [-MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableOrganizationDomainsProtection $true] [-EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true] [-TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine] [-TargetedDomainQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableTargetedUserProtection $true] [-TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine] [-TargetedUserQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] ...
```

**Notes**:

- The _Enable\*_ parameters are required to turn on the specific protection features. The default value for the _EnableMailboxIntelligence_ and _EnableSpoofIntelligence_ parameters is $true, so you don't need to use these parameters when you create new anti-phish policies in PowerShell. All other _Enable\*_ parameters need to have the value $true so you can set the value Quarantine in the corresponding _\*Action_ parameters to then assign a quarantine policy. None of the _*\Action_ parameters have the default value Quarantine.

  To see the important parameter values in existing anti-phish policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-AntiPhishPolicy | Format-List Name,Enable*Intelligence,Enable*Protection,*Action,*QuarantineTag
  ```

  For information about the default action values and the recommended action values for Standard and Strict, see [EOP anti-phishing policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#eop-anti-phishing-policy-settings) and [Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

- When you create anti-phishing policies, an anti-phishing action without a corresponding quarantine policy parameter means the [default quarantine policy](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) for that verdict is used.

  You need to replace a default quarantine policy with a custom quarantine policy only if you want to change the default end-user capabilities on quarantined messages for that particular verdict.

- A new anti-phishing policy in PowerShell requires an anti-phish policy (settings) using the **New-AntiPhishPolicy** cmdlet and an exclusive anti-phish rule (recipient filters) using the **New-AntiPhishRule** cmdlet. For instructions, see the following topics:
  - [Use PowerShell to configure anti-phishing policies in EOP](anti-phishing-policies-eop-configure.md#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-anti-phishing-policies)
  - [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-anti-phishing-policies)

This example creates a new anti-phish policy named Research Department with the following settings:

- The action for all spam filtering verdicts is set to Quarantine.
- The custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions replaces any default quarantine policies that don't already assign **No access** permissions by default.

```powershell
New-AntiPhishPolicy -Name "Research Department" -AuthenticationFailAction Quarantine -SpoofQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableMailboxIntelligenceProtection $true -MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction Quarantine -MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableOrganizationDomainsProtection $true -EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true -TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedDomainQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableTargetedUserProtection $true -TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedUserQuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-AntiPhishPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-antiphishpolicy).

This example modifies the existing anti-phish policy named Human Resources. The action for messages detected by user impersonation and domain impersonation is set to Quarantine, and the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess is assigned.

```powershell
Set-AntiPhishPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true -TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedDomainQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableTargetedUserProtection $true -TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedUserQuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-AntiPhishPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-antiphishpolicy).

### Anti-malware policies

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-malware** in the **Policies** section.

   Or, to go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2>.

2. On the **Anti-malware** page, do one of the following steps:
   - Find and select an existing anti-malware policy.
   - Create a new anti-malware policy.

3. Do one of the following steps:
   - **Edit existing**: Select the policy by clicking on the name of the policy. In the policy details flyout, go to the **Protection settings** section and then click **Edit protection settings**.
   - **Create new**: In the new policy wizard, get to the **Actions** page.

4. On the **Protection settings** page, select a quarantine policy in the **Quarantine policy** box.

   **Note**: When you create a new policy, a blank **Quarantine policy** value indicates the default quarantine policy for that is used. When you later edit the policy, the blank value is replaced by the actual default quarantine policy name as described in the previous table.

#### Anti-malware policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to assign quarantine policies in anti-malware policies, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell or Exchange Online Protection PowerShell and use the following syntax:

```powershell
<New-AntiMalwarePolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-AntiMalwarePolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-QuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>]
```

**Notes**:

- When you create new anti-malware policies without using the QuarantineTag parameter when you create a new anti-malware policy, the default quarantine policy for malware detections is used (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy).

  You need to replace the default quarantine policy with a custom quarantine policy only if you want to change the default end-user capabilities on messages that are quarantined as malware.

  To see the important parameter values in existing anti-phish policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-MalwareFilterPolicy | Format-Table Name,QuarantineTag
  ```

- A new anti-malware policy in PowerShell requires a malware filter policy (settings) using the **New-MalwareFilterPolicy** cmdlet and an exclusive malware filter rule (recipient filters) using the **New-MalwareFilterRule** cmdlet. For instructions, see [Use Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell to configure anti-malware policies](configure-anti-malware-policies.md#use-exchange-online-powershell-or-standalone-eop-powershell-to-configure-anti-malware-policies).

This example creates a malware filter policy named Research Department that uses the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions to the quarantined messages.

```powershell
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Name "Research Department" -QuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-malwarefilterpolicy).

This example modifies the existing malware filter policy named Human Resources by assigning the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions to the quarantined messages.

```powershell
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -QuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-malwarefilterpolicy).

### Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Safe Attachments** in the **Policies** section.

   Or, to go directly to the **Safe Attachments** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2>.

2. On the **Safe Attachments** page, do one of the following steps:
   - Find and select an existing Safe Attachments policy.
   - Create a new Safe Attachments policy.

3. Do one of the following steps:
   - **Edit existing**: Select the policy by clicking on the name of the policy. In the policy details flyout, go to the **Settings** section and then click **Edit settings**.
   - **Create new**: In the new policy wizard, get to the **Settings** page.

4. On the **Settings** page, do the following steps:
   1. **Safe Attachments unknown malware response**: Select **Block**, **Replace**, or **Dynamic Delivery**.
   2. Select a quarantine policy in the **Quarantine policy** box.

   **Note**: When you create a new policy, a blank **Quarantine policy** value indicates the default quarantine policy is used. When you later edit the policy, the blank value is replaced by the actual default quarantine policy name as described in the previous table.

Full instructions for creating and modifying Safe Attachments policies are described in [Set up Safe Attachments policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](set-up-safe-attachments-policies.md).

#### Safe Attachments policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to assign quarantine policies in Safe Attachments policies, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell or Exchange Online Protection PowerShell and use the following syntax:

```powershell
<New-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> -Enable $true -Action <Block | Replace | DynamicDelivery> [-QuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>]
```

**Notes**:

- The _Action_ parameter values Block, Replace, or DynamicDelivery can result in quarantined messages (the value Allow does not quarantine messages). The value of the _Action_ parameter in meaningful only when the value of the _Enable_ parameter is `$true`.

- When you create new Safe Attachments policies without using the QuarantineTag parameter, the default quarantine policy for Safe Attachments detections in email is used (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy).

  You need to replace the default quarantine policy with a custom quarantine policy only if you want to change the default end-user capabilities on email messages that are quarantined by Safe Attachments policies.

  To see the important parameter values, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-SafeAttachmentPolicy | Format-List Name,Enable,Action,QuarantineTag
  ```

- A new Safe Attachments policy in PowerShell requires a safe attachment policy (settings) using the **New-SafeAttachmentPolicy** cmdlet and an exclusive safe attachment rule (recipient filters) using the **New-SafeAttachmentRule** cmdlet. For instructions, see [Use Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell to configure Safe Attachments policies](set-up-safe-attachments-policies.md#use-exchange-online-powershell-or-standalone-eop-powershell-to-configure-safe-attachments-policies).

This example creates a safe attachment policy named Research Department that blocks detected messages and uses the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions to the quarantined messages.

```powershell
New-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Name "Research Department" -Enable $true -Action Block -QuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-malwarefilterpolicy).

This example modifies the existing safe attachment policy named Human Resources by assigning the custom quarantine policy named NoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions.

```powershell
Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -QuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-malwarefilterpolicy).

## Configure global quarantine notification settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The global settings for quarantine policies allow you to customize the quarantine notifications that are sent to recipients of quarantined messages if quarantine notifications are turned on in the quarantine policy. For more information about these notifications, see [Quarantine notifications](quarantine-quarantine-notifications.md).

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies>.

2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select **Global settings**.

3. In the **Quarantine notification settings** flyout that opens, configure the following settings:

   > [!NOTE]
   > We don't allow the same display name, subject, or disclaimer text for different languages. You need to provide a different display name, subject, and disclaimer text for each language that you select.
   >
   > The same sender address is used for all languages. Although you can select a different sender email address for each language, the last sender you specify is used for all languages.

   - Customize quarantine notifications based on the recipient's language:

     - The **Display name** of the sender that's used in quarantine notifications as shown in the following screenshot.

       :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-display-name.png" alt-text="A customized sender display name in a quarantine notification." lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-display-name.png":::

     - The **Subject** field of the quarantine notification messages.

     - The **Disclaimer** text that's added to the bottom of quarantine notifications. The localized text, **A disclaimer from your organization:** is always included first, followed by the text you specify as show in the following screenshot:

       :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-disclaimer.png" alt-text="A custom disclaimer at the bottom of a quarantine notification." lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-disclaimer.png":::

     - The language identifier for the **Display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer** values. Quarantine notifications are already localized based on the recipient's language settings. The **Display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer** values are used in quarantine notifications that apply to the recipient's language.

       Select the language in the **Choose language** box _before_ you enter values in the **Display name**, **Subject** and **Disclaimer** boxes. When you change the value in the **Choose language** box, the values in the **Display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer** boxes are emptied.

     Follow these steps to customize quarantine notifications based on the recipient's language:

     1. Select the language from the **Choose language** box. The default value is **Default**, which means the default language for the Microsoft 365 organization. For more information, see [How to set language and region settings for Microsoft 365](/office365/troubleshoot/access-management/set-language-and-region).
     2. Enter values for **Display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer**. The values must be unique for each language. If you try to reuse a **Display name**, **Subject**, or **Disclaimer** value for multiple languages, you'll get an error when you click **Save**.
     3. Use **Specify sender address** to select an existing recipient to use as the sender of quarantine notifications. If you've already specified a sender for a different language, the sender you specify will overwrite your previous selection (the same sender email address is used for all languages).
     4. Click the **Add** button.
     5. Repeat the previous steps to create a maximum of three customized quarantine notifications based on the recipient's language. An unlabeled box shows the languages that you've configured:

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-selected-languages.png" alt-text="The selected languages in the global quarantine notification settings of quarantine policies." lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-selected-languages.png":::

   - **Use my company logo**: Select this option to replace the default Microsoft logo that's used at the top of quarantine notifications. Before you do this step, you need to follow the instructions in [Customize the Microsoft 365 theme for your organization](../../admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme.md) to upload your custom logo. This option is not supported if your organization has a custom logo pointing to a URL instead of an uploaded image file.

     The following screenshot shows a custom logo in a quarantine notification:

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-logo.png" alt-text="A custom logo in a quarantine notification" lightbox="../../media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-logo.png":::

   - **Send end-user spam notification every (days)**: Select the frequency for quarantine notifications. The default value is 3 days, but you can select 1 to 15 days.

4. When you're finished, click **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-quarantine-policy-quarantine-notification-settings.png" alt-text="Quarantine notification settings flyout in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/mdo-quarantine-policy-quarantine-notification-settings.png":::

   The main difference is: you can't rename an existing policy.

5. When you're finished modifying the policy, go to the **Summary** page and click **Submit**.

### Modify quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to modify a custom quarantine policy, replace \<QuarantinePolicyName\> with the name of the quarantine policy, and use the following syntax:

```powershell
Set-QuarantinePolicy -Identity "<QuarantinePolicyName>" [Settings]
```

The available settings are the same as described for creating quarantine policies earlier in this article.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-QuarantinePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-quarantinepolicy).

## Remove quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

**Notes**:

- You can't remove the built-in quarantine policies named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy or DefaultFullAccessPolicy. You can remove the built-in policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy ([if you have it](#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications)) and custom quarantine policies.
- Before you remove a quarantine policy, verify that it's not being used. For example, run the following command in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-spam policies","----------------------";Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,*QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-phishing policies","----------------------";Get-AntiPhishPolicy | Format-List Name,*QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-malware policies","----------------------";Get-MalwareFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Safe Attachments policies","---------------------------";Get-SafeAttachmentPolicy | Format-List Name,QuarantineTag
  ```

  If the quarantine policy is being used, [replace the assigned quarantine policy](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) before you remove it.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies>.

2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select the custom quarantine policy that you want to remove by clicking on the name.

3. After you select the policy, click the ![Delete policy icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png) **Delete policy** icon that appears.

4. Click **Remove policy** in the confirmation dialog that appears.

### Remove quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to remove a custom quarantine policy, replace \<QuarantinePolicyName\> with the name of the quarantine policy, and run the following command:

```powershell
Remove-QuarantinePolicy -Identity "<QuarantinePolicyName>"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-QuarantinePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-quarantinepolicy).

## System alerts for quarantine release requests

By default, the default alert policy named **User requested to release a quarantined message** automatically generates an informational alert and sends notification to Organization Management (global administrator) whenever a user requests the release of a quarantined message:

Admins can customize the email notification recipients or create a custom alert policy for more options.

For more information about alert policies, see [Alert policies in Microsoft 365](../../compliance/alert-policies.md).

## Quarantine policy permission details

The following sections describe the effects of preset permission groups and individual permissions in the details of quarantined messages and in quarantine notifications.

### Preset permissions groups

The individual permissions that are included in preset permission groups are listed in the table at the beginning of this article.

#### No access

If the quarantine policy assigns the **No access** permissions (admin only access), users will not able to see those messages that are quarantined:

- **Quarantined message details**: No messages will show in the end-user view.
