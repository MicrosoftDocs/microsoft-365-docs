      - question: |
          I'm a reseller and I need to manage my customer tenants. How does this work?
        answer: |
          If you're a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you've signed up to be a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), you can request _delegated administration_ capabilities in your customer's Microsoft 365 organization. For more information, see the following articles:

          - [Cloud Solution Provider program](/partner-center/csp-overview)
          - [Obtain permissions to manage a customer's service or subscription](/partner-center/customers-revoke-admin-privileges).

      - question: |
          I'm a customer, not a reseller. How can I set up delegated administrator for my subtenants?
        answer: |
          Delegated administration is only available for resellers and partners. However, there's a sample PowerShell script to help you apply policies to your subtenants (companies). For more information, see [Sample script for applying EOP settings to multiple tenants](/exchange/standalone-eop/sample-script-standalone-eop-settings-to-multiple-tenants).

      - question: |
          Can I prevent my subtenant admin from modifying my policy?
        answer: |
          No. Microsoft 365 doesn't currently have this capability.

      - question: |
          Can I get consolidated reporting across all of my subtenants?
        answer: |
          Consolidated reporting across the companies you manage isn't available in Microsoft 365 admin center reports. However, you can get reports by using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview).
