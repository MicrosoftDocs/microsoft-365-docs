# View email security reports in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In all Microsoft 365 organizations, a variety of reports are available to help you see how email security features are protecting your organization. If you have the [necessary permissions](#what-permissions-are-needed-to-view-these-reports), you can view and download these reports as described in this article.

The reports are available in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com> on the **Email & collaboration reports** page at **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. Or, to go directly to the **Email & collaboration reports** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>.

Summary information for each report is available on the page. Identify the report you want to view, and then select **View details** for that report.

The rest of this article describes the reports that are exclusive to Defender for Office 365.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Some of the reports on the **Email & collaboration reports** page are exclusive to Microsoft Defender for Office 365. For information about these reports, see [View Defender for Office 365 reports in the Microsoft Defender portal](reports-defender-for-office-365.md).

> This report is now available in the EAC. For more information, see [Auto forwarded messages report in the new EAC](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-auto-forwarded-messages-report).

## Mailflow status report

The **Mailflow status report** is a smart report that shows information about incoming and outgoing email, spam detections, malware, email identified as "good", and information about email allowed or blocked on the edge. This is the only report that contains edge protection information. The report shows how much email is blocked before entering the service for examination by Exchange Online Protection (EOP) or Defender for Microsoft 365.

> [!TIP]
> If a message is sent to five recipients, we count it as five different messages, not one message.

On the **Email & collaboration reports** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>, find **Mailflow status summary**, and then select **View details**. Or, to go directly to the report, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reports/mailflowStatusReport>.

### Mailflow view for the Mailflow status report

The **Mailflow** tab shows you how Microsoft's email threat protection features filter incoming and outgoing email in your organization. This view uses a horizontal flow diagram (known as a _Sankey_ diagram) to provide details on the total email count, and how threat protection features affect this count.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mail-flow-status-report-mailflow-view.png" alt-text="The Mailflow view in the Mailflow status report." lightbox="../../media/mail-flow-status-report-mailflow-view.png":::

The aggregate view and details table view allow for 90 days of filtering.

The information in the diagram is color-coded by **EOP** and **Defender for Office 365** technologies.

The diagram is organized into the following horizontal bands:

- **Total email** band: This value is always shown first.
- **Edge block** and **Processed** band:
  - **Edge block**: Messages that were filtered at the edge and identified as Edge Protection.
  - **Processed**: Messages that were handled by the filtering stack.
- Outcomes band:
  - **Data loss prevention block**
  - **Rule Block**: Messages that were quarantined by Exchange mail flow rules (transport rules).
  - **Malware block**: Messages that were identified as malware.<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Phishing block**: Messages that were identified as phishing.<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Spam block**: Messages that were identified as spam.<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Impersonation block**: Messages that were detected as user impersonation or domain impersonation in Defender for Office 365.<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Detonation block**: Messages that were detected during file or URL detonation by Safe Attachments policies or Safe Links policies in Defender for Office 365.<sup>\*</sup>
  - **ZAP removed**: Messages that were removed by zero-hour auto purge (ZAP).<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Delivered**: Messages that were delivered to users due to an allow.<sup>\*</sup>

If you hover over a horizontal band in the diagram, you see the number of related messages.

<sup>\*</sup> If you select this element, the diagram expands to show further details. For a description of each element in the expanded nodes, see [Detection technologies](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#detection-technologies).

## Threat protection status report

The **Threat protection status** report is available in both EOP and Defender for Office 365. However, the reports contain different data. For example, EOP customers can view information about malware detected in email, but not information about malicious files detected by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md).

The report provides the count of email messages with malicious content. For example:

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2021, phishing detections in email were updated to include **message attachments** that contain phishing URLs. This change might shift some of the detection volume out of the **View data by Email \> Malware** view and into the **View data by Email \> Phish** view. In other words, message attachments with phishing URLs that were traditionally identified as malware now might be identified as phishing instead.

In the **View data by Email \> Phish** and **Chart breakdown by Detection Technology** view, the following information is shown in the chart:

- **Advanced filter**: Phishing signals based on machine learning.
- **Campaign**<sup>\*</sup>: Messages identified as part of a [campaign](campaigns.md).

- **Impersonation domain**<sup>\*</sup>: Impersonation of sender domains that you own or specified for protection in [anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).
- **Impersonation user**<sup>\*</sup>: Impersonation of protected senders that you specified in [anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) or learned through mailbox intelligence.
- **Mailbox intelligence impersonation**<sup>\*</sup>: Impersonation detections from mailbox intelligence in [anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).
- **Mixed analysis detection**: Multiple filters contributed to the message verdict.
- **Spoof DMARC**: The message failed [DMARC authentication](email-authentication-dmarc-configure.md).
- **Spoof external domain**: Sender email address spoofing using a domain that's external to your organization.
- **Spoof intra-org**: Sender email address spoofing using a domain that's internal to your organization.
- **URL detonation**<sup>\*</sup>: [Safe Links](safe-links-about.md) detected a malicious URL in the message during detonation analysis.
- **URL detonation reputation**<sup>\*</sup>: URLs previously detected by [Safe Links](safe-links-about.md) detonations in other Microsoft 365 organizations.

> To download on-demand reports, you need to be a member of the **Organization management** role in Exchange Online or the **Global Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID.

After you request an on-demand report as described in the previous section, you check the status of the report and eventually download the report on the **Reports for download** page in the Defender portal.

In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> select **Reports for download**. Or, to go directly to the **Reports for download** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/ReportsForDownload>.

On the **Reports for download** page, the following information is shown for each available report:

- **Start date**
- **Name**
- **Report type**
- **Last sent**
- **Status**:
  - **Pending**: The report is still being created, and it isn't available to download yet.
  - **Complete - Ready for download**: Report generation is complete, and the report is available to download.
  - **Complete - No results found**: Report generation is complete, but the report contains no data, so you can't download it.

To download the report, select the check box next in the start date of the report, and then select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Download report** action that appears.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box to find an existing report.

In the **Save as** dialog that opens, you see the default name of the .csv file and the download location (the local Downloads folder by default), but you can change those values and then select **Save** to download the report.
