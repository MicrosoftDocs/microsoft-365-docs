# Payloads in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, a _payload_ is the phishing email message and links or attachment content that's presented to users in simulations. Attack simulation training offers a robust built-in payload catalog for the available social engineering techniques. However, you might want to create custom payloads that will work better for your organization.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the available payloads, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> and then select **Payloads**. To go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads**, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

**Payloads** in the **Content library** tab has three tabs:

- **Global payloads**: Contains the built-in, non-modifiable payloads.
- **Tenant payloads**: Contains the custom payloads that you've created.
- **MDO recommendations**: Payloads that are recommended by Defender for Office 365 as having considerable impact when used by attackers. This list is refreshed monthly.

The following information is shown for each payload on the **Global payloads** and **Tenant payloads** tabs<sup>\*</sup>:

- **Payload name**
- **Type**: Currently, this value is always **Social engineering**.
- **Language**: If the payload contains multiple translations, the first two languages are shown directly. To see the remaining languages, hover over the numeric icon (for example, **+10**).
- **Source**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Global**. For custom payloads, the value is **Tenant**.
- **Simulations launched**: The number of launched simulations that use the payload.
- **Predicted compromised rate (%)**: Historical data across Microsoft 365 that predicts the percentage of people who will be compromised by this payload (users compromised / total number of users who receive the payload). For more information, see [Predicted compromise rate](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#predicted-compromise-rate).
- **Created by**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Microsoft**. For custom payloads, the value is the UPN of the user who created the payload.
- **Last modified**
- **Technique**: One of the available [social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):
  - **Credential Harvest**
  - **Malware Attachment**
  - **Link in Attachment**
  - **Link to Malware**
  - **Drive-by URL**
  - **OAuth Consent Grant**
- **Status**: Values are:
  - **Ready**
  - **Draft**: Available only on the **Tenant payloads** tab.
  - **Archive**: Archived payloads are visible only when **Show archived payloads** is toggled on ![Toggle on icon.](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png).
- **⋮** (**Actions** control): Take action on the payload. The available actions depend on the **Status** value of the payload as described in the procedure sections. This control always appears at the end of the payload row.

Click a column header to sort by that column. To add or remove columns, click ![Customize columns icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png) **Customize columns**. By default, the only available column that's not selected is **Platform**.

<sup>\*</sup> To see all columns, you'll likely need to do one or more of the following steps:

- Horizontally scroll in your web browser.
- Narrow the width of appropriate columns.
- Remove columns from the view.
- Zoom out in your web browser.

To find a payload in the list, type part of the payload name in the ![Search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png) **Search** box and then press the ENTER key.

Click ![Filter icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png) to filter the payloads by one or of the following values:

- **Complexity**: Calculated based on the number of indicators in the payload that indicate a possible attack (spelling errors, urgency, etc.). More indicators are easier to identify as an attack and indicate lower complexity. The available values are: **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.

- **Language**: The available values are: **English**, **Spanish**, **German**, **Japanese**, **French**, **Portuguese**, **Dutch**, **Italian**, **Swedish**, **Chinese (Simplified)**, **Norwegian Bokmål**, **Polish**, **Russian**, **Finnish**, **Korean**, **Turkish**, **Hungarian**, **Hebrew**, **Thai**, **Arabic**, **Vietnamese**, **Slovak**, **Greek**, **Indonesian**, **Romanian**, **Slovenian**, **Croatian**, **Catalan**, or **Other**.

- **Add tag(s)**

- **Filter by theme**: The available values are: **Account activation**, **Account verification**, **Billing**, **Clean up mail**, **Document received**, **Expense**, **Fax**, **Finance report**, **Incoming messages**, **Invoice**, **Items received**, **Login alert**, **Mail received**, **Password**, **Payment**, **Payroll**, **Personalized offer**, **Quarantine**, **Remote work**, **Review message**, **Security update**, **Service suspended**, **Signature required**, **Upgrade mailbox storage Verify mailbox**, **Voicemail**, and **Other**.

- **Filter by brand**: The available values are: **American Express**, **Capital One**, **DHL**, **DocuSign**, **Dropbox**, **Facebook**, **First American**, **Microsoft**, **Netflix**, **Scotiabank**, **SendGrid**, **Stewart Title**, **Tesco**, **Wells Fargo**, **Syrinx Cloud**, and **Other**.

- **Filter by industry**: The available values are: **Banking**, **Business services**, **Consumer services**, **Education**, **Energy**, **Construction**, **Consulting**, **Financial services**, **Government**, **Hospitality**, **Insurance**, **Legal**, **Courier services**, **IT**, **Healthcare**, **Manufacturing**, **Retail**, **Telecom**, **Real estate**, and **Other**.

- **Current event**: The available values are **Yes** or **No**.

- **Controversial**: The available values are **Yes** or **No**.

When you're finished configuring filters, click **Apply**, **Cancel**, or ![Clear filters icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png) **Clear filters**.

When you select a payload by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name, a details flyout appears with the following information:

- **Overview** tab: View the payload as users will see it. Payload properties are also visible:
  - **Payload description**
  - **From name**
  - **From email**
  - **Email subject**
  - **Source**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Global**. For custom payloads, the value is **Tenant**.
  - **Theme**
  - **Brand**
  - **Industry**
  - **Controversial**
  - **Predicted compromise rate**
  - **Current event**
  - **Tags**

- **Simulations launched** tab:
  - **Simulation name**
  - **Click rate**
  - **Compromised rate**
  - **Action**: Clicking the **View details** link takes you to the details of the simulation.

To see payloads that have been archived (the **Status** value is **Archive**), use the **Show archived payloads** toggle on the **Tenant payloads** tab.

## Create payloads

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heightened protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> **Payloads** \> **Tenant payloads** tab. To go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads** and the **Tenant payloads** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

   On the **Tenant payloads** tab, click ![Create a payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create a payload** to start the new payload wizard.
