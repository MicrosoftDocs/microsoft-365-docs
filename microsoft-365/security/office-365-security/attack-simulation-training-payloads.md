# Payloads in Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, a _payload_ is the phishing email message and links or attachment content that's are presented to users in simulations. Attack simulation training offers a robust built-in payload catalog for the available social engineering techniques. However, you might want to create custom payloads that will work better for your organization.

To see the available payloads, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulation content library** tab \> and then select **Payloads**. To go directly to the **Simulation content library** tab where you can select **Payloads**, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulationcontentlibrary>.

**Payloads** in the **Simulation content library** tab has two tabs:

- **Global payloads**: Contains the built-in, non-modifiable payloads.
- **Tenant payloads**: Contains the custom payloads that you've created.

The following information is shown for each payload:

- **Payload name**
- **Type**: Currently, this value is always **Social engineerings**.
- **Language**: If the payload contains multiple translations, the first two languages are shown directly. To see the remaining languages, hover over the numeric icon (for example, **+10**).
- **Source**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Global**. For custom payloads, the value is **Tenant**.
- **Simulations launched**: The number of launched simulations that use the payload.
- **Compromised rate (%)**: For built-in payloads, this value is the predicted average compromise rate for Attack simulation training simulations that use the same type of payload across all other Microsoft 365 organizations.
- **Created by**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Microsoft**. For custom payloads, the value is the UPN of the user who created the payload.
- **Last modified**
- **Technique**: One of the available [social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):
  - **Credential harvest**
  - **Malware attachment**
  - **Link in attachment**
  - **Link to malware**
  - **Drive-by URL**
  - **OAuth consent grant**
- **Status**: The value is **Ready** or **Draft**. On the **Global payloads** tab, the value is always **Ready**.

To find a payload in the list, use the ![Search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png) **Search** box to find the name of the payload.

Click ![Filter icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png) to filter the payloads by one or of the following values:

- **Complexity**: **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.
- **Language**
- **Add tag(s)**
- **Theme**
- **Brand**
- **Industry**
- **Current event**: **Yes** or **No**.
- **Controversial**: **Yes** or **No**.

To remove one or more columns that are displayed, click ![Customize columns icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png) **Customize columns**. By default, the only column that's not shown is **Platform**, and that value is currently always **Email**.

When you select a payload from the list, a details flyout appears with the following information:

- **Overview** tab: View the payload as users will see it. Payload properties are also visible:
  - **Payload description**
  - **From name**
  - **From email**
  - **Email subject**
  - **Source**: For built-in payloads, the value is **Global**. For custom payloads, the value is **Tenant**.
  - **Theme**
  - **Brand**
  - **Industry**
  - **Controversial**
  - **Current event**
  - **Tags**

- **Simulations launched** tab:
  - **Simulation name**
  - **Click rate**
  - **Compromised rate**
  - **Action**

## Create payloads

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heightened protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulation content library** tab \> **Payloads** \> **Tenant payloads** tab. To go directly to the **Simulation content library** tab where you can select **Payloads** and the **Tenant payloads** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulationcontentlibrary>.

   Click ![Create a payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create a payload** on the **Tenant payloads** tab in **Payloads** to start the create payload wizard.

   ![Create a payload on the Tenant payloads tab in Payloads in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.](../../media/attack-sim-training-payload-create.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > ![Create a payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create a payload** is also available on the **Select payload and login page** step of the simulation creation wizard. For more information, see [Create a simulation: Select a payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page).
   >
   > At any point during the creation wizard, you can click **Save and close** to save your progress and continue configuring the payload later. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the notification on the **Tenant payloads** tab in **Payloads**, and then clicking ![Edit payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit payload**. The partially-completed payload will have the **Status** value **Draft**.

2. On the **Select type** page, the only value that you can currently select is **Email**.

   Click **Next**.

3. On the **Select technique** page, the available options are the same as on the **Select technique** page in the simulation creation wizard:

       - **Phishing link** control: This control is available only if you selected **Credential harvest**, **Link in attachment**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** on the **Select technique** page. Use this control to name and insert the URL that you previously selected in the **Phishing link** section.

       - **Malware attachment link** control: This control is available only if you selected **Link to malware** on the **Select technique** page. Use this control to name and insert the URL that you previously selected in the **Link for attachment** section.

       When you click **Phishing link** or **Malware attachment link**, a dialog opens that asks you to name the link. When you're finished, click **Confirm**.

       The value that's added in the message body (visible on the **Code** tab) is `<a href="${phishingUrl}" target="_blank">Name value you specified</a>`.

     - On the **Code** tab, you can view and modify the HTML code directly. Formatting and other controls like **Dynamic tag** and **Phishing link** or **Malware attachment link** aren't available.

     - The **Replace all links in the email message with the phishing link** toggle is available only if you selected **Credential harvest**, **Link to malware**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** on the **Select technique** page. This toggle can save time by replacing all links in the message with the previously selected **Phishing link** or **Link for attachment** URL. To do this, toggle the setting to on ![Toggle on icon.](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png).

   When you're finished, click **Next**.

6. The **Add indicators** page is available only if you selected **Credential harvest**, **Link in attachment**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** on the **Select technique** page.

   Indicators help employees identify the tell-tale signs of phishing messages.

   On the **Add indicators** page, click **Add indicator**. In the flyout that appears, configure the following settings:

   - **Select and indicator you would like to use** and **Where do you want to place this indicator on the payload?**:

     These values are interrelated. Where you can place the indicator depends on the type of indicator. The available values are described in the following table:

- Select the payload from the list by clicking the check box. Click the ![Edit payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit payload** icon that appears.
- Select the payload from the list by clicking anywhere in the row except the check box. In the details flyout that opens, click **Edit payload**.

The payload wizard opens with the settings and values of the selected payload. The steps are the same as described in the [Create payloads](#create-payloads) section.

## Copy payloads

To copy an existing payload on the **Tenant payloads** or **Global payloads** tabs, select the payload from the list by clicking the check box, and then click the ![Copy payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Copy payload** icon that appears.

The create payload wizard opens with the settings and values of the selected payload. The steps are the same as described in the [Create payloads](#create-payloads) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you copy a built-in payload on the **Global payloads** tab, be sure to change the **Name** value. If you don't, the payload will appear on the **Tenant payloads** page with the same name as the built-in payload.

## Send a test

On the **Tenant payloads** or **Global payloads** tabs, you can send a copy of the payload email to yourself (the currently logged in user) for inspection.

Select the payload from the list by clicking the check box, and then click the ![Send a test icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-send-icon.png) **Send a test** button that appears.
