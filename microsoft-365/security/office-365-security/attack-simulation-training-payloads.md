# Create a custom payload for Attack simulation training

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

Microsoft offers a robust payload catalog for various social engineering techniques to pair with your attack simulation training. However, you might want to create custom payloads that will work better for your organization. This article describes how to create a payload in Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

You can create a payload by clicking on **Create a payload** in either the [dedicated **Payloads** tab](https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=payload) or within the [simulation creation wizard](attack-simulation-training.md#selecting-a-payload).

The first step in the wizard will have you select a payload type. **Currently, only email is available**.

Next, select an associated technique. See more details on techniques at [Selecting a social engineering technique](attack-simulation-training.md#selecting-a-social-engineering-technique).

In the next step name your payload. Optionally, you can give it a description.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heighted protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.

## Configure payload

Now it's time to build your payload. Input the sender's name, email address, and the email's subject in the **Sender details** section. Pick a phishing URL from the provided list. This URL will later be embedded into the body of the message.

> [!TIP]
> You can choose an internal email for your payload's sender, which will make the payload appear as coming from another employee of the company. This will increase susceptibility to the payload and will help educate employees on the risk of internal threats.

A rich text editor is available to create your payload. You can also import an email that you've created beforehand. As you create the body of the email, take advantage of the **dynamic tags** to personalize the email to your targets. Click **Phishing link** to add the previously selected phishing URL into the body of the message.

> [!TIP]
> To save time, toggle on the option to **replace all links in the email message with the phishing link**.

Once you're done building the payload to your liking, click **Next**.

## Adding indicators

Indicators will help employees going through the attack simulation understand the clue they can look for in future attacks. To start, click **Add indicator**.

Select an indicator you'd like to use from the drop-down list. This list is curated to contain the most common clues that appear in phishing email messages. Once selected, make sure the indicator placement is set to **From the body of the email** and click on **Select text**. Highlight the portion of your payload where this indicator appears and click **Select**.

Add a custom description to describe the indicator and click within the indicator preview frame to see a preview of your indicator. Once done, click **Add**. Repeat these steps until you've covered all indicators in your payload.

## Review payload

You're done building your payload. Now it's time to review the details and see a preview of your payload. The preview will include all indicators that you've created. You can edit each part of the payload from this step. Once satisfied, you can **Submit** your payload.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Payloads that you've created will have **Tenant** as their source. When selecting payloads, make sure that you don't filter out **Tenant**.
