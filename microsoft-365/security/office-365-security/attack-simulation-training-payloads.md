# Payloads in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, a _payload_ is the link or attachment in the simulated phishing email message that's presented to users. Attack simulation training offers a robust built-in payload catalog for the available social engineering techniques. However, you might want to create custom payloads that work better for your organization.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the available payloads, open the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> and then select **Payloads**. Or, to go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads**, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

**Payloads** in the **Content library** tab has three tabs:

- **Global payloads**: Contains the built-in, unmodifiable payloads.
- **Tenant payloads**: Contains the custom payloads that you created.
- **MDO recommendations**: Payloads that are recommended by Defender for Office 365 as having considerable impact when used by attackers. This list is refreshed monthly.

The information that's available on the tabs is described in the following list:

- **MDO recommendations** tab: The following information is shown for each payload:
  - **Payload name**
  - **Compromised rate (%)**
  - **Recommended by**
  - **Recommendation date time**

- **Global payloads** and **Tenant payloads** tabs: The following information is shown for each payload. You can sort the payloads by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. The default columns are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):
  - **Payload name**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Type<sup>\*</sup>**: Currently, this value is always **Social engineering**.
  - **Platform**
  - **Technique**<sup>\*</sup>: One of the available [social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):
    - **Credential Harvest**
    - **Malware Attachment**
    - **Link in Attachment**
    - **Link to Malware**
    - **Drive-by URL**
    - **OAuth Consent Grant**
    - **How-to Guide**
  - **Language**<sup>\*</sup>: If the payload contains multiple translations, the first two languages are shown directly. To see the remaining languages, hover over the numeric icon (for example, **+10**).
  - **Simulations launched**<sup>\*</sup>: The number of launched simulations that use the payload.
  - **Source**
  - **Predicted compromised rate (%)**<sup>\*</sup>: Historical data across Microsoft 365 that predicts the percentage of people who will be compromised by this payload (users compromised / total number of users who receive the payload). For more information, see [Predicted compromise rate](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#predicted-compromise-rate).
  - **Created by**<sup>\*</sup>: For built-in payloads, the value is **Microsoft**. For custom payloads, the value is the user principal name (UPN) of the user who created the payload.
  - **Last modified**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Status**<sup>\*</sup>: Values are:
    - **Ready**
    - **Draft**: Available only on the **Tenant payloads** tab.
    - **Archive**: Archived payloads are visible only when **Show archived payloads** is toggled on :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.
  - **⋮** (**Actions** control)<sup>\*</sup>: Take action on the payload. The available actions depend on the **Status** value of the payload as described in the procedure sections. This control always appears at the end of the payload row.

  > [!TIP]
  > To see all columns, you likely need to do one or more of the following steps:
  >
  > - Horizontally scroll in your web browser.
  > - Narrow the width of appropriate columns.
  > - Remove columns from the view.
  > - Zoom out in your web browser.

  To find a payload in the list, type part of the payload name in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box and then press the ENTER key.

  Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: to filter the payloads by one or of the following values:

## Create payloads

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heightened protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> **Payloads** \> **Tenant payloads** tab. To go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads** and the **Tenant payloads** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

   On the **Tenant payloads** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Create a payload** to start the new payload wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/attack-sim-training-payload-create.png" alt-text="Create a payload on the Tenant payloads tab in Payloads in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/attack-sim-training-payload-create.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > At any point after you name the payload during the new payload wizard, you can select **Save and close** to save your progress and continue later. The incomplete payload has the **Status** value **Draft**. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the payload and then clicking the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit payload** action that appears.
   >
   > You can also create payloads during the creation of simulations. For more information, see [Create a simulation: Select a payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page).

2. On the **Select type** page, select one of the following values:
   - **Email**
   - **Teams**: Currently, this value is available only in Private Preview. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-teams.md).

   When you're finished on the **Select type** page, select **Next**.

3. On the **Select technique** page, the available options are the same as on the **Select technique** page in the new simulation wizard:

The payload wizard opens with the settings and values of the selected payload. The steps are the same as described in the [Create payloads](#create-payloads) section.

## Copy payloads

To copy an existing payload on the **Tenant payloads** or **Global payloads** tabs, do one of the following steps:

- Select the payload by clicking the check box next to the name, and then select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy payload** action that appears.
- Select the payload by clicking **⋮** (**Actions**) at the end of the row, and then select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy payload**.

The create payload wizard opens with the settings and values of the selected payload. The steps are the same as described in the [Create payloads](#create-payloads) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you copy a built-in payload on the **Global payloads** tab, be sure to change the **Name** value. If you don't, the payload will appear on the **Tenant payloads** page with the same name as the built-in payload.

## Archive payloads

You can't delete custom payloads from the **Tenant payloads** tab, but you can archive them.

To archive an existing payload on the **Tenant payloads** tab, select the payload by clicking **⋮** (**Actions**) at the end of the row, and then select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-archive-icon.png" border="false"::: **Archive**.

The **Status** value of the payload changes to **Archive**, and the payload is no longer visible on the **Tenant payloads** table when **Show archived payloads** is toggled off :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-off.png" border="false":::.

To see archived payloads on the **Tenant payloads** tab, toggle **Show archived payloads** to on :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.

## Restore archived payloads

To restore an archive payload on the **Tenant payloads** tab, do the following steps:

1. Set the **Show archived payloads** toggle to on :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.
2. Select the payload by clicking **⋮** (**Actions**) at the end of the row, and then select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-archive-icon.png" border="false"::: **Restore**.

After you've restored the archived payload, the **Status** value changes to **Draft**. Toggle **Show archived payloads** to off :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-off.png" border="false"::: to see the restored payload. To return the payload to the **Status** value **Ready**, [edit the payload](#modify-payloads), review or change the settings, and then select **Submit**.
