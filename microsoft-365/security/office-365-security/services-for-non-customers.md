# Services for non-customers sending mail to Office 365

Email abuse, junk email, and fraudulent emails (phishing) continue to burden the entire email ecosystem. To help maintain user trust in the use of email, Microsoft has put in place various policies and technologies to help protect our users. However, Microsoft understands that legitimate email should not be negatively affected. Therefore, we have established a suite of services to help senders improve their ability to deliver email to Office 365 users by proactively managing their sending reputation.

This overview provides information about benefits we provide to your organization even if you aren't an Office 365 customer.

## Microsoft support

Microsoft offers several support options for people having trouble sending mail to Office 365 inboxes. We recommend that you:

- Follow the instructions in any non-delivery report you receive.

- Check out the most common problems that non-customers encounter in [Troubleshooting mail sent to Office 365](troubleshooting-mail-sent-to-office-365.md).

- Use the [Office 365 delist portal](https://sender.office.com) to submit a request to have your IP removed from the blocked sender's list.

- Read the [Microsoft community forums](https://community.office365.com/f/).

- Contact the Office 365 customer you're trying to email using another method and ask them to contact Microsoft Support and open a support ticket on your behalf. In some cases, for legal reasons, Microsoft Support must communicate directly with the sender who owns the IP space that is being blocked. However, non-customers typically can't open support tickets.

  For more information about Microsoft Technical support for Office 365, see [Support](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-365-support.aspx).

## Office 365 Anti-Spam IP Delist Portal

This is a self-service portal you can use to remove yourself from the Office 365 blocked senders list. Use this portal if you are you getting an error message when you try to send an email to a recipient whose email address is in Office 365 and you don't think you should be. For more information, see [Use the delist portal to remove yourself from the Office 365 blocked senders list](use-the-delist-portal-to-remove-yourself-from-the-office-365-blocked-senders-lis.md).

## Abuse and spam reporting for junk email originating from Exchange Online

Sometimes Office 365 is used by third parties to send junk email, in violation of our terms of use and policy. If you receive any junk email from Office 365, you can report these messages to [junk@office365.microsoft.com](mailto:junk@office365.microsoft.com). Please attach the offending messages, including the full message header, in RFC 5322 or ARF format. Outlook on the web users can use built-in tools to report junk email. For information, see [Report junk email and phishing scams in Outlook on the web](report-junk-email-and-phishing-scams-in-outlook-on-the-web-eop.md).
