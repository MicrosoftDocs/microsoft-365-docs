# Run an administrator role group report in standalone EOP

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
-  [Exchange Online Protection standalone](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)

In standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, when an admin adds members to or removes members from administrative role groups, the service logs each occurrence. For more information about role groups in standalone EOP, see [Permissions in standalone EOP](feature-permissions-in-eop.md).

When you run an administrator role group report in the Exchange admin center (EAC), entries are displayed as search results and include the role groups affected, who changed the role group membership and when, and what membership updates were made. Use this report to monitor changes to the administrative permissions assigned to users in your organization.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To open the Exchange admin center, see [Exchange admin center in standalone EOP](exchange-admin-center-in-exchange-online-protection-eop.md).

- You need to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online Protection before you can do the procedures in this article. Specifically, you need the **Audit Logs** or **View-Only Audit Logs** role, which are assigned to the **Organization Management**, **Compliance Management**, and **Security Administrator** role groups by default. For more information, see [Permissions in standalone EOP](feature-permissions-in-eop.md) and [Use the EAC modify the list of members in role groups](manage-admin-role-group-permissions-in-eop.md#use-the-eac-modify-the-list-of-members-in-role-groups).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this article, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](/Exchange/accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center).

## Use the EAC to run an administrator role group report

Run the administrator role group report to find the changes to management role groups within a particular time frame.

1. In the EAC, go to **Compliance management** \> **Auditing**, and then choose **Run an administrator role group report**.

2. In the **Search for changes to administrator role groups** page that opens, configure the following settings:

   - **Start date** and **End date**: Enter a date range. By default, the report searches for changes made to administrator role groups in the past two weeks.

   - **Select role groups**: By default, all role groups are searched. To filter the results by specific role groups, click **Select role groups**. In the dialog that appears, select a role group and click **add ->**. Repeat this step as many times as necessary, and then click **OK** when you're finished.

3. When you're finished, click **Search**.

If any changes are found using the criteria you specified, they will appear in the results pane. Click a role group in the search results to see the changes in the details pane.

## How do you know this worked?

If you've successfully run an administrator role group report, role groups that have been changed within the date range are displayed in the search results pane. If there are no results, then no changes to role groups have taken place within the specified date range. If you think there should be results, change the date range and then run the report again.

## Monitor changes to role group membership

When members are added to or removed from a role group, the search results displayed in the details pane indicate that the role group membership was updated and lists the current members. The results don't explicitly state which user was added or removed.

To determine if a user was added or removed, you have to compare two separate entries in the report. For example, let's look at the following log entries for the **HelpDesk** role group:

> 1/27/2018 4:43 PM <br> Administrator <br> Updated members: Administrator;annb,florencef;pilarp <br> 2/06/2018 10:09 AM <br> Administrator <br> Updated members: Administrator;annb;florencef;pilarp;tonip <br> 2/19/2018 2:12 PM <br> Administrator <br> Updated members: Administrator;annb;florencef;tonip

In this example, the Administrator user account made the following changes:

- On 2/06/2018, they added the user tonip.
- On 2/19/2018, they removed the user pilarp.

## Use standalone Exchange Online PowerShell to search for audit log entries

You can use Exchange Online PowerShell to search for audit log entries that meet the criteria you specify. For a list of search criteria, see [Search-AdminAuditLog search criteria](/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/admin-audit-logging/admin-audit-logging#search-adminauditlog-cmdlet). This procedure uses the **Search-AdminAuditLog** cmdlet and displays search results in Exchange Online PowerShell. You can use this cmdlet when you need to return a set of results that exceeds the limits defined on the **New-AdminAuditLogSearch** cmdlet or in the EAC Audit Reporting reports.

To search the audit log for criteria you specify, use the following syntax.

```PowerShell
Search-AdminAuditLog - Cmdlets <cmdlet 1, cmdlet 2, ...> -Parameters <parameter 1, parameter 2, ...> -StartDate <start date> -EndDate <end date> -UserIds <user IDs> -ObjectIds <object IDs> -IsSuccess <$True | $False >
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **Search-AdminAuditLog** cmdlet returns a maximum of 1,000 log entries by default. Use the _ResultSize_ parameter to specify up to 250,000 log entries. Or, use the value `Unlimited` to return all entries.

This example performs a search for all audit log entries with the following criteria:

- **Start date**: 08/04/2018
- **End date**: 10/03/2018
- **User IDs**: `davids`, `chrisd`, `kima`
- **Cmdlets**: **Set-Mailbox**
- **Parameters**: _ProhibitSendQuota_, _ProhibitSendReceiveQuota_, _IssueWarningQuota_, _MaxSendSize_, _MaxReceiveSize_

```PowerShell
Search-AdminAuditLog -Cmdlets Set-Mailbox -Parameters ProhibitSendQuota,ProhibitSendReceiveQuota,IssueWarningQuota,MaxSendSize,MaxReceiveSize -StartDate 08/04/2018 -EndDate 10/03/2018 -UserIds davids,chrisd,kima
```

This example searches for changes made to a specific mailbox. This is useful if you're troubleshooting or you need to provide information for an investigation. The following criteria are used:

- **Start date**: 05/01/2018
- **End date**: 10/03/2018
- **Object ID**: contoso.com/Users/DavidS

```PowerShell
Search-AdminAuditLog -StartDate 05/01/2018 -EndDate 10/03/2018 -ObjectID contoso.com/Users/DavidS
```

If your searches return many log entries, we recommend that you use the procedure provided in **Use Exchange Online PowerShell to search for audit log entries and send results to a recipient** later in this article. The procedure in that section sends an XML file as an email attachment to the recipients you specify, enabling you to more easily extract the data you're interested in.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Search-AdminAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-adminauditlog).

### View details of audit log entries

The **Search-AdminAuditLog** cmdlet returns the fields described in [Audit log contents](/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/admin-audit-logging/admin-audit-logging#audit-log-contents). Of the fields returned by the cmdlet, two fields, **CmdletParameters** and **ModifiedProperties**, contain additional information that isn't viewable by default.

To view the contents of the **CmdletParameters** and **ModifiedProperties** fields, use the following steps. Or, you can use the procedure in **Use Exchange Online PowerShell to search for audit log entries and send results to a recipient** later in this article to create an XML file.

This procedure uses the following concepts:

- [about_Arrays](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_arrays)

- [about_Variables](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_variables)

1. Decide the criteria you want to search for, run the **Search-AdminAuditLog** cmdlet, and store the results in a variable using the following command.

   ```PowerShell
   $Results = Search-AdminAuditLog <search criteria>
   ```

2. Each audit log entry is stored as an array element in the variable `$Results`. You can select an array element by specifying its array element index. Array element indexes start at zero (0) for the first array element. For example, to retrieve the 5th array element, which has an index of 4, use the following command.

   ```PowerShell
   $Results[4]
   ```

3. The previous command returns the log entry stored in array element 4. To see the contents of the **CmdletParameters** and **ModifiedProperties** fields for this log entry, use the following commands.

   ```PowerShell
   $Results[4].CmdletParameters
   $Results[4].ModifiedProperties
   ```

4. To view the contents of the **CmdletParameters** or **ModifiedParameters** fields in another log entry, change the array element index.
