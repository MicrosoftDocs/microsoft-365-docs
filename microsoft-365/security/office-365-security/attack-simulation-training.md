# Simulate a phishing attack in Defender for Office 365

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft 365 E5 lets you run benign cyberattack simulations in your organization. These simulations test your security policies and practices, as well as train your employees to increase their awareness and decrease their susceptibility to attacks. This article walks you through creating a simulated phishing attack using Attack simulation training.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To launch a simulated phishing attack, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulations** tab.

   To go directly to the **Simulations** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>.

2. On the **Simulations** tab, select ![Launch a simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Launch a simulation**.

   ![Launch a simulation button on the Simulations tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.](../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-launch.png)

3. The simulation creation wizard opens. The rest of this article describes the pages and the settings they contain.

> [!NOTE]
> At any point during the simulation creation wizard, you can click **Save and close** to save your progress and continue configuring the simulation later. The incomplete simulation has the **Status** value **Draft** on the **Simulations** tab. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the simulation and clicking ![Edit simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** simulation.

## Select a social engineering technique

On the **Select technique** page, select an available social engineering technique, which was curated from the [MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/). Different payloads are available for different techniques. The following social engineering techniques are available:

- **Credential harvest**: Attempts to collect credentials by taking users to a well-known looking website with input boxes to submit a username and password.
- **Malware attachment**: Adds a malicious attachment to a message. When the user opens the attachment, arbitrary code is run that will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Link in attachment**: A type of credential harvest hybrid. An attacker inserts a URL into an email attachment. The URL within the attachment follows the same technique as credential harvest.
- **Link to malware**: Runs some arbitrary code from a file hosted on a well-known file sharing service. The message sent to the user will contain a link to this malicious file. Opening the file will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Drive-by URL**: The malicious URL in the message takes the user to a familiar-looking website that silently runs and/or installs code on the user's device.

If you click the **View details** link in the description, a details flyout opens that describes the technique and the simulation steps that result from the technique.

![Details flyout for the credential harvest technique on the Select technique page.](../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png)

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Name and describe the simulation

On the **Name simulation** page, configure the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the simulation.
- **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the simulation.

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Select a payload

On the **Select payload** page, you need to select an existing payload from the list, or create a new payload.
