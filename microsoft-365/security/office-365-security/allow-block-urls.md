# Allow or block URLs using the Tenant Allow/Block List

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

This article describes how to create and manage URL allow and block entries that are available in the Tenant Allow/Block List. For more information about the Tenant Allow/Block List, see [Manage your allows and blocks in the Tenant Allow/Block List](manage-tenant-allow-block-list.md).

You manage allow and block entries for URLs in the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal or in Exchange Online PowerShell.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- For URL entry syntax, see the [URL syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List](#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list) section later in this article.

- For URLs, the maximum number of allow entries is 500, and the maximum number of block entries is 500 (1000 URL entries total).

- You can enter a maximum of 250 characters in a URL entry.

- An entry should be active within 30 minutes, but it might take up to 24 hours for the entry to be active.

- You need to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online before you can do the procedures in this article:
  - To add and remove values from the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:
    - **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role group (**Security admin role**)
    - **Security Operator** role group (**Tenant AllowBlockList Manager**).
  - For read-only access to the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:
    - **Global Reader**  role group
    - **Security Reader** role group
    - **View-Only configuration** role group

  For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

  **Notes**:

  - Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  - The **View-Only Organization Management** role group in [Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups) also gives read-only access to the feature.

## Create block entries for URLs

You have the following options to create block entries for URLs:

- [The Submissions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-urls-in-the-submissions-portal)
- The Tenant Allow/Block List in [the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-urls-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) or in [PowerShell](#use-powershell-to-create-block-entries-for-urls-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list)

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for URLs in the Submissions portal

When you use the Submissions portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> to report URLs as **Should have been blocked (False negative)**, you can select **Block this file** to add a block entry for the URL in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

For instructions, see [Report questionable URLs to Microsoft](admin-submission.md#report-questionable-urls-to-microsoft).

### Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for URLs in the Tenant Allow/Block List

You create block entries for URLs directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

> [!NOTE]
> Email messages that contain these blocked URLs are blocked as *high confidence phishing*.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. On the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, select the **URLs** tab.

3. On the **URLs** tab, click ![Block icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Block**.

4. In the **Block URLs** flyout that appears, configure the following settings:

   - **Add URLs with wildcards**: Enter one URL per line, up to a maximum of 20. For details about the syntax for URL entries, see the [URL syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List](#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list) section later in this article.

   - **Remove block entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
     - **Never expire**
     - **1 day**
     - **7 days**
     - **30 days**
     - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 90 days from today.

   - **Optional note**: Enter descriptive text for the entries.

5. When you're finished, click **Add**.

#### Use PowerShell to create block entries for URLs in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -Block -Entries "Value1","Value2",..."ValueN" <-ExpirationDate <Date> | -NoExpiration> [-Notes <String>]
```

This example adds a block URL entry for contoso.com and all subdomains (for example, contoso.com and xyz.abc.contoso.com). Because we didn't use the ExpirationDate or NoExpiration parameters, the entry expires after 30 days.

```powershell
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -Block -Entries ~contoso.com
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistitems).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for URLs in the Submissions portal

You can't create URL allow entries directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List. Instead, you use the Submissions portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission> to report the message as a false positive. For more information about admin submissions, see [Use the Submissions portal to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, legitimate email getting blocked, and email attachments to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

Reporting the URL as a false positive on the **Submissions** page adds an allow entry for the URL in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because Microsoft manages allow entries for you, unneeded URL allow entries will be removed. This behavior protects your organization and helps prevent misconfigured allow entries. If you disagree with the verdict, you might need to open a support case to help determine why a URL is still considered bad.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to the **Submissions** page at **Actions & submissions** \> **Submissions**. To go directly to the **Submissions** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

2. On the **Submissions** page, select the **URLs** tab

3. On the **URLs** tab, click ![Submit to Microsoft for analysis icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Submit to Microsoft for analysis**.

4. In the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout that appears, enter the following information:

   - **Select the submission type**: Verify the value **URL** is selected.

   - **URL**: Enter the full URL (for example, `https://www.fabrikam.com/marketing.html`), and then select it in the box that appears.

   - **Select a reason for submitting to Microsoft**: Select **Should not have been blocked (False positive)**, and then configure the following settings:

     - **Allow this URL**: Turn on this setting ![Toggle on.](../../media/scc-toggle-on.png).

         - **Remove allow entry after**: The default value is **30 days**, but you can select from the following values:
           - **1 day**
           - **7 days**
           - **30 days**
           - **Specific date**: The maximum value is 30 days from today.

         - **Allow entry note**: Enter optional information about why you're allowing this URL.

   When you're finished, click **Submit**, and then click **Done**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/admin-submission-url-allow.png" alt-text="Submit a false positive (good) URL to Microsoft for analysis on the Submissions page in the Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/admin-submission-url-allow.png":::

5. After a few moments, the URL allow entry will appear on the **URL** tab on the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When the URL is detected again, it's not sent for [Safe Links](safe-links.md) detonation or URL reputation checks, and all other URL-based filters are skipped.
> - During mail flow, if messages containing the URL pass other non-URL checks in the filtering stack, the messages will be delivered.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to view allow or block entries for URLs in the Tenant Allow/Block List

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists** in the **Rules** section.

```

This example filters the results by blocked URLs.

```powershell
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -Block
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/get-tenantallowblocklistitems).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify allow or block entries for URLs in the Tenant Allow/Block List

When you modify an allow or block URL entry in the Tenant Allow/Block list, you can only modify the expiration date and notes.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Policies & rules** \> **Threat Policies** \> **Rules** section \> **Tenant Allow/Block Lists**. Or, to go directly to the **Tenant Allow/Block List** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList>.

2. Select the **URLs** tab

3. On the **URLs** tab, select the check box of the entry that you want to modify, and then click the ![Edit icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** button that appears.

4. The following values are available in the **Edit URL** flyout that appears:

   - **Remove allow entry after** or **Remove block entry after**:
     - You can extend allow entries for a maximum of 30 days after the creation date.
     - You can extend block entries for a maximum of 90 days after the creation date or set them to **Never expire**.

   - **Optional note**

   When you're finished, click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> For allow entries only, if you select the entry by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box, you can select ![View submission icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-submission-icon.png) **View submission** in the details flyout that appears to go to the **Submissions** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission>.

### Use PowerShell to modify allow or block entries for URLs in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url <-Ids <Identity value> | -Entries <Value value>> [<-ExpirationDate Date | -NoExpiration>] [-Notes <String>]
```

This example changes the expiration date of the specified block URL entry.

```powershell
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -Entries "~contoso.com" -ExpirationDate "9/1/2022"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/set-tenantallowblocklistitems).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to remove allow or block entries for URLs from the Tenant Allow/Block List

### Use PowerShell to remove allow or block entries for URLs from the Tenant Allow/Block List

In [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following syntax:

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url <-Ids <Identity value> | -Entries <Value value>>
```

This example removes the specified block URL entry from the Tenant Allow/Block List.

```powershell
Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -Entries "~cohovineyard.com
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-TenantAllowBlockListItems](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-tenantallowblocklistitems).

## URL syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List

- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are allowed, but TCP/UDP ports are not.

- Filename extensions are not allowed (for example, test.pdf).

- Unicode is not supported, but Punycode is.

- Hostnames are allowed if all of the following statements are true:
  - The hostname contains a period.
  - There is at least one character to the left of the period.
  - There are at least two characters to the right of the period.

  For example, `t.co` is allowed; `.com` or `contoso.` are not allowed.

- Subpaths are not implied for allows.

  For example, `contoso.com` does not include `contoso.com/a`.

- Wildcards (*) are allowed in the following scenarios:

  - A left wildcard must be followed by a period to specify a subdomain. (only applicable for blocks)

    For example, `*.contoso.com` is allowed; `*contoso.com` is not allowed.

  - A right wildcard must follow a forward slash (/) to specify a path.

    For example, `contoso.com/*` is allowed; `contoso.com*` or `contoso.com/ab*` are not allowed.

  - `*.com*` is invalid (not a resolvable domain and the right wildcard does not follow a forward slash).

  - Wildcards are not allowed in IP addresses.

- The tilde (~) character is available in the following scenarios:

  - A left tilde implies a domain and all subdomains.

    For example `~contoso.com` includes `contoso.com` and `*.contoso.com`.

- A username or password isn't supported or required.

- Quotes (' or ") are invalid characters.

- A URL should include all redirects where possible.
