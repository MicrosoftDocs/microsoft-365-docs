## Test Lab Guides

To create a dev/test environment for this solution, use the following test lab guides:

- [Configure groups and users for a political campaign dev/test environment](configure-groups-and-users-for-a-political-campaign-dev-test-environment.md)

  Create trial subscriptions for Office 365 and EMS and then create groups and users for a representative political campaign.

- [Create team sites in a political campaign dev/test environment](create-team-sites-in-a-political-campaign-dev-test-environment.md)

  Create four SharePoint Online team sites with Internal, Private, Sensitive, and Highly Confidential levels of security.

For additional security features for demonstration or proof of concept, see [Office 365 Test Lab Guides](https://aka.ms/o365tlgs).
