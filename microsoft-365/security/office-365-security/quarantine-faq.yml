    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I manage messages that were quarantined for malware?
        answer: |
          By default, only admins can manage messages that were quarantined for malware. For more information, see [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md).

          But, admins can create and apply _quarantine policies_ to anti-malware policies that define more capabilities for users. For more information, see [Create quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).

          Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware or high-confidence phishing messages.

      - question: |
          How do I quarantine spam?
        answer: |
          By default, messages that are classified as spam or bulk email by spam filtering are delivered to the user's mailbox, and are moved to the Junk Email folder. But you can configure anti-spam policies to quarantine spam or bulk email messages instead. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

      - question: |
          How do I give users access to the quarantine?
        answer: |
          A user must have a valid account to access their own messages in quarantine. Standalone EOP requires that users are represented as mail users in EOP (manually created or created via directory synchronization). For more information about managing users in standalone EOP environments, see [Manage mail users in standalone EOP](/exchange/standalone-eop/manage-mail-users-in-eop).

      - question: |
          What messages can end users access in quarantine?
        answer: |
          Quarantine policies define whether users can access quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined for [supported features](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features). 

          For the default access to quarantined messages, see the table in [Find and release quarantined messages as a user in EOP](quarantine-end-user.md)

          Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as **malware** by anti-malware or Safe Attachments policies, or as **high confidence phishing** by anti-spam policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware or high-confidence phishing messages.

      - question: |
          How long are messages kept in the quarantine?
        answer: |
          It depends why the message was quarantined. For more information, see [Quarantined messages in EOP and Defender for Office 365](quarantine-about.md).

      - question: |
          Can I release or report more than one quarantined message at a time?
        answer: |
          In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you can select and release up to 100 messages at a time.

          Admins can use the [Get-QuarantineMessage](/powershell/module/exchange/get-quarantinemessage) and [Release-QuarantineMessage](/powershell/module/exchange/release-quarantinemessage) cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell to find and release quarantined messages in bulk, and to report false positives in bulk.

      - question: |
          Are wildcards supported when searching for quarantined messages? Can I search for quarantined messages for a specific domain?
        answer: |
          Wildcards aren't supported in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. For example, when searching for a sender, you need to specify the full email address. But, you can use wildcards in Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell.

          For example, copy the following PowerShell code into NotePad and save the file as .ps1 in a location that's easy for you to find (for example, C:\Data\QuarantineRelease.ps1).

          Then, after you connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) or [Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell), run the following command to run the script:

          ```powershell
          & C:\Data\QuarantineRelease.ps1
          ```

          The script does the following actions:

          - Find unreleased messages that were quarantined as spam from all senders in the fabrikam domain. The maximum number of results is 50,000 (50 pages of 1000 results).
          - Save the results to a CSV file.
          - Release the matching quarantined messages to all original recipients.

          ```powershell
          $Page = 1
          $List = $null

          Do
          {
          Write-Host "Getting Page " $Page

          $List = (Get-QuarantineMessage -Type Spam -PageSize 1000 -Page $Page | where {$_.Released -like "False" -and $_.SenderAddress -like "*fabrikam.com"})
          Write-Host "                     " $List.count " rows in this page match"
          Write-Host "                                                             Exporting list to appended CSV for logging"
          $List | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Data\Quarantined Message Matches.csv" -Append -NoTypeInformation

          Write-Host "Releasing page " $Page
          $List | foreach {Release-QuarantineMessage -Identity $_.Identity -ReleaseToAll}

          $Page = $Page + 1

          } Until ($Page -eq 50)
          ```

          After you release a message, you can't release it again.
