    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I manage messages that were quarantined for malware?
        answer: |
          By default, only admins can manage messages that were quarantined for malware. For more information, see [Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md).

          But, admins can create and apply _quarantine policies_ to anti-malware policies that define more capabilities for users. For more information, see [Create quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal).

          Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware or high-confidence phishing messages.

      - question: |
          How do I quarantine spam?
        answer: |
          By default, messages that are classified as spam or bulk are delivered and moved to the Junk Email folder by the following anti-spam policies:

          - The default anti-spam policy.
          - Custom anti-spam policies.
          - The Standard preset security policy.

          Admins can configure the default anti-spam or custom policies to quarantine spam or bulk email messages instead. For more information, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

          The Strict preset security policy quarantines messages that are classified as spam or bulk.

          For more information, see the following articles:

          - [EOP anti-spam policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#eop-anti-spam-policy-settings)
          - [Profiles in preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md#profiles-in-preset-security-policies)

      - question: |
          How do I give users access to the quarantine?
        answer: |
          A user must have a valid account to access their own messages in quarantine. Standalone EOP requires that users are represented as mail users in EOP (manually created or created via directory synchronization). For more information about managing users in standalone EOP environments, see [Manage mail users in standalone EOP](/exchange/standalone-eop/manage-mail-users-in-eop).

          Quarantine policies determine whether users can access their quarantined messages, and what they're allowed to do to them. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

          If the quarantine policy requires users to request the release of messages or requires admins to release messages, an admin must [approve the release request](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#approve-or-deny-release-requests-from-users-for-quarantined-email) or [release the message](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#release-quarantined-email) before the message is available to users.

      - question: |
          What messages can end users access in quarantine?
        answer: |
          Quarantine policies define whether users can access quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined.

          For the default access to quarantined messages, see the table in [Find and release quarantined messages as a user in EOP](quarantine-end-user.md)

          Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as **malware** by anti-malware or Safe Attachments policies, or as **high confidence phishing** by anti-spam policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware or high-confidence phishing messages.

      - question: |
          How can I prevent users from accessing quarantined messages?
        answer: |
          The default quarantine policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy prevents any user interaction with their quarantined messages. By default, this quarantine policy is used for messages that were quarantined as malware or high confidence phishing. In custom policies or the default policy for [protection features that support quarantining messages](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features), admins can specify the AdminOnlyAccessPolicy as the quarantine policy to use.

      - question: |
          How do I find out why a message was quarantined?
        answer: |
          The **Quarantine reason** column that's available on the **Email** tab of the **Quarantine** page in the Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine?viewid=Email>. Common reasons are **Transport rule**, **Bulk**, **Spam**, **Malware**, **Phishing**, **High confidence phishing**, or **Admin action - File type block**. For more information, see [View quarantined email](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#view-quarantined-email).

      - question: |
          Messages are missing from quarantine. What happened to them?
        answer: |
          Before you open a support ticket about this, see [Find who deleted a quarantined message](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#find-who-deleted-a-quarantined-message).

          Quarantined messages also expire and are eventually removed from quarantine, depending on why the message was quarantined. For more information, see [Quarantine retention](quarantine-about.md#quarantine-retention).

          The [common attachments filter in anti-malware policies](anti-malware-protection-about.md#common-attachments-filter-in-anti-malware-policies) identifies message attachments with the specified file extensions (using true type matching were possible). The default action for these detections in the default anti-malware policy and in the Standard and strict preset security policies is to reject the message in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message). If the released message contains one of the specified file attachment types, it's possible that the message was returned to the sender in an NDR.

          When a message expires from quarantine, you can't recover it.

      - question: |
          A message was released from quarantine, but the original recipient can't find it. How can I determine what happened to the message? OR Messages are released unexpectedly from Quarantine?
        answer: |
          Third party anti-virus solutions or security services as well as outbound connectors can cause the following issues for messages that are released from quarantine:

          - The message is quarantined after being released.
          - Content is removed from the released message before it reaches the recipient's Inbox.
          - The released message never arrives in the recipient's Inbox.
          - Action buttons in [quarantine notifications](quarantine-quarantine-notifications.md) might be randomly selected.

          Verify that you aren't using third party filtering before you open a support ticket about these issues.

          Admins can use [message trace](message-trace-defender-portal.md) to determine if a released message was delivered to the recipient's Inbox.

      - question: |
          Can I release or report more than one quarantined message at a time?
        answer: |
          In the Microsoft Defender portal, you can select and release up to 100 messages at a time.

          Admins can use the [Get-QuarantineMessage](/powershell/module/exchange/get-quarantinemessage) and [Release-QuarantineMessage](/powershell/module/exchange/release-quarantinemessage) cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell to find and release quarantined messages in bulk, and to report false positives in bulk.

      - question: |
          Are wildcards supported when searching for quarantined messages? Can I search for quarantined messages for a specific domain?
        answer: |
          Wildcards aren't supported in the Microsoft Defender portal. For example, when searching for a sender, you need to specify the full email address. But, you can use wildcards in Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell.

          For example, copy the following PowerShell code into NotePad and save the file as .ps1 in a location that's easy for you to find (for example, C:\Data\QuarantineRelease.ps1).

          Then, after you connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) or [Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell), run the following command to run the script:

          ```powershell
          & C:\Data\QuarantineRelease.ps1
          ```

          The script does the following actions:

          - Find unreleased messages that were quarantined as spam from all senders in the fabrikam domain. The maximum number of results is 50,000 (50 pages of 1000 results).
          - Save the results to a CSV file.
          - Release the matching quarantined messages to all original recipients.

          ```powershell
          $Page = 1
          $List = $null

          Do
          {
          Write-Host "Getting Page " $Page

          $List = (Get-QuarantineMessage -Type Spam -PageSize 1000 -Page $Page | where {$_.Released -like "False" -and $_.SenderAddress -like "*fabrikam.com"})
          Write-Host "                     " $List.count " rows in this page match"
          Write-Host "                                                             Exporting list to appended CSV for logging"
          $List | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Data\Quarantined Message Matches.csv" -Append -NoTypeInformation

          Write-Host "Releasing page " $Page
          $List | foreach {Release-QuarantineMessage -Identity $_.Identity -ReleaseToAll}

          $Page = $Page + 1

          } Until ($Page -eq 50)
          ```

          After you release a message, you can't release it again.

      - question: |
          How do I notify end users about their quarantined messages? How frequently are quarantine notifications sent?
        answer: |
          If [quarantine notifications](quarantine-quarantine-notifications.md) are enabled in the associated [quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md), you can configure quarantine notifications to be sent every four hours, daily, or weekly. For more information, see [Customize all quarantine notifications](quarantine-policies.md#customize-all-quarantine-notifications).

          > [!TIP]
          > The fastest, most frequent notification schedule that's available is every four hours.
          >
          > If you select every four hours, and a message is quarantined _just after_ the last notification generation, the recipient will receive the quarantine notification _slightly more than_ four hours later.

      - question: |
          Why aren't users receiving notifications about their quarantined messages?
        answer: |
          If the quarantine policy that's defined for the [supported quarantine action](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) doesn't have notifications turned on, the quarantine notifications aren't sent.

          For more information, see the last table in [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy) and the individual feature tables in [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md) to see which default quarantine policies have quarantine notifications turned on.

          Also, the protection policies in [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md) are always applied _before_ custom protection policies. A user who's defined in the Standard or Strict preset security policy will never get a customized protection policy where the quarantine policy is customized to turn on quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Policy settings in preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md#policy-settings-in-preset-security-policies)

      - question: |
          How do I customize quarantine notifications to add a custom logo?
        answer: |
          See [Customize all quarantine notifications](quarantine-policies.md#customize-all-quarantine-notifications).

      - question: |
          What permissions are required for admins to download or release messages from quarantine?
        answer: |
          See the permissions entry [here](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#what-do-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin).

          > [!TIP]
          > The ability to manage quarantined messages using [Exchange Online permissions](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo) ended in February 2023 per MC447339.
          >
          > Guest admins from other organizations can't manage quarantined messages. The admin needs to be in the same organization as the recipients.

      - question: |
          I created a custom quarantine notification for a specific language, but users aren't seeing it. What's going on?
        answer: |
          A custom quarantine notification for a different language is shown to users only when their account/mailbox language matches the language in the custom quarantine notification.

      - question: |
          I can't preview a quarantined Microsoft Teams message. What's going on?
        answer: |
          If a user deletes the message from the Teams client, the message is gone, so Preview isn't available in quarantine for the deleted message.
