# Trial user guide: Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 trial user guide! This user guide helps you make the most of your free trial by teaching you how to safeguard your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools.

## What is Defender for Office 365?

Defender for Office 365 helps organizations secure their enterprise by offering a comprehensive slate of capabilities, including threat protection policies, reports, threat investigation and response capabilities, and automated investigation and response capabilities.

In addition to the detection of advanced threats, the following video shows how the SecOps capabilities of Defender for Office 365 can help your team respond to threats:

### Audit mode vs. blocking mode for Defender for Office 365

Do you want your Defender for Office 365 experience to be active or passive? These are the two modes that you can select from:

- **Audit mode**: Special *evaluation policies* are created for anti-phishing (which includes impersonation protection), Safe Attachments, and Safe Links. These evaluation policies are configured to *detect* threats only. Defender for Office 365 detects harmful messages for reporting, but the messages aren't acted upon (for example, detected messages aren't quarantined). The settings of these evaluation policies are described in the [Policies in audit mode](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#policies-in-audit-mode) section later in this article.

  Audit mode provides access to customized reports for threats detected by the evaluation policies in Defender for Office 365 on the **Microsoft Defender for Office 365 evaluation** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/atpEvaluation>.

- **Blocking mode**: The Standard template for [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md#profiles-in-preset-security-policies) is turned on and used for the trial, and the users you specify to include in the trial are added to the Standard preset security policy. Defender for Office 365 *detects* and *takes action on* harmful messages (for example, detected messages are quarantined).

  The default and recommended selection is to scope these Defender for Office 365 policies to all users in the organization. But, during or after the setup of your trial, you can change the policy assignment to specific users, groups, or email domains in the Microsoft Defender portal or in PowerShell.

  Blocking mode doesn't provide customized reports for threats detected by Defender for Office 365. Instead, the information is available in the regular reports and investigation features of Defender for Office 365 Plan 2. For more information, see [Reports for blocking mode](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#reports-for-blocking-mode).

The key factors that determine which modes are available to you are:

- Whether or not you currently have Defender for Office 365 (Plan 1 or Plan 2) as described in [Evaluation vs. trial for Defender for Office 365](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#evaluation-vs-trial-for-defender-for-office-365).
- How email is delivered to your Microsoft 365 organization as described in the following scenarios:

  - Mail from the internet flows directly Microsoft 365, but your current subscription has only [Exchange Online Protection (EOP)](eop-about.md) or [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](mdo-about.md#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet).

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-trial-mail-flow.png" alt-text="Mail flows from the internet into Microsoft 365, with protection from EOP and/or Defender for Office 365 Plan 1." lightbox="../../media/mdo-trial-mail-flow.png":::

    In these environments, **audit mode** or **blocking mode** are available, [depending on your licensing](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#evaluation-vs-trial-for-defender-for-office-365).

  - You're currently using a third-party service or device for email protection of your Microsoft 365 mailboxes. Mail from the internet flows through the protection service before delivery into your Microsoft 365 organization. Microsoft 365 protection is as low as possible (it's never completely off; for example, malware protection is always enforced).

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-migration-before.png" alt-text="Mail flows from the internet through the third-party protection service or device before delivery into Microsoft 365." lightbox="../../media/mdo-migration-before.png":::

    In these environments, only **audit mode** is available. You don't need to change your mail flow (MX records) to evaluate Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.

Let's get started!

## Blocking mode

### Step 1: Getting started in blocking mode

#### Start your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 trial

After you've initiated the trial and completed the [setup process](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#set-up-an-evaluation-or-trial-in-blocking-mode), it may take up to 2 hours for changes to take effect.

We've automatically enabled the [Standard preset security policy](preset-security-policies.md) in your environment. This profile represents a baseline protection profile that's suitable for most users. Standard protection includes:

- Safe Links, Safe Attachments and anti-phishing policies that are scoped to the entire tenant or subset of users you may have chosen during the trial setup process.
- Safe Attachments protection for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
- Safe Links protection for supported Office 365 apps.

#### Enable users to report suspicious content in blocking mode

Defender for Office 365 enables users to report messages to their security teams and allows admins to submit messages to Microsoft for analysis.

- Verify or configure [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) so reported messages go to a specified reporting mailbox, to Microsoft, or both.
- Deploy the [Report Message add-in or the Report Phishing add-in](submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure.md) for users to report messages. Or, users can use the built-in **Report** button in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA).
- Establish a workflow to [Report false positives and false negatives](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md).
- Use the **User reported** tab on the **Submissions** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user> to see and manage user reported messages.

Watch this video to learn more: [Learn how to use the Submissions page to submit messages for analysis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta5S09Yz6Ks&ab_channel=MicrosoftSecurit).

#### Review reports to understand the threat landscape in blocking mode

Use the reporting capabilities in Defender for Office 365 to get more details about your environment.

- Understand threats received in email and collaboration tools with the [Threat protection status report](reports-email-security.md#threat-protection-status-report).
- See where threats are blocked with the [Mailflow status report](reports-email-security.md#mailflow-status-report).
- Use the [URL protection report](reports-defender-for-office-365.md#url-protection-report) to review links that were viewed by users or blocked by the system.

### Step 2: Intermediate steps in blocking mode

#### Prioritize focus on your most targeted users

Protect your most targeted and most visible users with Priority Account Protection in Defender for Office 365, which helps you prioritize your workflow to ensure these users are safe.

- Identify your most targeted or most visible users.
- [Tag these users](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts#add-priority-accounts-from-the-microsoft-365-defender-page) as priority accounts.
- Track threats to priority accounts throughout the portal.

Watch this video to learn more: [Protecting priority accounts in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqnj0TlzQcI&list=PL3ZTgFEc7LystRja2GnDeUFqk44k7-KXf&index=11).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-trial-playbook-alerts.png" alt-text="The Alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/mdo-trial-playbook-alerts.png":::

### Avoid costly breaches by preventing user compromise

Get alerted to potential compromise and automatically limit the impact of these threats to prevent attackers from gaining deeper access to your environment.

- Review [compromised user alerts](address-compromised-users-quickly.md#compromised-user-alerts).
- [Investigate and respond](address-compromised-users-quickly.md) to compromised users.

## Auditing mode

### Step 1: Get started in auditing mode

#### Start your Defender for Office 365 evaluation

After you've completed the [setup process](try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#set-up-an-evaluation-or-trial-in-audit-mode), it may take up to 2 hours for changes to take effect. We've automatically configured Preset Evaluation policies in your environment.

Evaluation policies ensure no action is taken on email that's detected by Defender for Office 365.

#### Enable users to report suspicious content in auditing mode

Defender for Office 365 enables users to report messages to their security teams and allows admins to submit messages to Microsoft for analysis.

- Verify or configure [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md) so reported messages go to a specified reporting mailbox, to Microsoft, or both.
- Deploy the [Report Message add-in or the Report Phishing add-in](submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure.md) for users to report messages. Or, users can use the built-in **Report** button in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA).
- Establish a workflow to [Report false positives and false negatives](submissions-outlook-report-messages.md).
- Use the **User reported** tab on the **Submissions** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user> to see and manage user reported messages.
