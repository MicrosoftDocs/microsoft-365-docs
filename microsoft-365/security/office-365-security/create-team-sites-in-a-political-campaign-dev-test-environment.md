# Create team sites in a political campaign dev/test environment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**

- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

 **Summary:** Create public, private, sensitive, and highly confidential SharePoint Online team sites in your political campaign dev/test environment.

Use the instructions in this article to create a dev/test environment that includes the four different types of SharePoint Online team sites for the [Microsoft Security Guidance for Political Campaigns, Nonprofits, and Other Agile Organizations](microsoft-security-guidance-for-political-campaigns-nonprofits-and-other-agile-o.md) solution. These sites are described in detail on Topic 10, titled **SharePoint and OneDrive for Business**.

## Phase 1: Create your political campaign dev/test environment

First, follow the instructions in [Configure groups and users for a political campaign dev/test environment](configure-groups-and-users-for-a-political-campaign-dev-test-environment.md) to create your subscriptions, users, and groups.

## Phase 2: Create labels

In this phase, you create the labels for the different levels of security for SharePoint Online team site document folders.

1. If needed, sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center (<https://admin.microsoft.com>) with the credentials of the global administrator account of your trial subscription. For help, see [Where to sign in to Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4).

2. From the **Home** page where you start, click **Show all**. In the **Admin centers** section that appears, click **Compliance**.

3. From the **Home** page of the Microsoft 365 compliance center, go to the **Solutions** section \> **Information protection**. To go directly to the **Information protection** page, use <https://compliance.microsoft.com//informationprotection>.

4. On the **Information protection** page, verify that the **Label** tag is selected, and then click  ![Create a label icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create a label**.

5. The **New sensitivity label** wizard opens. On the **Name & description** step, enter the following values:
   - **Name**: Type **Internal**.

   - **Description for users**

   When you're finished, click **Next**.

6. On the **Label settings** pane, click **Next**.

8. Repeat steps 5-8 for these additional labels:

   - Private
   - Sensitive
   - Highly Confidential

9. From the **Home > Labels** pane, click **Publish labels**.

10. On the **Choose labels to publish** pane, click **Choose labels to publish**.
