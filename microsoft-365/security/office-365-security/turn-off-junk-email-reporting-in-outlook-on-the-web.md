# Turn off junk email reporting in Outlook on the web

You can send junk, phishing, and not junk messages to Microsoft for analysis using the Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) junk email reporting options, as described in [Report junk email and phishing scams in Outlook on the web](report-junk-email-and-phishing-scams-in-outlook-on-the-web-eop.md). If you don't want to use these options,admins can turn them off via the [Set-OwaMailboxPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/530166f7-ab42-4609-ba73-9b5a39b567be.aspx) cmdlet.

## Turn off junk, phishing, and not junk reporting to Microsoft
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

First, run the following command to get the names of your available Outlook on the web mailbox policies:
  
```
Get-OwaMailboxPolicy | Format-Table Name
```

Next, use the following syntax to enable or disable junk and not junk reporting to Microsoft in Outlook on the web:
  
```
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity "<OWAMailboxPolicyName>" -ReportJunkEmailEnabled <$true | $false>
```

This example turns off reporting in the default Outlook web app mailbox policy:
  
```
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity "OwaMailboxPolicy-Default" -ReportJunkEmailEnabled $false
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-OwaMailboxPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bdd580d3-8812-4b4a-93e8-c6401b0d2f0f.aspx) and [Set-OwaMailboxPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/530166f7-ab42-4609-ba73-9b5a39b567be.aspx).

## How do you know this worked?
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Run **Get-OWAMailboxPolicy** to check the parameter values, and then open Outlook on the web for an affected user (who has the Outlook on the web mailbox policy applied to them) and verify that the options to report junk, phishing, and not junk are not available. You'll still be able to mark messages as junk, phishing, and not junk, but you won't be able to report them.
