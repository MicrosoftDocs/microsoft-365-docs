# Roles and role groups in the Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Purview compliance portals

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

The [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender-portal) and [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) have replaced the Security & Compliance Center as the place to manage security and complinace-related roles and role groups for your organization. For more information about permissions within these portals, see the following articles:

- [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-security-center)
- [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions)

These portals let you grant permissions to people who perform tasks like device management, data loss prevention, eDiscovery, retention, and so on. These people can perform only the tasks that you explicitly grant them access to. To access these portals, users need to be a global admin or a member of one or more security or compliance role groups.

Permissions in these portals are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model. RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by Exchange, so if you're familiar with Exchange, granting permissions in these portals will be very similar. It's important to remember, however, that Exchange role groups and security and compliance role groups don't share membership or permissions. While both have an Organization Management role group, they aren't the same. The permissions they grant, and the members of the role groups, are different. This article contains the inventory of security and compliance roles and role groups.

## Role groups in the Defender and compliance portals

The following table lists the default role groups that are available in the Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Purview compliance portals, and the roles that are assigned to the role groups by default. To grant permissions to a user to perform a security or compliance task, add them to the appropriate role group.

Managing permissions in the portals only gives users access to the security and compliance features that are available within the portals. If you want to grant permissions to other security and compliance features that aren't in the portals, such as Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), you need to use the Exchange admin center (EAC). For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Permissions** tab in the portals, you need to be an admin. Specifically, you need to be assigned the **Role Management** role, and that role is assigned only to the **Organization Management** role group by default. Furthermore, the **Role Management** role allows users to view, create, and modify role groups.

|Role group|Description|Default roles assigned|

|**eDiscovery Manager**|Members can perform searches and place holds on mailboxes, SharePoint Online sites, and OneDrive for Business locations. Members can also create and manage eDiscovery cases, add and remove members to a case, create and edit Content Searches associated with a case, and access case data in eDiscovery (Premium). <br/><br/> An eDiscovery Administrator is a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group who has been assigned additional permissions. In addition to the tasks that an eDiscovery Manager can perform, an eDiscovery Administrator can:<ul><li>View all eDiscovery cases in the organization.</li><li>Manage any eDiscovery case after they add themselves as a member of the case.</li></ul> <br/><br/> The primary difference between an eDiscovery Manager and an eDiscovery Administrator is that an eDiscovery Administrator can access all cases that are listed on the **eDiscovery cases** page in the compliance portal. An eDiscovery manager can only access the cases they created or cases they are a member of. For more information about making a user an eDiscovery Administrator, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the compliance portal](../../compliance/assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).|Case Management <br/><br/> Communication <br/><br/> Compliance Search <br/><br/> Custodian <br/><br/> Export <br/><br/> Hold <br/><br/> Preview <br/><br/> Review <br/><br/> RMS Decrypt|

Members of this role group can see and open the list of cases on the **eDiscovery > Advanced** page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal that they're members of. After the user accesses an eDiscovery (Premium) case, they can select **Review sets** to access case data. This role doesn't allow the user to preview the results of a collection search that's associated with the case or do other search or case management tasks. Members of this role group can only access the data in a review set.|Review|
|**Security Administrator**|Members have access to a number of security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals. <p> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members. However, the Security Administrator role from Azure Active Directory is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Administrator role from Azure Active Directory. <p> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Azure Active Directory admin center. For more information, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). If you edit this role group in these portals (membership or roles), those changes apply only to the security and compliance areas and not to any other services. <p> This role group includes all of the read-only permissions of the Security reader role, plus a number of additional administrative permissions for the same services: Azure Information Protection, Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals.|Audit Logs <p><p> Device Management <p> DLP Compliance Management <p> IB Compliance Management <p> Manage Alerts <p> Quarantine <p> Security Administrator <p> Sensitivity Label Administrator <p> Tag Contributor <p> Tag Manager <p> Tag Reader <p> View-Only Audit Logs <p> View-Only Device Management <p> View-Only DLP Compliance Management <p> View-Only IB Compliance Management <p> View-Only Manage Alerts|

However, the Security Reader role from Azure Active Directory is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Reader role from Azure Active Directory. <p> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Azure Active Directory admin center.

|**Service Assurance User**|Members can access the Service assurance section in the compliance portal. Service assurance provides reports and documents that describe Microsoft's security practices for customer data that's stored in Microsoft 365. It also provides independent third-party audit reports on Microsoft 365.

|**Supervisory Review**|Members can create and manage the policies that define which communications are subject to review in an organization. For more information, see [Configure communication compliance policies for your organization](../../compliance/communication-compliance-configure.md).|Supervisory Review Administrator|

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> This role group doesn't assign members the permissions necessary to search the audit log or to use any reports that might include Exchange data, such as the DLP or Defender for Office 365 reports. To search the audit log or to view all reports, a user has to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online. This is because the underlying cmdlet used to search the audit log is an Exchange Online cmdlet. Global admins can search the audit log and view all reports because they're automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Search the audit log in the compliance portal](../../compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md).
