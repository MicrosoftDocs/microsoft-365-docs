# Roles and role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview compliance

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

The [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender-portal) and [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) have replaced the Security & Compliance Center as the place to manage Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview compliance roles and role groups for your organization. For more information about permissions within these portals, see the following articles:

- [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-portal-permissions)
- [Microsoft Purview solutions permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions)

These portals let you grant permissions to people who perform tasks like device management, data loss prevention, eDiscovery, retention, and so on. These people can perform only the tasks that you explicitly grant them access to. To access these portals, users need to be a global admin or a member of one or more Defender for Office 365 (Email & collaboration) or Purview compliance groups.

Permissions in these portals are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model. RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by Exchange, so if you're familiar with Exchange Online, granting permissions in these portals will be very similar. But, It's important to remember that role groups in Exchange Online and role groups for Defender for Office 365 or Purview compliance don't share membership or permissions. For example, while an Organization Management role group exists in Exchange Online, the permissions granted and role group members are different than the Organization Management role group in Defender for Office 365 and Purview compliance.

This article contains the inventory of Defender for Office 365 and Purview compliance roles and role groups.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Microsoft 365 Defender preview program, a different Microsoft Defender 365 RBAC model is also available. The permissions in this RBAC model are different from the Defender for Office 365 permissions as described in this article. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Defender role-based access control (RBAC)](../defender/manage-rbac.md).

## Role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview compliance

The table in this section lists the default role groups that are available in the Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Purview compliance portals, and the roles that are assigned to the role groups by default. To grant permissions to a user to perform taks in Defender for Office 365 or Purview compliance, add them to the appropriate role group.

Managing permissions in Defender for Office 365 or Purview compliance gives users access to security and compliance features that are available within their respective portals. To grant permissions to other features, such as Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), you need to grant permissions in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Permissions** tab as described in this article, you need to be an admin. Specifically, you need to be assigned the **Role Management** role, and that role is assigned only to the **Organization Management** role group by default. The **Role Management** role also allows you to view, create, and modify role groups.

|**eDiscovery Manager**|Members can perform searches and place holds on mailboxes, SharePoint Online sites, and OneDrive for Business locations. Members can also create and manage eDiscovery cases, add and remove members to a case, create and edit Content Searches associated with a case, and access case data in eDiscovery (Premium). <br/><br/> An eDiscovery Administrator is a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group who has been assigned additional permissions. In addition to the tasks that an eDiscovery Manager can perform, an eDiscovery Administrator can:<ul><li>View all eDiscovery cases in the organization.</li><li>Manage any eDiscovery case after they add themselves as a member of the case.</li></ul> <br/><br/> The primary difference between an eDiscovery Manager and an eDiscovery Administrator is that an eDiscovery Administrator can access all cases that are listed on the **eDiscovery cases** page in the compliance portal. An eDiscovery manager can only access the cases they created or cases they are a member of. For more information about making a user an eDiscovery Administrator, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the compliance portal](../../compliance/assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).|Case Management <br/><br/> Communication <br/><br/> Compliance Search <br/><br/> Custodian <br/><br/> Export <br/><br/> Hold <br/><br/> Manage Review Set Tags <br/><br/> Preview <br/><br/> Review <br/><br/> RMS Decrypt <br/><br/> Scope Manager|

|**Organization Management**<sup>1</sup>|Members can control permissions for accessing features in these portals, and also manage settings for device management, data loss prevention, reports, and preservation. <br/><br/> Users who are not global administrators must be Exchange administrators to see and take action on devices that are managed by Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Mobile Device Management or MDM). <br/><br/> Global admins are automatically added as members of this role group, but you won't see them in the output of the [Get-RoleGroupMember](/powershell/module/exchange/get-rolegroupmember) cmdlet in [Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/module/exchange/get-rolegroupmember).|Audit Logs <br/><br/> Case Management <br/><br/> Communication Compliance Admin <br/><br/> Communication Compliance Case Management <br/><br/> Compliance Administrator <br/><br/> Compliance Manager Administration <br/><br/> Compliance Search <br/><br/> Data Connector Admin <br/><br/> Device Management <br/><br/> DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> Hold <br/><br/> IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Admin <br/><br/> Manage Alerts <br/><br/> Organization Configuration <br/><br/> Quarantine <br/><br/> RecordManagement <br/><br/> Retention Management <br/><br/> Role Management <br/><br/> Scope Manager <br/><br/> Search And Purge <br/><br/> Security Administrator <br/><br/> Security Reader <br/><br/> Sensitivity Label Administrator <br/><br/> Sensitivity Label Reader <br/><br/> Service Assurance View <br/><br/> Tag Contributor <br/><br/> Tag Manager <br/><br/> Tag Reader <br/><br/> View-Only Audit Logs <br/><br/> View-Only Case <br/><br/> View-Only Device Management <br/><br/> View-Only DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only Manage Alerts <br/><br/> View-Only Recipients <br/><br/> View-Only Record Management <br/><br/> View-Only Retention Management|

Members of this role group can only access the data in a review set.|Review|
|**Security Administrator**|Members have access to a number of security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals. <br/><br/> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members. However, the Security Administrator role from Azure Active Directory is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Administrator role from Azure Active Directory. <br/><br/> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Azure Active Directory admin center. For more information, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). If you edit this role group in these portals (membership or roles), those changes apply only to the security and compliance areas and not to any other services. <br/><br/> This role group includes all of the read-only permissions of the Security reader role, plus a number of additional administrative permissions for the same services: Azure Information Protection, Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals.|Audit Logs <br/><br/> Compliance Manager Administration <br/><br/> Device Management <br/><br/> DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> Manage Alerts <br/><br/> Quarantine <br/><br/> Security Administrator <br/><br/> Sensitivity Label Administrator <br/><br/> Tag Contributor <br/><br/> Tag Manager <br/><br/> Tag Reader <br/><br/> View-Only Audit Logs <br/><br/> View-Only Device Management <br/><br/> View-Only DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only Manage Alerts|

|**Security Reader**|Members have read-only access to a number of security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals. <br/><br/> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members. However, the Security Reader role from Azure Active Directory is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Reader role from Azure Active Directory. <br/><br/> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Azure Active Directory admin center. For more information, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

|**Service Assurance User**|Members can access the Service assurance section in the compliance portal. Service assurance provides reports and documents that describe Microsoft's security practices for customer data that's stored in Microsoft 365. It also provides independent third-party audit reports on Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Service assurance in the compliance portal](../../compliance/service-assurance.md).|Service Assurance View|

For more information, see [Configure communication compliance policies for your organization](../../compliance/communication-compliance-configure.md).|Supervisory Review Administrator|

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> This role group doesn't assign members the permissions necessary to search the audit log or to use any reports that might include Exchange data, such as the DLP or Defender for Office 365 reports. To search the audit log or to view all reports, a user has to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online. This action is required because the underlying cmdlet that's used to search the audit log is an Exchange Online cmdlet. Global admins can search the audit log and view all reports because they're automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Search the audit log in the compliance portal](../../compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md).
