# Roles and role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

The [Microsoft Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender-portal), [Microsoft Purview portal](/purview/purview-portal), and the classic Microsoft Purview [compliance](/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center) and [governance](/purview/use-microsoft-purview-governance-portal) portals have replaced the Security & Compliance Center as the places to manage Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview roles and role groups for your organization. For more information about permissions within these portals, see the following articles:

- [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-portal-permissions)
- [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview portal](/purview/purview-portal)
- [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions)
- [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview governance portal](/purview/roles-permissions)

These portals let you grant permissions to people who perform tasks like device management, data loss prevention, eDiscovery, retention, and so on. These people can perform only the tasks that you explicitly grant them access to. To access these portals, users need to be a global admin or a member of one or more role groups in Defender for Office 365 (**Email & collaboration** role groups) or Purview (**Microsoft Purview solutions** role groups). The [Microsoft Purview portal (preview)](/purview/purview-portal) provides access to data governance, data security, and risk and compliance solutions. Selecting risk and compliance solutions in the portal currently opens these solutions in the classic [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com).

Permissions in these portals are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model. RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by Exchange, so if you're familiar with Exchange Online, granting permissions in these portals is very similar. But, It's important to remember that role groups in Exchange Online and role groups for Defender for Office 365 or Purview compliance don't share membership or permissions. For example, while an Organization Management role group exists in Exchange Online, the permissions granted and role group members are different than the Organization Management role group in Defender for Office 365 and Purview compliance.

This article contains the inventory of Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview roles and role groups.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Microsoft Defender XDR preview program, a different Microsoft Defender 365 RBAC model is also available. The permissions in this RBAC model are different from the Defender for Office 365 permissions as described in this article. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender XDR role-based access control (RBAC)](../defender/manage-rbac.md).

## Role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview

The table in this section lists the default role groups that are available in the Microsoft Defender portal and the Microsoft Purview portals, and the roles that are assigned to the role groups by default. To grant permissions to a user to perform tasks in Defender for Office 365 or Microsoft Purview, add them to the appropriate role group.

Managing permissions in Defender for Office 365 or Microsoft Purview gives users access to security and compliance and governance features that are available within their respective portals. To grant permissions to other features, such as Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), you need to grant permissions in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Permissions** tab as described in this article, you need to be an admin. Specifically, you need to be assigned the **Role Management** role, and that role is assigned only to the **Organization Management** and **Purview Administrators** role groups by default. The **Role Management** role also allows you to view, create, and modify role groups.

By adding all user accounts for designated administrators, analysts, and investigators, you can configure insider risk management permissions in a single group. This role group contains all the insider risk management permission roles. This role group is the easiest way to quickly get started with insider risk management and is a good fit for organizations that don't need separate permissions defined for separate groups of users.|Case Management <br/><br/> Custodian <br/><br/> Data Connector Admin <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Admin <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Analysis <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Approval <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Audit <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Investigation <br/><br/> Insider Risk Management Sessions <br/><br/> Review <br/><br/> View-Only Case|

Members of this role group can see and open the list of cases on the **eDiscovery \> Advanced** page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal that they're members of. After the user accesses an eDiscovery (Premium) case, they can select **Review sets** to access case data. This role doesn't allow the user to preview the results of a collection search that's associated with the case or do other search or case management tasks. Members of this role group can only access the data in a review set.|Review|
|**Security Administrator**|Members have access to many security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals. <br/><br/> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members. However, the Security Administrator role from Microsoft Entra ID is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Administrator role from Microsoft Entra ID. <br/><br/> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference). If you edit this role group in these portals (membership or roles), those changes apply only to the security and compliance areas and not to any other services. <br/><br/> This role group includes all of the read-only permissions of the Security reader role, plus many additional administrative permissions for the same services: Azure Information Protection, Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals.|Audit Logs <br/><br/> Compliance Manager Administration <br/><br/> Device Management <br/><br/> DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> Manage Alerts <br/><br/> Quarantine <br/><br/> Security Administrator <br/><br/> Sensitivity Label Administrator <br/><br/> Tag Contributor <br/><br/> Tag Manager <br/><br/> Tag Reader <br/><br/> View-Only Audit Logs <br/><br/> View-Only Device Management <br/><br/> View-Only DLP Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only IB Compliance Management <br/><br/> View-Only Manage Alerts|

|**Security Reader**|Members have read-only access to many security features of Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health, and the Defender and compliance portals. <br/><br/> By default, this role group may not appear to have any members. However, the Security Reader role from Microsoft Entra ID is assigned to this role group. Therefore, this role group inherits the capabilities and membership of the Security Reader role from Microsoft Entra ID. <br/><br/> To manage permissions centrally, add and remove group members in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

|**Service Assurance User**|Members can access the Service assurance section in the compliance portal. Service assurance provides reports and documents that describe Microsoft's security practices for customer data that's stored in Microsoft 365. It also provides independent third-party audit reports on Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Service assurance in the compliance portal](/purview/service-assurance).|Service Assurance View|

For more information, see [Configure communication compliance policies for your organization](/purview/communication-compliance-configure).|Supervisory Review Administrator|

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> This role group doesn't assign members the permissions necessary to search the audit log or to use any reports that might include Exchange data, such as the DLP or Defender for Office 365 reports. To search the audit log or to view all reports, a user has to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online. This action is required because the underlying cmdlet that's used to search the audit log is an Exchange Online cmdlet. Global admins can search the audit log and view all reports because they're automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Search the audit log in the compliance portal](/purview/audit-log-search).
