# Office 365 ATP Safe Links warning pages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is intended for business customers who have [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md). If you are using Outlook.com, Office 365 Home, or Office 365 Personal, and you're looking for information about Safe Links in Outlook, see [Advanced Outlook.com security](https://support.office.com/article/882d2243-eab9-4545-a58a-b36fee4a46e2).

[Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md) (ATP) helps protect your organization from phishing attempts and malware through features, such as [ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md), [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), and [anti-phishing protection](anti-phishing-protection.md). When protection is in place, links (URLs) in email messages and Office documents are checked. If a URL is identified as suspicious or malicious, you might be blocked from opening the URL when you click it. Instead of going directly to the site, you might see a warning page instead. 
  
Read this article to see examples of warning pages that might appear, along with recent updates to warning pages.
