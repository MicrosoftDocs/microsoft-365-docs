# Review and manage remediation actions in Office 365

As automated investigations on email & collaboration content result in verdicts, such as *Malicious* or *Suspicious*, certain remediation actions are created. In Microsoft Defender for Office 365, remediation actions can include:
- Blocking a URL (time-of-click)
- Soft deleting email messages or clusters
- Quarantining email or email attachments
- Turning off external mail forwarding

These remediation actions are not taken unless and until your security operations team approves them. We recommend reviewing and approving any pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations complete in a timely manner. In some cases, you can undo a remediation action.

**Applies to**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

## Approve (or reject) pending actions

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 security center (<https://security.microsoft.com>) and sign in.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Action center**.
3. On the **Pending** tab, review the list of actions that are awaiting approval.
4. Select an item in the list. Its flyout pane opens. 
5. Review the information in the flyout pane, and then take one of the following steps:
   - Select **Open investigation page** to view more details about the investigation.
   - Select **Approve** to initiate a pending action.
   - Select **Reject** to prevent a pending action from being taken.

## Undo one remediation action

## Undo multiple remediation actions

1. Go to the Action center (<https://security.microsoft.com/action-center>) and sign in.
