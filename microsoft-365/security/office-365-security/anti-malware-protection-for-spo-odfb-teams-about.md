# Built-in virus protection in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Microsoft 365 uses a common virus detection engine for scanning files that users upload to SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams. This protection is included with all subscriptions that include SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The built-in anti-virus capabilities are a way to help contain viruses. They aren't intended as a single point of defense against malware for your environment. We encourage all customers to investigate and implement anti-malware protection at various layers and apply best practices for securing their enterprise infrastructure.

## What happens if an infected file is uploaded to SharePoint Online?

The Microsoft 365 virus detection engine scans files asynchronously (at some time after upload). If a file has not yet been scanned by the asynchronous virus detection process, and a user tries to download the file from the browser or from Teams, a scan on download is triggered by SharePoint before the download is allowed. **All file types are not automatically scanned**. Heuristics determine the files to scan. When a file is found to contain a virus, the file is flagged.

Here's what happens:

1. A user uploads a file to SharePoint Online.
2. SharePoint Online, as part of its virus scanning processes, later determines if the file meets the criteria for a scan.
3. If the file meets the criteria for a scan, the virus detection engine scans the file.
4. If a virus is found within the scanned file, the virus engine sets a property on the file that indicates the file is infected.

## What happens when a user tries to download an infected file by using the browser?

By default, users can download infected files from SharePoint Online. Here's what happens:

1. In a web browser, a user tries to download a file from SharePoint Online that happens to be infected.
2. The user is shown a warning that a virus has been detected in the file. The user is given the option to proceed with the download and attempt to clean it using anti-virus software on their device.

To change this behavior so users can't download infected files, even from the anti-virus warning window, admins can use the *DisallowInfectedFileDownload* parameter on the **[Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant)** cmdlet in SharePoint Online PowerShell. The value $true for the *DisallowInfectedFileDownload* parameter completely blocks access to detected/blocked files for users.

For instructions, see [Use SharePoint Online PowerShell to prevent users from downloading malicious files](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-configure.md#step-2-recommended-use-sharepoint-online-powershell-to-prevent-users-from-downloading-malicious-files).

## Can admins bypass *DisallowInfectedFileDownload* and extract infected files?

SharePoint admins and global admins are allowed to do forensic file extractions of malware-infected files in SharePoint Online PowerShell with the [Get-SPOMalwareFileContent](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spomalwarefilecontent) cmdlet. Admins don't need access to the site that hosts the infected content. As long as the file has been marked as malware, admins can use **Get-SPOMalwareFileContent** to extract the file.

For more information about the infected file, admins can use the **[Get-SPOMalwareFile](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spomalwarefile)** cmdlet to see the type of malware that was detected and the status of the infection.

## What happens when the OneDrive sync client tries to sync an infected file?

When a malicious file is uploaded to OneDrive, it will be synced to the local machine before it's marked as malware. After it's marked as malware, the user can't open the synced file anymore from their local machine.

## Extended capabilities with Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Microsoft 365 organizations that have [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](defender-for-office-365.md) included in their subscription or purchased as an add-on can enable Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams for enhanced reporting and protection. For more information, see [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md).
