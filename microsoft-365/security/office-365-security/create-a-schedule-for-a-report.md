# Create a schedule for a report in the Security &amp; Compliance Center

In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, several [reports and insights](reports-and-insights-in-security-and-compliance.md) are available to help your organization's security team mitigate and address threats to your organization. If you're a member of your organization's security team, you can create a schedule for a report. The schedule you create can include a custom date ranges to suit your organization. 
  
## Create a schedule for a report

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this task. In general, global administrators, security administrators, and security readers can access reports in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. To learn more about permissions, see [Permissions in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).
  
1. In the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard**.
    
2. Choose one of the following reports: 

    - DLP policy matches
    - Exchange Transport Rule
    - DLP false positives and overrides
    - Office 365 ATP file types
    - Office 365 ATP message disposition
    - Malware detected in email
    - Top malware
    - Top senders and recipients
    - Spoof detections
    - Spam detections
    - Sent and received email
    - DLP incidents
    - Encryption report

    For this example, we'll choose the Advanced Threat Protection File Types report.
    
3. In the upper left corner of the report, choose **+ Create schedule**. 
    
    ![Create schedule](../../media/atpfiletypes-createschedule.png)

    (NOTE: Not all reports have the **+ Create schedule** button.)
  
    The **Create schedule** dialog box opens. 
    
4. Keep the default settings and choose **Create schedule**, or choose **Customize schedule**.
    
    ![You can use the default settings or customize a report schedule](../../media/04fac327-8f73-4711-8319-58c11880fd96.png)
  
    If you choose to customize your report schedule, you can specify the report's frequency, a sender's email address, and a recipient's email address. 
    
Once you have created a schedule for a report, that report will be delivered via email to recipients' email addresses automatically.
