# Report junk email and phishing scams in Outlook on the web

It can be frustrating when users in your organization receive junk email or miss an important email because it was misidentified as spam. We're constantly fine-tuning the Exchange Online Protection (EOP) spam filters to be more accurate, and you and your end users can help with this process; Microsoft Outlook on the web users can report junk (spam) and phishing scams by using built-in email reporting options. You can also let Microsoft know if an email was incorrectly identified as junk (spam).

## Submit junk messages in Outlook on the web

To submit a junk mail message to Microsoft:

1. Click on the junk message and then click **Junk** on the toolbar. This moves the message to your Junk email folder and adds the sender to your blocked sender list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Alternatively, right-click a message to display a menu, and click **Mark as junk**.

   You can report a junk message from your **Inbox**, **Clutter**, or **Deleted Items** folder.

2. A dialog box opens asking if you want to send a copy of the junk email message to Microsoft for analysis. Click **report** to send the message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis Team. Optionally, select the **Don't show me this message again** check box if you want to automatically submit future junk messages to Microsoft without being prompted.

   > [!TIP]
   > Even if you select the **Don't show me this message again** check box, you can later change your preferences for reporting junk email by accessing the display settings in Outlook on the web. (You can access these settings through the gear menu next to your sign in name.)

## Submit phishing scam messages in Outlook on the web

To submit a phishing scam message to Microsoft:

1. Click on the phishing scam message, click the down arrow next to **Junk**, and then click **Phishing** on the toolbar. Office 365 does not block the sender because senders of phishing scam messages typically impersonate legitimate senders. If you prefer, add the sender to your blocked senders list by following the instructions in the topic [Filter junk email and spam in Outlook on the web](https://support.office.com/article/db786e79-54e2-40cc-904f-d89d57b7f41d).

   You can report a phishing scam message from your **Inbox**, **Clutter**, or **Deleted Items** folder.

This reporting option is currently available to a limited number of organizations; you might not be asked to report a phishing scam to Microsoft.

## Submit "not junk" messages in Outlook on the web

When a message is incorrectly identified as junk by Office 365, submit a message as "not junk" to Microsoft:
