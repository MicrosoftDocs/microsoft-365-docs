# User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

User tags are identifiers for specific groups of users in [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](defender-for-office-365.md). There are two types of user tags:

- **System tags**: Currently, [Priority accounts](../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md) is the only type of system tag.
- **Custom tags**: You create these user tags yourself.

If your organization has Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 (included in your subscription or as an add-on), you can create custom user tags in addition to using the priority accounts tag.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can only apply user tags to mailbox users.

After you apply system tags or custom tags to users, you can use those tags as filters in alerts, reports, and investigations:

- [Alerts](alerts.md)
- [Custom alert policies](../../compliance/alert-policies.md#viewing-alerts)
- [Threat Explorer and real-time detections](threat-explorer.md)
- [Compromised user report](view-email-security-reports.md#compromised-users-report)
- [Email entity page](mdo-email-entity-page.md#other-innovations)
- [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report)
- [Top senders and recipients report](view-email-security-reports.md#top-senders-and-recipients-report)
- [Attack simulation](attack-simulation-training.md#target-users)
- [Campaign Views](campaigns.md)
- [Admin and user submissions](admin-submission.md)
- [Quarantine](quarantine.md)
- For priority accounts, you can use the [Email issues for priority accounts report](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-email-issues-for-priority-accounts-report) in the Exchange admin center (EAC).

This article explains how to configure user tags in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. There are no cmdlets in Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage user tags.

To see how user tags are part of the strategy to help protect high-impact user accounts, see [Security recommendations for priority accounts in Microsoft 365](security-recommendations-for-priority-accounts.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **User tags** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userTags>.

- You need to be assigned permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal before you can do the procedures in this article:
  - To create, modify, and delete custom user tags, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
  - To add and remove members from the Priority Account system tag, you need to be a member of the **Security Administrator** and **Exchange Admin** role groups.
  - To add and remove members from existing custom user tags, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
  - For read-only access to user tags, you need to be a member of the **Global Reader**, **Security Operator**, or **Security Reader** role groups.

  For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  >
  > - User tag management is controlled by the **Tag Reader** and **Tag Manager** roles.

- You can also manage and monitor priority accounts in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For instructions, see [Manage and monitor priority accounts](../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md).

- For information about securing _privileged accounts_ (admin accounts), see [this topic](/security/compass/critical-impact-accounts).
