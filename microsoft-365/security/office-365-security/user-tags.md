# User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

> [!NOTE]
> The user tags feature is in Preview, isn't available to everyone, and is subject to change. For information about the release schedule, check out the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap).

User tags are identifiers for specific groups of users in [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](office-365-atp.md). There are two types of user tags:

- **System tags**: Currently, [Priority accounts](../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md) is the only type of system tag.
- **Custom tags**: You create these user tags yourself.

If your organization has Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 (included in your subscription or as an add-on), you can create custom user tags in addition to using the priority accounts tag.

After you apply system tags or custom tags to users, you can use those tags as filters in alerts, reports, and investigations:

- [Alerts in the Security & Compliance Center](alerts.md)
- [Threat Explorer and real-time detections](threat-explorer.md)
- [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report)
- [Campaign Views](campaigns.md)
- For priority accounts, you can use the [Email issues for priority accounts report](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-email-issues-for-priority-accounts-report) in the Exchange admin center (EAC).

This article explains how to configure user tags in the Security & Compliance Center. There are no cmdlets in Security & Compliance Center to manage user tags.

To see how user tags are part of the strategy to help protect high-impact user accounts, see [Security recommendations for priority accounts in Microsoft 365](security-recommendations-for-priority-accounts.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Security & Compliance Center at <https://protection.office.com/>. To go directly to the **User tags** page, open <https://protection.office.com/userTags>.

- You need to be assigned permissions in the Security & Compliance Center before you can do the procedures in this article:
  - To create, modify, and delete user tags, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
  - To add and remove members from existing user tags, you need to be a member of the **Organization Management**, **Security Administrator**, or **Security Operator** role groups
  - For read-only access to user tags, you need to be a member of the **Global Reader** or **Security Reader** role groups.

  For more information, see [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

  **Notes**:

  - Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions in the Security & Compliance Center _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  - User tag management is controlled by the **Tag Reader** and **Tag Manager** roles.

- You can also manage and monitor priority accounts in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For instructions, see [Manage and monitor priority accounts](../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md).
