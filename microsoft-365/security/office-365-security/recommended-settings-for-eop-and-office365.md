# Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for Microsoft 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes. But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are often required. **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** Plan 1 or Plan 2 contain additional features that give admins more layers of security, control, and investigation.

Although we empower security administrators to customize their security settings, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: **Standard** and **Strict**. Although customer environments and needs are different, these levels of filtering will help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees' Inbox in most situations.

To automatically apply the Standard or Strict settings to users, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

This article describes the default settings, and also the recommended Standard and Strict settings to help protect your users. The tables contain the settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

> [!NOTE]
> The Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA) module for PowerShell can help you (admins) find the current values of these settings. Specifically, the **Get-ORCAReport** cmdlet generates an assessment of anti-spam, anti-phishing, and other message hygiene settings. You can download the ORCA module at <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/>.
>
> In Microsoft 365 organizations, we recommend that you leave the Junk Email Filter in Outlook set to **No automatic filtering** to prevent unnecessary conflicts (both positive and negative) with the spam filtering verdicts from EOP. For more information, see the following articles:
>
> - [Configure junk email settings on Exchange Online mailboxes](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md)
> - [About junk email settings in Outlook](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md#about-junk-email-settings-in-outlook)
> - [Change the level of protection in the Junk Email Filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b)

## Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection in EOP

Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing are EOP features that can be configured by admins. We recommend the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### EOP anti-spam policy settings

To create and configure anti-spam policies, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

|Security feature name|Default|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Bulk email threshold & spam properties**|||||
|**Bulk email threshold** <br/><br/> _BulkThreshold_|7|6|4|For details, see [Bulk complaint level (BCL) in EOP](bulk-complaint-level-values.md).|
|_MarkAsSpamBulkMail_|`On`|`On`|`On`|This setting is only available in PowerShell.|
|**Increase spam score** settings|Off|Off|Off|All of these settings are part of the Advanced Spam Filter (ASF). For more information, see the [ASF settings in anti-spam policies](#asf-settings-in-anti-spam-policies) section in this article.|
|**Mark as spam** settings|Off|Off|Off|Most of these settings are part of ASF. For more information, see the [ASF settings in anti-spam policies](#asf-settings-in-anti-spam-policies) section in this article.|
|**Contains specific languages** <br/><br/> _EnableLanguageBlockList_ <br/><br/> _LanguageBlockList_|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|We have no specific recommendation for this setting. You can block messages in specific languages based on your business needs.|
|**From these countries** <br/><br/> _EnableRegionBlockList_ <br/><br/> _RegionBlockList_|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|**Off** <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|We have no specific recommendation for this setting. You can block messages from specific countries based on your business needs.|
|**Test mode** (_TestModeAction_)|**None**|**None**|**None**|This setting is part of ASF. For more information, see the [ASF settings in anti-spam policies](#asf-settings-in-anti-spam-policies) section in this article.|
|**Actions**||||Wherever you select **Quarantine message**, a **Select quarantine policy** box is available. Quarantine policies define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages. <br/><br/> Standard and Strict preset security policies use the default quarantine policies (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy or DefaultFullAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications) as described in the table [here](quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features). <br/><br/> When you create a new anti-spam policy, a blank value means the default quarantine policy is used to define the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined by that particular verdict (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications for **High confidence phishing**; DefaultFullAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications for everything else). <br/><br/> Admins can create and select custom quarantine policies that define more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities for users in the default or custom anti-spam policies. For more information, see [Quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md).|
|**Spam** detection action <br/><br/> _SpamAction_|**Move message to Junk Email folder** <br/><br/> `MoveToJmf`|**Move message to Junk Email folder** <br/><br/> `MoveToJmf`|**Quarantine message** <br/><br/> `Quarantine`||

The default value is **Quarantine message** in new anti-spam policies that you create in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.|
|**High confidence phishing** detection action <br/><br/> _HighConfidencePhishAction_|**Quarantine message** <br/><br/> `Quarantine`|**Quarantine message** <br/><br/> `Quarantine`|**Quarantine message** <br/><br/> `Quarantine`||

|**Retain spam in quarantine for this many days** <br/><br/> _QuarantineRetentionPeriod_|15 days<sup>\*</sup>|30 days|30 days|<sup>\*</sup> The default value is 15 days in the default anti-spam policy and in new anti-spam policies that you create in PowerShell. The default value is 30 days in new anti-spam policies that you create in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. <br/><br/> This value also affects messages that are quarantined by anti-phishing policies. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP](quarantine-email-messages.md).|
|**Enable spam safety tips** <br/><br/> _InlineSafetyTipsEnabled_|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`||

|Enable ZAP for spam messages <br/><br/> _SpamZapEnabled_|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`|Selected <br/><br/> `$true`||
|**Allow & block list**|||||
|Allowed senders <br/><br/> _AllowedSenders_|None|None|None||
|Allowed sender domains <br/><br/> _AllowedSenderDomains_|None|None|None|Adding domains to the allowed senders list is a very bad idea. Attackers would be able to send you email that would otherwise be filtered out. <br/><br/> Use the [spoof intelligence insight](learn-about-spoof-intelligence.md) and the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list.md) to review all senders who are spoofing sender email addresses in your organization's email domains or spoofing sender email addresses in external domains.|

|**Sender ID filtering hard fail** (_MarkAsSpamFromAddressAuthFail_)||
|**Backscatter** (_MarkAsSpamNdrBackscatter_)||
|**Test mode** (_TestModeAction_)|For ASF settings that support **Test** as an action, you can configure the test mode action to **None**, **Add default X-Header text**, or **Send Bcc message** (`None`, `AddXHeader`, or `BccMessage`). For more information, see [Enable, disable, or test ASF settings](advanced-spam-filtering-asf-options.md#enable-disable-or-test-asf-settings).|

#### EOP outbound spam policy settings

To create and configure outbound spam policies, see [Configure outbound spam filtering in EOP](configure-the-outbound-spam-policy.md).

For more information about the default sending limits in the service, see [Sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits-1).

> [!NOTE]
> Outbound spam policies are not part of Standard or Strict preset security policies. The **Standard** and **Strict** values indicate our **recommended** values in the default outbound spam policy or custom outbound spam policies that you create.

|Security feature name|Default|Recommended<br/>Standard|Recommended<br/>Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Set an external message limit** <br/><br/> _RecipientLimitExternalPerHour_|0|500|400|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Set an internal message limit** <br/><br/> _RecipientLimitInternalPerHour_|0|1000|800|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Set a daily message limit** <br/><br/> _RecipientLimitPerDay_|0|1000|800|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Restriction placed on users who reach the message limit** <br/><br/> _ActionWhenThresholdReached_|**Restrict the user from sending mail until the following day** <br/><br/> `BlockUserForToday`|**Restrict the user from sending mail** <br/><br/> `BlockUser`|**Restrict the user from sending mail** <br/><br/> `BlockUser`||

It doesn't work in custom outbound spam policies that you create.|
|**Notify these users and groups if a sender is blocked due to sending outbound spam** <br/><br/> _NotifyOutboundSpam_ <br/><br/> _NotifyOutboundSpamRecipients_|Not selected <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|Not selected <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|Not selected <br/><br/> `$false` <br/><br/> Blank|The default [alert policy](../../compliance/alert-policies.md) named **User restricted from sending email** already sends email notifications to members of the **TenantAdmins** (**Global admins**) group when users are blocked due to exceeding the limits in policy. **We strongly recommend that you use the alert policy rather than this setting in the outbound spam policy to notify admins and other users**. For instructions, see [Verify the alert settings for restricted users](removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam.md#verify-the-alert-settings-for-restricted-users).|

### EOP anti-malware policy settings

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

Additional security benefits come with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 subscription. For the latest news and information, you can see [What's new in Defender for Office 365](whats-new-in-defender-for-office-365.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The default anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides [spoof protection](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#spoof-settings) and mailbox intelligence for all recipients. However, the other available [impersonation protection](#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) features and [advanced settings](#advanced-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) are not configured or enabled in the default policy. To enable all protection features, modify the default anti-phishing policy or create additional anti-phishing policies.
>
> - Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy or Safe Links policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection and Safe Links protection to all recipients (users who aren't defined in custom Safe Attachments policies or Safe Links policies). For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).
>
> - [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) protection and [Safe Documents](safe-docs.md) protection have no dependencies on Safe Links policies.

If your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or if you've purchased Defender for Office 365 as an add-on, set the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

EOP customers get basic anti-phishing as previously described, but Defender for Office 365 includes more features and control to help prevent, detect, and remediate against attacks. To create and configure these policies, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.md).

#### Advanced settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about this setting, see [Advanced phishing thresholds in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#advanced-phishing-thresholds-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). To configure this setting, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.md).

|Security feature name|Default|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Phishing email threshold** <br/><br/> _PhishThresholdLevel_|**1 - Standard** <br/><br/> `1`|**2 - Aggressive** <br/><br/> `2`|**3 - More aggressive** <br/><br/> `3`||

#### Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about these settings, see [Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

#### EOP anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

These are the same settings that are available in [anti-spam policy settings in EOP](#eop-anti-spam-policy-settings).

### Safe Attachments settings

Safe Attachments in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes global settings that have no relationship to Safe Attachments policies, and settings that are specific to each Safe Links policy. For more information, see [Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365](safe-attachments.md).

Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection to all recipients (users who aren't defined in custom Safe Attachments policies). For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

#### Global settings for Safe Attachments

> [!NOTE]
> The global settings for Safe Attachments are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, but not by the **Standard** or **Strict** preset security policies. Either way, admins can modify these global Safe Attachments settings at any time.
>
> The **Default** column shows the values before the existence of the **Built-in protection** preset security policy. The **Built-in protection** column shows the values that are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, which are also our recommended values.

To configure these settings, see [Turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](turn-on-mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) and [Safe Documents in Microsoft 365 E5](safe-docs.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [Set-AtpPolicyForO365](/powershell/module/exchange/set-atppolicyforo365) cmdlet for these settings.

#### Safe Attachments policy settings

To configure these settings, see [Set up Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365](set-up-safe-attachments-policies.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [New-SafeAttachmentPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-safeattachmentpolicy) and [Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-safelinkspolicy) cmdlets for these settings.

> [!NOTE]
> As described earlier, there is no default Safe Attachments policy, but Safe Attachments protection is assigned to all recipients by the [**Built-in protection** preset security policy](preset-security-policies.md).
>
> The **Default in custom** column refers to the default values in new Safe Attachments policies that you create. The remaining columns indicate (unless otherwise noted) the values that are configured in the corresponding preset security policies.
