# Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for Microsoft 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes. But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are often required. **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** Plan 1 or Plan 2 contain additional features that give more layers of security, control, and investigation.

Although we empower security administrators to customize their security settings, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: **Standard** and **Strict**. Although customer environments and needs are different, these levels of filtering help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees' Inbox in most situations.

To automatically apply the Standard or Strict settings to users, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

This article describes the default settings, and also the recommended Standard and Strict settings to help protect your users. The tables contain the settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

> [!NOTE]
> The Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA) module for PowerShell can help admins find the current values of these settings. Specifically, the **Get-ORCAReport** cmdlet generates an assessment of anti-spam, anti-phishing, and other message hygiene settings. You can download the ORCA module at <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/>.
>
> In Microsoft 365 organizations, we recommend that you leave the Junk Email Filter in Outlook set to **No automatic filtering** to prevent unnecessary conflicts (both positive and negative) with the spam filtering verdicts from EOP. For more information, see the following articles:
>
> - [Configure junk email settings on Exchange Online mailboxes](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md)
> - [About junk email settings in Outlook](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md#about-junk-email-settings-in-outlook)
> - [Change the level of protection in the Junk Email Filter](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b)

## Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection in EOP

Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing are EOP features that can be configured by admins. We recommend the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### EOP anti-malware policy settings

To create and configure anti-malware policies, see [Configure anti-malware policies in EOP](anti-malware-policies-configure.md).

Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

The policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as malware as described in the table [here](quarantine-end-user.md).

Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware messages.

|Security feature name|Default|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Protection settings**|||||
|**Enable the common attachments filter** (_EnableFileFilter_)|Selected (`$true`)<sup>\*</sup>|Selected (`$true`)|Selected (`$true`)|For the list of file types in the common attachments filter, see [Common attachments filter in anti-malware policies](anti-malware-protection-about.md#common-attachments-filter-in-anti-malware-policies). <br><br> <sup>\*</sup> The common attachments filter is on by default in new anti-malware policies that you create in the Defender portal. The common attachments filter is off by default in the default anti-malware policy and in new policies that you create in PowerShell.|
|Common attachment filter notifications: **When these file types are found** (_FileTypeAction_)|**Reject the message with a non-delivery report (NDR)** (`Reject`)|**Reject the message with a non-delivery report (NDR)** (`Reject`)|**Reject the message with a non-delivery report (NDR)** (`Reject`)||

|**Subject** (_CustomExternalSubject_)|Blank|Blank|Blank||
|**Message** (_CustomExternalBody_)|Blank|Blank|Blank||

### EOP anti-spam policy settings

To create and configure anti-spam policies, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](anti-spam-policies-configure.md).

Wherever you select **Quarantine message** as the action for a spam filter verdict, a **Select quarantine policy** box is available. Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

If you _change_ the action of a spam filtering verdict to **Quarantine message** when you create anti-spam policies the Defender portal, the **Select quarantine policy** box is blank by default. A blank value means the default quarantine policy for that spam filtering verdict is used. These default quarantine policies enforce the historical capabilities for the spam filter verdict that quarantined the message as described in the table [here](quarantine-end-user.md). When you later view or edit the anti-spam policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown.

Admins can create or use quarantine policies with more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities. For instructions, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).

|Security feature name|Default|Standard|Strict|Comment|

The behavior for the value **Default** will eventually change to apply the action for high confidence phishing detections in the policy as if you selected **High confidence phishing messages**. Check the Message Center for announcements to changes in this setting.|
|**Retain spam in quarantine for this many days** (_QuarantineRetentionPeriod_)|15 days|30 days|30 days|This value also affects messages that are quarantined by anti-phishing policies. For more information, see [Quarantined email messages in EOP](quarantine-about.md).|
|**Enable spam safety tips** (_InlineSafetyTipsEnabled_)|Selected (`$true`)|Selected (`$true`)|Selected (`$true`)||

|**Allow & block list**|||||
|Allowed senders (_AllowedSenders_)|None|None|None||
|Allowed sender domains (_AllowedSenderDomains_)|None|None|None|Adding domains to the allowed senders list is a very bad idea. Attackers would be able to send you email that would otherwise be filtered out. <br><br> Use the [spoof intelligence insight](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md) and the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-email-spoof-configure.md#spoofed-senders-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list) to review all senders who are spoofing sender email addresses in your organization's email domains or spoofing sender email addresses in external domains.|
|Blocked senders (_BlockedSenders_)|None|None|None||
|Blocked sender domains (_BlockedSenderDomains_)|None|None|None||

¹ As described in [Full access permissions and quarantine notifications](quarantine-policies.md#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications), your organization might use NotificationEnabledPolicy instead of DefaultFullAccessPolicy in the default security policy or in new custom security policies that you create. The only difference between these two quarantine policies is quarantine notifications are turned on in NotificationEnabledPolicy and turned off in DefaultFullAccessPolicy.

#### ASF settings in anti-spam policies

For more information about Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in anti-spam policies, see [Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in EOP](anti-spam-policies-asf-settings-about.md).

|Security feature name|Default|Recommended<br>Standard|Recommended<br>Strict|Comment|

|**Backscatter** (_MarkAsSpamNdrBackscatter_)|Off|Off|Off||
|**Test mode** (_TestModeAction_)|None|None|None|For ASF settings that support **Test** as an action, you can configure the test mode action to **None**, **Add default X-Header text**, or **Send Bcc message** (`None`, `AddXHeader`, or `BccMessage`). For more information, see [Enable, disable, or test ASF settings](anti-spam-policies-asf-settings-about.md#enable-disable-or-test-asf-settings).|

> [!NOTE]
> ASF adds `X-CustomSpam:` X-header fields to messages _after_ the messages have been processed by Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), so you can't use mail flow rules to identify and act on messages that were filtered by ASF.

#### EOP outbound spam policy settings

To create and configure outbound spam policies, see [Configure outbound spam filtering in EOP](outbound-spam-policies-configure.md).

For more information about the default sending limits in the service, see [Sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits-1).

> [!NOTE]
> Outbound spam policies are not part of Standard or Strict preset security policies. The **Standard** and **Strict** values indicate our **recommended** values in the default outbound spam policy or custom outbound spam policies that you create.

|Security feature name|Default|Recommended<br>Standard|Recommended<br>Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Set an external message limit** (_RecipientLimitExternalPerHour_)|0|500|400|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Set an internal message limit** (_RecipientLimitInternalPerHour_)|0|1000|800|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Set a daily message limit** (_RecipientLimitPerDay_)|0|1000|800|The default value 0 means use the service defaults.|
|**Restriction placed on users who reach the message limit** (_ActionWhenThresholdReached_)|**Restrict the user from sending mail until the following day** (`BlockUserForToday`)|**Restrict the user from sending mail** (`BlockUser`)|**Restrict the user from sending mail** (`BlockUser`)||
|**Automatic forwarding rules** (_AutoForwardingMode_)|**Automatic - System-controlled** (`Automatic`)|**Automatic - System-controlled** (`Automatic`)|**Automatic - System-controlled** (`Automatic`)|
|**Send a copy of outbound messages that exceed these limits to these users and groups** (_BccSuspiciousOutboundMail_ and _BccSuspiciousOutboundAdditionalRecipients_)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|We have no specific recommendation for this setting. <br><br> This setting works only in the default outbound spam policy. It doesn't work in custom outbound spam policies that you create.|
|**Notify these users and groups if a sender is blocked due to sending outbound spam** (_NotifyOutboundSpam_ and _NotifyOutboundSpamRecipients_)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|Not selected (`$false` and Blank)|The default [alert policy](../../compliance/alert-policies.md) named **User restricted from sending email** already sends email notifications to members of the **TenantAdmins** (**Global admins**) group when users are blocked due to exceeding the limits in policy. **We strongly recommend that you use the alert policy rather than this setting in the outbound spam policy to notify admins and other users**. For instructions, see [Verify the alert settings for restricted users](removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam.md#verify-the-alert-settings-for-restricted-users).|

### EOP anti-phishing policy settings

For more information about these settings, see [Spoof settings](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings). To configure these settings, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in EOP](anti-phishing-policies-eop-configure.md).

The spoof settings are inter-related, but the **Show first contact safety tip** setting has no dependency on spoof settings.

Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

Although the **Apply quarantine policy** value appears unselected when you create an anti-phishing policy in the Defender portal, the quarantine policy named DefaultFullAccessPolicy¹ is used if you don't select a quarantine policy. This policy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as spoof as described in the table [here](quarantine-end-user.md). When you later view or edit the quarantine policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown.

Admins can create or use quarantine policies with more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities. For instructions, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).

¹ As described in [Full access permissions and quarantine notifications](quarantine-policies.md#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications), your organization might use NotificationEnabledPolicy instead of DefaultFullAccessPolicy in the default security policy or in new custom security policies that you create. The only difference between these two quarantine policies is quarantine notifications are turned on in NotificationEnabledPolicy and turned off in DefaultFullAccessPolicy.

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

Additional security benefits come with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 subscription. For the latest news and information, you can see [What's new in Defender for Office 365](defender-for-office-365-whats-new.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The default anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides [spoof protection](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#spoof-settings) and mailbox intelligence for all recipients. However, the other available [impersonation protection](#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) features and [advanced settings](#advanced-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) are not configured or enabled in the default policy. To enable all protection features, use one of the following methods:
>   - Turn on and use the Standard and/or Strict [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md) and configure impersonation protection there.
>   - Modify the default anti-phishing policy.
>   - Create additional anti-phishing policies.
>
> - Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy or Safe Links policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection and Safe Links protection to all recipients who aren't defined in the Standard preset security policy, the Strict preset security policy, or in custom Safe Attachments or Safe Links policies). For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).
>
> - [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md) protection and [Safe Documents](safe-documents-in-e5-plus-security-about.md) protection have no dependencies on Safe Links policies.

If your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or if you've purchased Defender for Office 365 as an add-on, set the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

EOP customers get basic anti-phishing as previously described, but Defender for Office 365 includes more features and control to help prevent, detect, and remediate against attacks. To create and configure these policies, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md).

#### Advanced settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about this setting, see [Advanced phishing thresholds in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#advanced-phishing-thresholds-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). To configure this setting, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md).

|Security feature name|Default|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|**Phishing email threshold** (_PhishThresholdLevel_)|**1 - Standard** (`1`)|**3 - More aggressive** (`3`)|**4 - Most aggressive** (`4`)||

#### Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about these settings, see [Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-about.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). To configure these settings, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md).

Wherever you select **Quarantine the message** as the action for an impersonation verdict, an **Apply quarantine policy** box is available. Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

Although the **Apply quarantine policy** value appears unselected when you create an anti-phishing policy in the Defender portal, the quarantine policy named DefaultFullAccessPolicy is used if you don't select a quarantine policy. This policy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as impersonation as described in the table [here](quarantine-end-user.md). When you later view or edit the quarantine policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown.

Admins can create or use quarantine policies with more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities. For instructions, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).

¹ As described in [Full access permissions and quarantine notifications](quarantine-policies.md#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications), your organization might use NotificationEnabledPolicy instead of DefaultFullAccessPolicy in the default security policy or in new custom security policies that you create. The only difference between these two quarantine policies is quarantine notifications are turned on in NotificationEnabledPolicy and turned off in DefaultFullAccessPolicy.

These are the same settings that are available in [anti-spam policy settings in EOP](#eop-anti-spam-policy-settings).

### Safe Attachments settings

Safe Attachments in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes global settings that have no relationship to Safe Attachments policies, and settings that are specific to each Safe Links policy. For more information, see [Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365](safe-attachments-about.md).

Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection to all recipients who aren't defined in the Standard or Strict preset security policies or in custom Safe Attachments policies. For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

#### Global settings for Safe Attachments

> [!NOTE]
> The global settings for Safe Attachments are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, but not by the **Standard** or **Strict** preset security policies. Either way, admins can modify these global Safe Attachments settings at any time.
>
> The **Default** column shows the values before the existence of the **Built-in protection** preset security policy. The **Built-in protection** column shows the values that are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, which are also our recommended values.

To configure these settings, see [Turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-configure.md) and [Safe Documents in Microsoft 365 E5](safe-documents-in-e5-plus-security-about.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [Set-AtpPolicyForO365](/powershell/module/exchange/set-atppolicyforo365) cmdlet for these settings.

|**Turn on Safe Documents for Office clients** (_EnableSafeDocs_)|Off (`$false`)|On (`$true`)|This feature is available and meaningful only with licenses that aren't included in Defender for Office 365 (for example, Microsoft 365 A5 or Microsoft 365 E5 Security). For more information, see [Safe Documents in Microsoft 365 A5 or E5 Security](safe-documents-in-e5-plus-security-about.md).|
|**Allow people to click through Protected View even if Safe Documents identified the file as malicious** (_AllowSafeDocsOpen_)|Off (`$false`)|Off (`$false`)|This setting is related to Safe Documents.|

#### Safe Attachments policy settings

To configure these settings, see [Set up Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365](safe-attachments-policies-configure.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [New-SafeAttachmentPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-safeattachmentpolicy) and [Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-safelinkspolicy) cmdlets for these settings.

> [!NOTE]
> As described earlier, although there's no default Safe Attachments policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection to all recipients who aren't defined in the Standard preset security policy, the Strict preset security policy, or in custom Safe Attachments policies.
>
> The **Default in custom** column refers to the default values in new Safe Attachments policies that you create. The remaining columns indicate (unless otherwise noted) the values that are configured in the corresponding preset security policies.

Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

The policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as malware as described in the table [here](quarantine-end-user.md).

Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware by Safe Attachments, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware messages.

### Safe Links policy settings

For more information about Safe Links protection, see [Safe Links in Defender for Office 365](safe-links-about.md).

Although there's no default Safe Links policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Links protection to all recipients who aren't defined in the Standard preset security policy, the Strict preset security policy or in custom Safe Links policies. For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

To configure Sae Links policy settings, see [Set up Safe Links policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](safe-links-policies-configure.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [New-SafeLinksPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-safelinkspolicy) and [Set-SafeLinksPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-safelinkspolicy) cmdlets for Safe Links policy settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Default in custom** column refers to the default values in new Safe Links policies that you create. The remaining columns indicate (unless otherwise noted) the values that are configured in the corresponding preset security policies.
