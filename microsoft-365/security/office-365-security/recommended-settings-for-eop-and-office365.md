# Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for Microsoft 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes. But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are often required. **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** Plan 1 or Plan 2 contain additional features that give admins more layers of security, control, and investigation.

Although we empower security administrators to customize their security settings, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: **Standard** and **Strict**. Although customer environments and needs are different, these levels of filtering will help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees' Inbox in most situations.

To automatically apply the Standard or Strict settings to users, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

This article describes the default settings, and also the recommended Standard and Strict settings to help protect your users. The tables contain the settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

> [!TIP]
> You can't change the recommended Standard and Strict settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. To change recommended values like **Enable users to protect**, you need to use [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
>
> The Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA) module for PowerShell can help you (admins) find the current values of these settings. Specifically, the **Get-ORCAReport** cmdlet generates an assessment of anti-spam, anti-phishing, and other message hygiene settings. You can download the ORCA module at <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/>.

## Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection in EOP

Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing are EOP features that can be configured by admins. We recommend the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### EOP anti-spam policy settings

To create and configure anti-spam policies, see [Configure anti-spam policies in EOP](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).

#### ASF settings in anti-spam policies

The table in this section describes the Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings that are available in anti-spam policies. All of these settings are **Off** for both **Standard** and **Strict** levels. For more information about ASF settings, see [Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in EOP](advanced-spam-filtering-asf-options.md).

#### EOP outbound spam policy settings

To create and configure outbound spam policies, see [Configure outbound spam filtering in EOP](configure-the-outbound-spam-policy.md).

For more information about the default sending limits in the service, see [Sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits-1).

For instructions, see [Verify the alert settings for restricted users](removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam.md#verify-the-alert-settings-for-restricted-users).|

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

Additional security benefits come with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 subscription. For the latest news and information, you can see [What's new in Defender for Office 365](whats-new-in-defender-for-office-365.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The default anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides [spoof protection](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#spoof-settings) and mailbox intelligence for all recipients. However, the other available [impersonation protection](#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) features and [advanced settings](#advanced-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) are not configured or enabled in the default policy. To enable all protection features, modify the default anti-phishing policy or create additional anti-phishing policies.
>
> - Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy or Safe Links policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection and Safe Links protection to all recipients (users who aren't defined in custom Safe Attachments policies or Safe Links policies). For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).
>
> - [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) protection and [Safe Documents](safe-docs.md) protection have no dependencies on Safe Links policies.

If your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or if you've purchased Defender for Office 365 as an add-on, set the following Standard or Strict configurations.

### Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

EOP customers get basic anti-phishing as previously described, but Defender for Office 365 includes more features and control to help prevent, detect, and remediate against attacks. To create and configure these policies, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.md).

#### Advanced settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

For more information about this setting, see [Advanced phishing thresholds in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#advanced-phishing-thresholds-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). To configure this setting, see [Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.md).

#### EOP anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

These are the same settings that are available in [anti-spam policy settings in EOP](#eop-anti-spam-policy-settings).

The spoof settings are inter-related, but the **Show first contact safety tip** setting has no dependency on spoof settings.

### Safe Attachments settings

Safe Attachments in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes global settings that have no relationship to Safe Attachments policies, and settings that are specific to each Safe Links policy. For more information, see [Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365](safe-attachments.md).

Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy, the **Built-in protection** preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection to all recipients (users who aren't defined in custom Safe Attachments policies). For more information, see [Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365](preset-security-policies.md).

#### Global settings for Safe Attachments

> [!NOTE]
> The global settings for Safe Attachments are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, but not by the **Standard** or **Strict** preset security policies. Either way, admins can modify these global Safe Attachments settings at any time.
>
> The **Default** column shows the values before the existence of the **Built-in protection** preset security policy. The **Built-in protection** column shows the values that are set by the **Built-in protection** preset security policy, which are also our recommended values.

To configure these settings, see [Turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](turn-on-mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) and [Safe Documents in Microsoft 365 E5](safe-docs.md).

In PowerShell, you use the [Set-AtpPolicyForO365](/powershell/module/exchange/set-atppolicyforo365) cmdlet for these settings.
