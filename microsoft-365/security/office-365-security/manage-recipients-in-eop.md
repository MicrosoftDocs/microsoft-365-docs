# Manage recipients in standalone EOP

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
-  [Exchange Online Protection standalone](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)

Standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes support the following types of recipients:

- **Mail users**: Mail users are the fundamental type of user accounts in your standalone EOP organization. Mail users have logon credentials in your EOP organization, but they have external email addresses (their mailboxes are located outside of your EOP organization).

  For more information about managing mail users in EOP, see [Manage mail users in EOP](manage-mail-users-in-eop.md).

- **Groups**: You can create the following types of groups:

  - Distribution groups
  - Mail-enabled security groups

  For more information about managing groups in EOP, see [Manage groups in EOP](manage-groups-in-eop.md).
