# Training campaigns in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes features that are in Public Preview, aren't available in all organizations, and are subject to change.

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, Training campaigns are a faster, more direct way to provide security training to users. Instead of creating and launching [simulated phishing attacks](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md) that eventually lead to training, you can create and assign Training campaigns directly to users.

A Training campaign contains one or more built-in Training modules that you select. Currently, there are over 70 Training modules to select from. For more information about Training modules, see [Training modules for Training campaigns in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-training-modules.md).

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the existing Training campaigns, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. To go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

The **Training campaigns** tab lists the Training campaigns that you've created. The list includes the following information for each Training campaign:

- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Duration (mins)**
- **Date of completion**
- **Training completion**: The number of users who were included in the Training campaign and how many of them completed the training. The information is shown as a fraction (for example, **2/5**) and in a corresponding horizontal bar graph.
- **No. of training modules**: The number of training modules that are included in the Training campaign.
- **Created by**
- **Created time**
- **Status**: One of the following values:
  - **Completed**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **In progress**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Draft**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Cancelled**
  - **Deleted**
  - **Failed**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Scheduled**<sup>\*</sup>
- **â‹® Actions**:
  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png"::: **Delete**
  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-eye-icon.png"::: **View report**

To find a Training campaign in the list, use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: **Search** box to find the name of the Training campaign.

Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Filter** to filter the information on the page by the **Status** value of the Training campaign.

<sup>\*</sup> The total count of Training campaigns with these **Status** values is also shown at the top of the page. But if you filter the information (for example, exclude on of these **Status** values), the count at the top of the page will be **0** for that excluded **Status** value.

## Create Training campaigns

To create a Training campaign, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

2. On the **Training** tab,select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Create new**.

3. The new Training campaign wizard opens. The rest of this section describes the pages and the settings they contain.

### Name Training campaign

On the **Name Training campaign** page, configure the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique name.
- **Description**: Enter an optional description.

When you're finished, click **Next**.

### Target users

On the **Target users** page, select one of the following values:

- **Include all users in my organization**

- **Include only specific users and groups**: When this value is selected, use the following options to find and select the users or groups to include in the Training campaign:
  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Add users**: In the **Add users** flyout that appears, use the following options to find and select users:
  - **Search for users or groups**: In the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: **Search** box, enter three or more letters of the user or group name, and then press Enter. The results (if any) are shown in the **User list** section that appears.
    - To clear the search results without selecting any users or groups and return to all filters on the **Add users** flyout, select **Add/Edit**.
    - To clear the text from the search box and the entries from the **User list** section but remain in user/group search mode, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: in the search box.
    - To clear any *selections* in the **User list** section but preserve the text in the search box and the actual entries in the list, select **Clear all selections**.
    - When you're done selecting entries from the **User list** section, select **Add n user(s)**. You'll return to the **Target users** page where the selected users are shown in a list. To return to the **Add users** flyout, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Add users**.

    Repeat this step as many times as required.

  - **Filter users by categories**: Use the following categories to filter and select users and groups. Multiple selections within the same category use the OR operator (for example, **User tags** equals **Priority account** OR **User tags** equals **High risk profile**). Selections from different categories use the AND operator (for example, **City** equals Redmond AND **Department** equals IT):

    - **Suggested user groups**: Select one or both of the following values:
      - **Users not targeted by a simulation in the last three months**
      - **Repeat offenders**

    - **User tags**: Select one or more of the following values. You'll need to click **See all user tags** to see all values, and custom [user tags](user-tags-about.md) aren't available:
      - **Priority accounts**: For more information, see [Priority accounts](../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md).
        - **High risk profile**
        - **Medium risk profile**
        - **Low risk profile**

    - **City**, **Department**, or **Title** properties: In each section, the following options are available:
      - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: **Search by**: Type the property value and select it from the list of results.
      - The first three values for each property are shown. To see all values for the specific property, select the **All \<property>** link. Select one or more values.
      - Select **All \<property\>** to select all values for the specific property.

    After you select values from one or more categories, select **Apply(n)**. The results (if any) are shown in the **User list** section that appears.

    - To not select any users or groups and return to all filters on the **Add users** flyout, select **Add/Edit**.
    - To clear any *selections* in the **User list** section but preserve the actual entries in the list, select **Clear all selections**.
    - When you're done selecting entries from the **User list** section, select **Add n user(s)**. You'll return to the **Target users** page where the selected users are shown in a list. To return to the **Add users** flyout, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Add users**.

    Repeat this step as many times as required.

  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-import-icon.png"::: **Import**: In the dialog that opens, find and select a .csv file.

After you've selected one or more users or groups, the following information is shown for each entry on the **Target users** page:

- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Title**
- **Type**: **User** or **Group**
- **Delete**: Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png"::: **Delete** icon to remove the entry from the list. Select **Confirm** in the confirmation dialog**.

3. Click **Confirm** in the warning dialog that opens.

## Set the training threshold time period

The training threshold time period is the number of days for which a training module will not be re-assigned to a user who meets either of the following criteria:

- They've already completed the same training module during the threshold time period.
- They're actively assigned the same training module during the threshold time period.

The training threshold starts from the time of user training module assignment.

We recommend the number of days for the training threshold assignment to be greater than the number of days that a user would have to complete a training module assignment.

In the training campaign user report, a user may have the following **Status** values:

- **Completed**: The user has already completed their training module.
- **In Progress**: The user has started their training module.
- **Not Started**: The user hasn't started their training module.
- **Training Already Completed**: The user was previously assigned and completed the training module within the training threshold time period.
- **Training Previously Assigned**: The user currently has been assigned the training module within the training threshold time period, but hasn't completed the training. The user can still complete the training module to move it to a **Completed** state.
- **Overdue**: The user hasn't completed the training before the assigned module due date and has not been reassigned the same training module within the training threshold period.
- **Not Completed**: The user hasn't completed the training module within the assigned module due date and/ or is outside the training threshold period and is eligible for the same training module reassignment.

To set the training threshold, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Settings** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Settings** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=setting>.

2. Set the value in days for the training threshold time period. The default value is 90 days. To remove training threshold and always assign training, set value to 0.

3. When you're finished, click **Save**.
