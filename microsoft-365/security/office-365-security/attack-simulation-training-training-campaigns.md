# Training campaigns in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, Training campaigns are a faster, more direct way to provide security training to users. Instead of creating and launching [simulated phishing attacks](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md) that eventually lead to training, you can create and assign Training campaigns directly to users.

A Training campaign contains one or more built-in Training modules that you select. Currently, there are over 70 Training modules to select from. For more information about Training modules, see [Training modules for Training campaigns in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-training-modules.md).

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the existing Training campaigns, open the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. To go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

The **Training** tab lists the Training campaigns that you've created. The list includes the following information for each Training campaign<sup>\*</sup>:

- **Campaign name**
- **Description**
- **Total duration (mins)**
- **Training completion** (date/time)
- **Training completion**: The number of users who were included in the Training campaign and how many of them completed the training. The information is shown as a fraction (for example, **2/5**) and in a corresponding horizontal bar graph.
- **No. of training modules**: The number of training modules that are included in the Training campaign.
- **Created by**
- **Created time**
- **Status**: One of the following values:
  - **Completed**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **In progress**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Draft**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Canceled**
  - **Deleted**
  - **Failed**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Scheduled**<sup>\*\*</sup>

  For more information about the **Status** values, see the [Set the training threshold](#set-the-training-threshold) section later in this article.

Select a column header to sort by that column. To add or remove columns, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns**. By default, all available columns are selected.

<sup>\*</sup> To see all columns, you likely need to do one or more of the following steps:

- Horizontally scroll in your web browser.
- Narrow the width of appropriate columns.
- Remove columns from the view.
- Zoom out in your web browser.

Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Filter** to filter the information on the page by the **Status** value of the Training campaign.

<sup>\*\*</sup> The total count of Training campaigns with these **Status** values is also shown at the top of the page. But if you filter the information (for example, exclude on of these **Status** values), the count at the top of the page is **0** for that excluded **Status** value.

To find a Training campaign in the list, type part of the campaign name in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: **Search** box and then press the ENTER key.

To see details about a Training campaign, see the [View Training campaign details](#view-training-campaign-details) section.

## Create Training campaigns

To create a Training campaign, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

2. On the **Training** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Create new** to start the new Training campaign wizard.

   The following sections describe the steps and configuration options to create a Training campaign.

   > [!NOTE]
   > At any point after you name the Training campaign during the new Training campaign wizard, you can select **Save and close** to save your progress and continue later. The incomplete Training campaign has the **Status** value **Draft**. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the Training campaign and then clicking the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit** action that appears.

After you remove the Training campaign, it's no longer listed on the **Training** tab.

## Set the training threshold

The _training threshold_ prevents users from having the same trainings assigned to them during a specific interval in days. The default value is 90 days.

During the time interval, the same training module won't be reassigned to users who meet either of the following criteria:

- They completed the training module during the training threshold.
- They haven't completed the training module, but the module was assigned to them during the training threshold.

The training threshold starts when a training module is assigned to a user.

We recommend that the training threshold is greater than the number of days that a user has to complete a training module.

In the training campaign user report, the **Status** value shows the effect of the training threshold on users and their assigned trainings modules:

- **Completed**: The user completed the training module.
- **In Progress**: The user started the training module.
- **Not Started**: The user hasn't started the training module.
- **Training Previously Assigned**: The training module was assigned to the user during the training threshold, but the user hasn't completed the training yet. The user can still complete the training module, at which point the **Status** value changes to **Completed**.
- **Overdue**: The user hasn't completed the training module before the assigned due date and the same training module hasn't been reassigned to the user during the training threshold.
- **Not Completed**: The user hasn't completed the training module within the assigned due date and/or outside the training threshold. This status makes the user eligible to have the same training module reassigned to them.

You set the training threshold on the **Settings** tab on the **Attack simulation training** page. For more information about the **Settings** tab, see [Global settings in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-settings.md).

To set the training threshold on the **Settings** tab, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Settings** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Settings** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=setting>.

2. Set the value in days for the training threshold time period. The default value is 90 days. To remove the training threshold and always assign training, set value to 0.

3. When you're finished on the **Settings** tab, select **Save**.
