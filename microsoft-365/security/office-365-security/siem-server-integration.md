# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) server integration with Microsoft 365 services and applications

## Summary

Is your organization using or planning to get a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) server? You might be wondering how it integrates with Microsoft 365 or Office 365. This article provides a list of resources you can use to integrate your SIEM server with Microsoft 365 services and applications.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have a SIEM server yet and are exploring your options, consider **[Microsoft Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview)**.

## Do I need a SIEM server?

Whether you need a SIEM server depends on many factors, such as your organization's security requirements and where your data resides. Microsoft 365 includes a wide variety of security features that meet many organizations' security needs without additional servers, such as a SIEM server. Some organizations have special circumstances that require the use of a SIEM server. Here are some examples:

- *Fabrikam* has some content and applications on premises, and some in the cloud (they have a hybrid cloud deployment). To get security reports across all their content and applications, Fabrikam has implemented a SIEM server.

- *Contoso* is a financial services organization that has particularly stringent security requirements. They have added a SIEM server to their environment to take advantage of the extra security protection they require.

## SIEM server integration with Microsoft 365

A SIEM server can receive data from a wide variety of Microsoft 365 services and applications. The following table lists several Microsoft 365 services and applications, along with SIEM server inputs and resources to learn more.

****

|Microsoft 365 Service or Application|SIEM server inputs/methods|Resources to learn more|
|---|---|---|
|[Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md)|Audit logs|[SIEM integration with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](siem-integration-with-office-365-ti.md)|
|[Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/)|HTTPS endpoint hosted in Azure <br/>REST API|[Pull alerts to your SIEM tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-siem)|
|[Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)|Log integration|[SIEM integration with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/siem)|

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at [Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview). Azure Sentinel comes with connectors for Microsoft solutions. These connectors are available "out of the box" and provide for real-time integration. You can use Azure Sentinel with your Microsoft Threat Protection solutions and Microsoft 365 services, including Office 365, Azure AD, Azure ATP, Microsoft Cloud App Security, and more.

### Audit logging must be turned on

Make sure that audit logging is turned on before you configure SIEM server integration.

- For SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Azure Active Directory, [audit logging is turned on in the Security & Compliance Center](../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md).

- For Exchange Online, see [Manage mailbox auditing](../../compliance/enable-mailbox-auditing.md).
