# The Email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Microsoft 365 organizations that have [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](mdo-about.md) included in their subscription or purchased as an add-on have the _Email entity page_. The Email entity page in the Microsoft Defender portal contains highly detailed information about an email message and any related entities.

This article explains the information and actions on the Email entity page.

## Permissions and licensing for the Email entity page

To use the Email entity page, you need to be assigned permissions. The permissions and licensing are the same as Threat Explorer (Explorer) and Real-time detections. For more information, see [Permissions and licensing for Threat Explorer and Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md#permissions-and-licensing-for-threat-explorer-and-real-time-detections).

## Where to find the Email entity page

There are no direct links to the **Email entity** page from the top levels of the Defender portal. Instead, the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open email entity** action is available at the top of the email details flyout in many Defender for Office 365 features. This email details flyout is known as _the Email summary panel_, and contains a summarized subset of the information on the Email entity page. The email summary panel is identical across Defender for Office 365 features. For more information, see the [The Email summary panel](#the-email-summary-panel) section later in this article.

The Email summary panel with the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open email entity** action is available in the following locations:

## What's on the Email entity page

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-main-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Email entity page showing the available details pane and tabs." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-main-page.png":::

The details pane on the left side of the page contains collapsible sections with details about the message. These sections remain constant as long as you're on the page. The available sections are:

- **Tags** section. Shows any user tags (including Priority account) that are assigned to senders or recipients. For more information about user tags, see [User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](user-tags-about.md).
- **Detection details** section:
  - **Original Threats**
  - **Original delivery location**:
    - **Deleted Items folder**
    - **Dropped**
    - **Delivered failed**
    - **Inbox folder**
    - **Junk Email folder**
    - **External**
    - **Quarantine**
    - **Unknown**
  - **Latest Threats**
  - **Latest delivery location**: The location of the message after system actions on the message (for example, [ZAP](zero-hour-auto-purge.md)), or admin actions on the message (for example, [Move to Deleted Items](threat-explorer-threat-hunting.md#email-remediation)). User actions on the message (for example, deleting or archiving the message) aren't shown, so this value doesn't guarantee the _current location_ of the message.

    > [!TIP]
    > There are scenarios where **Original delivery location**/**Latest delivery location** and/or **Delivery action** have the value **Unknown**. For example:
    >
    > - The message was delivered (**Delivery action** is **Delivered**), but an Inbox rule moved the message to a default folder other than the Inbox or Junk Email folder (for example, the Draft or Archive folder).
    > - ZAP attempted to move the message after delivery, but the message wasn't found (for example, the user moved or deleted the message).

The tabs (views) along the top of the page allow you to investigate email efficiently. These views are described in the following subsections.

### Timeline view

The **Timeline** view shows the delivery and post-delivery events that happened to the message.

The following message event information is available in the view. Select a column header to sort by that column. To add or remove columns, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns**. By default, all available columns are selected.

- **Timeline** (date/time of the event)
- **Source**: For example: **System**, **Admin, or **User**.
- **Event types**
- **Result**
- **Threats**
- **Details**

If nothing happened to the message after delivery, the message is likely to have only one row in the **Timeline** view with the **Event types** value **Original delivery**. For example:

- The **Result** value is **Inbox folder - Delivered**.
- The **Result** value is **Junk email folder - Delivered to Junk**
- The **Result** value is **Quarantine - Blocked**.

Subsequent actions to the message by users, admins, or Microsoft 365 add more rows to the view. For example:

- The **Event types** value is **ZAP** and the **Result** value is **Message moved to Quarantine by ZAP**.
- The **Event types** value is **Quarantine Release** and the **Result** value is **Message was successfully released from Quarantine**.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box to find information on the page. Type text in the box and then press the ENTER key.

Use :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to export the data in the view to a CSV file. The default filename is **- Microsoft Defender.csv** and the default location is the **Downloads** folder. If a file with that name already exists, the filename is appended with a number (for example, **- Microsoft Defender(1).csv**).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-timeline-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Timeline view on the Email entity page." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-timeline-view.png":::

### Analysis view

The **Analysis** view contains information that helps you analyze the message in depth. The following information is available in this view:

- **Threat detection details** section: Information about threats detected in the message:
  - **Threats**: The primary threat is indicated by :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-primary-threat-icon.png" border="false"::: **Primary threat**.
  - **Confidence level**: Values are **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
  - **Priority account protection**: Values are **Yes** or **No**. For more information, see [Configure and review priority account protection in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](priority-accounts-turn-on-priority-account-protection.md).
- **Email detection details** section: Information about protection features or overrides that affected the message:
  - **All Overrides**: All organization or user settings that had the possibility to alter the intended delivery location of the message. For example, if the message matched a mail flow rule and a block entry in the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md), both settings are listed here. The **Primary Override : Source** property value identifies the setting that actually affected the delivery of the message.
  - **Primary Override : Source**: Shows the organization or user setting that altered the intended delivery location of the message (allowed instead of blocked, or blocked instead of allowed). For example:
    - The message was blocked by a mail flow rule.
    - The message was allowed due to an entry in the user's [Safe Senders list](configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes.md).
  - **Exchange transport rules** (mail flow rules): If the message was affected by mail flow rules, the rule names and GUID vales are shown. Actions taken on messages by mail flow rules occur before spam and phishing verdicts.

    The :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy to clipboard** action is available to copy the rule GUID. For more information about mail flow rules, see [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules).

  - **Connector**: If the message was delivered through an Inbound connector, the connector name is shown. For more information about connectors, see [Configure mail flow using connectors in Exchange Online](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow).
  - **Bulk complaint level (BCL)**: A higher BCL value indicates the message is more likely to be spam. For more information, see [Bulk complaint level (BCL) in EOP](anti-spam-bulk-complaint-level-bcl-about.md).
  - **Policy**: If a policy type is listed here (for example, **Spam**), select **Configure** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: to open the related policy page (for example, the **Anti-spam policies** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/antispam>).
  - **Policy action**
  - **Alert ID**: Select the Alert ID value to open the details page for the alert (as if you found and selected the alert from the **Alerts** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/alerts>). The :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy to clipboard** action is also available to copy the Alert ID value.

  - **To**: Shows the first 5,000 characters of any email addresses in the To field of the message.
  - **Cc**: Shows the first 5,000 characters of any email addresses in the Cc field of the message.
  - **Distribution list**: Shows the distribution group (distribution list) if the recipient received the email as a member of the list. The top level distribution group is shown for nested distribution groups.
  - **Forwarding**: Indicates whether the message was [automatically forwarded to an external email address](outbound-spam-policies-external-email-forwarding.md). The forwarding user and the forwarding type are shown (mail flow rules, Inbox rules, or SMTP forwarding).

  <sup>\*</sup> The :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy to clipboard** action is available to copy the value.

- **Authentication** section: Details about [email authentication](email-authentication-about.md) results:
  - **[Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC)](email-authentication-dmarc-configure.md)**
    - `Pass`: The DMARC check for the message passed.
    - `Fail`: The DMARC check for the message failed.
    - `BestGuessPass`: The DMARC TXT record for the domain doesn't, but if one existed, the DMARC check for the message would have passed.
    - None: Indicates that no DMARC TXT record exists for the sending domain in DNS.
  - **[DomainKeys identified mail (DKIM)](email-authentication-dkim-configure.md)**: Values are:
    - `Pass`: The DKIM check for the message passed.
    - `Fail (reason)`: The DKIM check for the message failed. For example, the message wasn't DKIM signed or the DKIM signature wasn't verified.
    - `None`: The message wasn't DKIM signed. This result might or might not indicate that the domain has a DKIM record, or that the DKIM record doesn't evaluate to a result. This result only indicates that this message wasn't signed.
  - **[Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](email-authentication-spf-configure.md)**: Values are:
    - `Pass (IP address)`: The SPF check found the message source is valid for the domain.
    - `Fail (IP address)`: The SPF check found the message source isn't valid for the domain, and the enforcement rule in the SPF record is `-all` (hard fail).
    - `SoftFail (reason)`: The SPF check found the message source isn't valid for the domain, and the enforcement rule in the SPF record is `~all` (soft fail).
    - `Neutral`: The SPF check found the message source isn't valid for the domain, and the enforcement rule in the SPF record is `?all` (neutral).
    - `None`: The domain doesn't have an SPF record, or the SPF record doesn't evaluate to a result.
    - `TempError`: The SPF check encountered a temporary error (for example, a DNS error). The same check later might succeed.
    - `PermError`: The SPF check encountered a permanent error. For example, the domain has a [badly formatted SPF record](email-authentication-spf-configure.md#troubleshooting-spf-txt-records).
  - **Composite authentication**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and other information determines if the message sender (the From address) is authentic. For more information, see [Composite authentication](email-authentication-about.md#composite-authentication).
- **Related entities** section: Information about attachments and URLs in the message:
  - **Entity**: Selecting **Attachments** or **URLs** takes you to the Attachments view or the URL view of the Email entity page for the message.
  - **Total count**
  - **Threats found**: The values are **Yes** or **No**.
- Message details area:
  - **Plain-text email header** tab: Contains the entire message header in plain text. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy message header** to copy the message header.

  - **To** tab: Shows the first 5,000 characters of any email addresses in the To field of the message.
  - **Cc** tab: Shows the first 5,000 characters of any email addresses in the Cc field of the message.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-analysis-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analysis view on the Email entity page." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-analysis-view.png":::

### Attachments view

The **Attachments** view shows information about all file attachments in the message, and the scanning results of those attachments.

The following attachment information is available in this view. Select a column header to sort by that column. To add or remove columns, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns**. By default, all available columns are selected.

- **Attachment filename**: If you click on the filename value
- **File type**
- **File size**
- **File extension**
- **Threat**
- **Malware family**
- **Attachment SHA256**: The :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Copy to clipboard** action is available to copy the SHA256 value.
- **Details**

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-attachments-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Attachments view on the Email entity page." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-attachments-view.png":::

#### Attachment details

If you select an entry in the **Attachments** view by clicking on the **Attachment filename** value, a details flyout opens that contains the following information:

- **Deep analysis** tab: Information is available on this tab if [Safe Attachments](safe-attachments-about.md) scanned (detonated) the attachment. You can identify these messages in Threat Explorer by using the query filter **Detection technology** with the value **File detonation**.

  - **Detonation chain** section: Safe Attachments detonation of a single file can trigger multiple detonations. The _detonation chain_ tracks the path of detonations, including the original malicious file that caused the verdict, and all other files affected by the detonation. These attached files might not be directly present in the email. But, including the analysis is important to determining why the file was found to be malicious.

    If no detonation chain information is available, the value **No detonation tree** is shown. Otherwise, you can select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to download the detonation chain information to a CSV file. The default filename is **Detonation chain.csv** and the default location is the **Downloads** folder. If a file with that name already exists, the filename is appended with a number (for example, **Detonation chain(1).csv**). The CSV file contains the following information:
    - **Top**: The top level file.
    - **Level1**: The next level file.
    - **Level2**: The next level file.
    - and so on.

    The detonation chain and the CSV file might show just the top level item if none of the entities linked to it were found to be problematic or were detonated.

  - **Summary** section: If no detonation summary information is available, the value **No detonation summary** is shown. Otherwise, the following detonation summary information is available:
    - **Analysis time**
    - **Verdict**: The verdict on the attachment itself.
    - **More info**: The file size in bytes.
    - **Indicators of compromise**

  - **Screenshots section**: Show any screenshots that were captured during detonation. No screenshots are captured for container files like ZIP or RAR that contain other files.
  
    If no detonation screenshots are available, the value **No screenshots to display** is shown. Otherwise, select the link to view the screenshot.

  - **Behavior details** section: Shows the exact events that took place during detonation, and problematic or benign observations that contain URLs, IPs, domains, and files that were found during detonation. There might not be any behavior details for container files like ZIP or RAR that contain other files.

     If no behavior details information is available, the value **No detonation behaviors** is shown. Otherwise, you can select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to download the behavioral details information to a CSV file. The default filename is **Behavior details.csv** and the default location is the **Downloads** folder. If a file with that name already exists, the filename is appended with a number (for example, **Behavior details(1).csv**). The CSV file contains the following information:
    - **Time**
    - **Behavior**
    - **Behavior property**
    - **Process (PID)**
    - **Operation**
    - **Target**
    - **Details**
    - **Result**
- **File info** tab: The **File details** section contains the following information:
  - **File name**
  - **SHA256**
  - **File size** (in bytes)

When you're finished in the file details flyout, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png" border="false"::: **Close**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-attachments-view-file-details-flyout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the file details flyout from the Attachments view on the Email entity page." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-attachments-view-file-details-flyout.png":::

#### Block attachments from the Attachments view

If you select an entry in the **Attachments** view by selecting the check box next to the filename, the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-no-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block** action is available. This action adds the file as a [block entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md#block-entries-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list). Selecting **Block** starts the **Take action** wizard:

1. On the **Choose actions** page, configure one of following settings in the **Block file** section:
   - **Never expire** on: This is the default value :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.
   - **Never expire** off: Slide the toggle to off :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-off.png" border="false"::: and then select a date in the **Remove on** box.

   When you're finished on the **Choose actions** page, select **Next**.

#### URL details

If you select an entry in the **URL** view by clicking on the **URL** value, a details flyout opens that contains the following information:

- **Deep analysis** tab: Information is available on this tab if [Safe Links](safe-links-about.md) scanned (detonated) the URL. You can identify these messages in Threat Explorer by using the query filter **Detection technology** with the value **URL detonation**.

  - **Detonation chain** section: Safe Links detonation of a single URL can trigger multiple detonations. The _detonation chain_ tracks the path of detonations, including the original malicious URL that caused the verdict, and all other URLs affected by the detonation. These URLs might not be directly present in the email. But, including the analysis is important to determining why the URL was found to be malicious.

    If no detonation chain information is available, the value **No detonation tree** is shown. Otherwise, you can select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to download the detonation chain information to a CSV file. The default filename is **Detonation chain.csv** and the default location is the **Downloads** folder. If a file with that name already exists, the filename is appended with a number (for example, **Detonation chain(1).csv**). The CSV file contains the following information:
    - **Top**: The top level file.
    - **Level1**: The next level file.
    - **Level2**: The next level file.
    - and so on.

    The detonation chain and the CSV file might show just the top level item if none of the entities linked to it were found to be problematic or were detonated.

  - **Summary** section: If no detonation summary information is available, the value **No detonation summary** is shown. Otherwise, the following detonation summary information is available:
    - **Analysis time**
    - **Verdict**: The verdict on the URL itself.

  - **Screenshots section**: Show any screenshots that were captured during detonation. No screenshots are captured if the URL opens into a link that directly downloads a file. However, you see the downloaded file in the detonation chain.
  
    If no detonation screenshots are available, the value **No screenshots to display** is shown. Otherwise, select the link to view the screenshot.

  - **Behavior details** section: Shows the exact events that took place during detonation, and problematic or benign observations that contain URLs, IPs, domains, and files that were found during detonation.

     If no behavior details information is available, the value **No detonation behaviors** is shown. Otherwise, you can select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to download the behavioral details information to a CSV file. The default filename is **Behavior details.csv** and the default location is the **Downloads** folder. If a file with that name already exists, the filename is appended with a number (for example, **Behavior details(1).csv**). The CSV file contains the following information:
    - **Time**
    - **Behavior**
    - **Behavior property**
    - **Process (PID)**
    - **Operation**
    - **Target**
    - **Details**
    - **Result**
- **URL info** tab: The **URL details** section contains the following information:
  - **URL**
  - **Threat**

When you're finished in the file details flyout, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png" border="false"::: **Close**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/email-entity-url-view-file-details-flyout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the URL details flyout from the URL view on the Email entity page." lightbox="../../media/email-entity-url-view-file-details-flyout.png":::

#### Block URLs from the URL view

If you select an entry in the **URL** view by selecting the check box next to the filename, the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-no-icon.png" border="false"::: **Block** action is available. This action adds the URL as a [block entry in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md#block-entries-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list). Selecting **Block** starts the **Take action** wizard:

1. On the **Choose actions** page, configure one of following settings in the **Block URL** section:

### Actions on the Email entity page

The following actions are available at the top of the Email entity page:

- :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Take action**: For information, see [Remediate using Take action](threat-explorer-threat-hunting.md#remediate-using-take-action).
- :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-view-message-headers-icon.png" border="false"::: **Email preview**Â¹ Â²
- :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More options**:
  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Go to quarantined email**: Available only if the message was quarantined. Selecting this action opens the **Email** tab on the **Quarantine** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine>, filtered by the unique **Message ID** value of the message. For more information, see [View quarantined email](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#view-quarantined-email).
  - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Download email**Â¹ Â²

    > [!TIP]
    > **Download email** isn't available for messages that were quarantined. Instead, [download a password protected copy of the message from quarantine](quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md#download-email-from-quarantine).

Â¹ The **Email preview** and **Download email** actions require the **Preview** role. You can assign this role in the following locations:

- [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role based access control (RBAC)](/microsoft-365/security/defender/manage-rbac) (Affects the Defender portal only, not PowerShell): **Security operations/Raw data (email & collaboration)/Email & collaboration content (read)**.
- [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md): Membership in the **Data Investigator** or **eDiscovery Manager** role groups. Or, you can [create a new role group](mdo-portal-permissions.md#create-email--collaboration-role-groups-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal) with the **Preview** role assigned, and add the users to the custom role group.

Â² You can preview or download email messages that are available in Microsoft 365 mailboxes. Examples of when messages are no longer available in mailboxes include:

- The message was dropped before delivery or delivery failed.
- The message was _soft deleted_ (deleted from the Deleted items folder, which moves the message to the Recoverable Items\Deletions folder).
- ZAP moved the message to quarantine.
