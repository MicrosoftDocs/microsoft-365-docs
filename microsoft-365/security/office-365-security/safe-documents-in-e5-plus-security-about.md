# Safe Documents in Microsoft 365 A5 or E5 Security

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Safe Documents is a premium feature that uses the cloud back end of [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) to scan opened Office documents in [Protected View](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653) or [Application Guard for Office](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/9e0fb9c2-ffad-43bf-8ba3-78f785fdba46).

Users don't need Defender for Endpoint installed on their local devices to get Safe Documents protection. Users get Safe Documents protection if all of the following requirements are met:

- Safe Documents is enabled in the organization as described in this article.
- Licenses from a required licensing plan are assigned to the users. Safe Documents is controlled by the **Office 365 SafeDocs** (or **SAFEDOCS** or **bf6f5520-59e3-4f82-974b-7dbbc4fd27c7**) service plan (also known as a service). This service plan is available in the following licensing plans (also known as license plans, Microsoft 365 plans, or products):
  - Microsoft 365 A5 for Faculty
  - Microsoft 365 A5 for Students
  - Microsoft 365 E5 Security

  Safe Documents isn't included in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 licensing plans.

  For more information, see [Product names and service plan identifiers for licensing](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-service-plan-reference).

- They're using Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (formerly known as Office 365 ProPlus) version 2004 or later.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Safe Attachments** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Exchange Online RBAC](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo):
    - _Configure Safe Documents settings_: Membership in the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
    - _Read-only access to Safe Documents settings_: Membership in the **Global Reader**, **Security Reader**, or **View-Only Organization Management** role groups.
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, **Global Reader**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

### How does Microsoft handle your data?

To keep you protected, Safe Documents sends file information to the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) cloud for analysis. Details on how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint handles your data can be found here: [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data storage and privacy](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/data-storage-privacy).

File information sent by Safe Documents isn't retained in Defender for Endpoint beyond the time needed for analysis (typically, less than 24 hours).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to configure Safe Documents

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to the **Safe Attachments** page at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & Collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Safe Attachments** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Safe Attachments** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2>.

2. On the **Safe Attachments** page, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Global settings**.

3. In the **Global settings** flyout that opens, confirm or configure the following settings:
   - **Turn on Safe Documents for Office clients**: Move the toggle to the right to turn on the feature: :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.
   - **Allow people to click through Protected View even if Safe Documents identified the file as malicious**: We recommend that you leave this option turned off :::image type="icon" source="../../media/scc-toggle-off.png" border="false":::.

   When you're finished in the **Global settings** flyout, select **Save**.

### Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure Safe Documents

If you'd rather user PowerShell to configure Safe Documents, use the following syntax in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):

```powershell
Set-AtpPolicyForO365 -EnableSafeDocs <$true | $false> -AllowSafeDocsOpen <$true | $false>
```

- The _EnableSafeDocs_ parameter enables or disables Safe Documents for the entire organization.
- The _AllowSafeDocsOpen_ parameter allows or prevents users from leaving Protected View (that is, opening the document) if the document has been identified as malicious.

This example enables Safe Documents for the entire organization, and prevents users from opening documents that have been identified as malicious from Protected View.

```powershell
Set-AtpPolicyForO365 -EnableSafeDocs $true -AllowSafeDocsOpen $false
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-AtpPolicyForO365](/powershell/module/exchange/set-atppolicyforo365).

### Configure individual access to Safe Documents

If you want to selectively allow or block access to the Safe Documents feature, follow these steps:

1. Turn on Safe Documents in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or Exchange Online PowerShell as previously described in this article.
2. Use Azure AD PowerShell to disable Safe Documents for specific users as described in [Disable specific Microsoft 365 services for specific users for a specific licensing plan](/microsoft-365/enterprise/disable-access-to-services-with-microsoft-365-powershell#disable-specific-microsoft-365-services-for-specific-users-for-a-specific-licensing-plan).

  The name of the service plan to disable in PowerShell is **SAFEDOCS**.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [View Microsoft 365 licenses and services with PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-licenses-and-services-with-microsoft-365-powershell)
- [View Microsoft 365 account license and service details with PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-account-license-and-service-details-with-microsoft-365-powershell)
- [Product names and service plan identifiers for licensing](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-service-plan-reference)

### Onboard to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service to enable auditing capabilities

To enable auditing capabilities, the local device needs to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installed. To deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you need to go through the various phases of deployment. After onboarding, you can configure auditing capabilities in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

To learn more, see [Onboard to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/onboarding). If you need help, see [Troubleshoot Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding issues](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-onboarding).

### How do I know this procedure worked?

To verify that you've enabled and configured Safe Documents, do any of the following steps:

- In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to the **Safe Attachments** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2>, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Global settings**, and verify the **Turn on Safe Documents for Office clients** and **Allow people to click through Protected View even if Safe Documents identifies the file as malicious** settings.

- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell and verify the property values:

  ```powershell
  Get-AtpPolicyForO365 | Format-List *SafeDocs*
  ```

- The following files are available to test Safe Documents protection. These files are similar to the EICAR.TXT file for testing anti-malware and anti-virus solutions. The files aren't harmful, but they trigger Safe Documents protection.
