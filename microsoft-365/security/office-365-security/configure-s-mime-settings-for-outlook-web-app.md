# Configure S/MIME settings in Exchange Online for Outlook on the web

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](office-365-atp.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../mtp/microsoft-threat-protection.md)

As an admin for Exchange Online, you can set up Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to allow sending and receiving S/MIME-protected messages. Use the **Get-SmimeConfig** and **Set-SmimeConfig** cmdlets to view and manage this feature in Exchange Online PowerShell. To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-SmimeConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/get-smimeconfig) and [Set-SmimeConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/set-smimeconfig).

## Considerations for new Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)

To use S/MIME in Outlook on the web in the new [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) web browser, you (or another admin) must set and configure the Microsoft Edge browser policy named **ExtensionInstallForcelist** to install the Microsoft S/MIME extension in the new Microsoft Edge. The policy value is `maafgiompdekodanheihhgilkjchcakm;https://outlook.office.com/owa/SmimeCrxUpdate.ashx`. And note that applying this policy requires domain-joined or Azure AD-joined devices, so using S/MIME in the new Microsoft Edge browser effectively requires domain-joined or Azure AD-joined devices.

For details about the **ExtensionInstallForcelist** policy, see [ExtensionInstallForcelist](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#extensioninstallforcelist).

This step is a prerequisite for using new Microsoft Edge; it does not replace the S/MIME control that's installed by users. Users are prompted to download and install the S/MIME control in Outlook on the web during their first use of S/MIME. Or, users can proactively go to **S/MIME** in their Outlook on the web settings to get the download link for the control.

## Considerations for Chrome

To use S/MIME in Outlook on the web in the Google Chrome web browser, you (or another admin) must set and configure the Chromium policy named **ExtensionInstallForcelist** to install the Microsoft S/MIME extension in Chrome. The policy value is `maafgiompdekodanheihhgilkjchcakm;https://outlook.office.com/owa/SmimeCrxUpdate.ashx`. And note that applying this policy requires domain-joined computers, so using S/MIME in Chrome effectively requires domain-joined computers.

For details about the **ExtensionInstallForcelist** policy, see [ExtensionInstallForcelist](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionInstallForcelist).

This step is a prerequisite for using Chrome; it does not replace the S/MIME control that's installed by users. Users are prompted to download and install the S/MIME control in Outlook on the web during their first use of S/MIME. Or, users can proactively go to **S/MIME** in their Outlook on the web settings to get the download link for the control.
