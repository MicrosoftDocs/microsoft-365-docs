# Configure S/MIME settings in Exchange Online for Outlook on the web

As an admin for Exchange Online, you can set up Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to allow sending and receiving S/MIME-protected messages. Use the **Get-SmimeConfig** and **Set-SmimeConfig** cmdlets to view and manage this feature in Exchange Online PowerShell. To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554).

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-SmimeConfig](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/4b29fa89-0840-4fe9-8885-019fcef2e02b.aspx) and [Set-SmimeConfig](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/de357ce0-8143-4c36-8032-026292fc63f0.aspx).

## Considerations for Chrome

To use S/MIME in Outlook on the web in the Google Chrome web browser, you (or another admin) must set and configure the Chromium policy named **ExtensionInstallForcelist** to install the Microsoft S/MIME extension in Chrome. The policy value is `maafgiompdekodanheihhgilkjchcakm;https://outlook.office.com/owa/SmimeCrxUpdate.ashx`. And note that applying this policy requires domain-joined computers, so using S/MIME in Chrome effectively requires domain-joined computers.

For details about the **ExtensionInstallForcelist** policy, see [ExtensionInstallForcelist](https://dev.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#ExtensionInstallForcelist).

This step is a prerequisite for using Chrome; it does not replace the S/MIME control that's installed by users. Users are prompted to download and install the S/MIME control in Outlook on the web during their first use of S/MIME. Or, users can proactively go to **S/MIME** in their Outlook on the web settings to get the download link for the control.
