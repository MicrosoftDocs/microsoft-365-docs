# Mail loop insight

A mail loop is bad because it wastes system resources, consumes your organization's mail volume quota, and sends confusing non-delivery reports (also known as NDRs or bounce messages) to the original senders. This insight reports when a mail loop is found in your organization, the email domains that are involved in the loop, and the number of messages from the previous day that were in the loop.
