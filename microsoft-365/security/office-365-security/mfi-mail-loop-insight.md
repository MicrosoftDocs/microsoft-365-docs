# Fix possible mail loop insight in the Security & Compliance Center

A mail loop is bad because it wastes system resources, consumes your organization's mail volume quota, and sends confusing non-delivery reports (also known as NDRs or bounce messages) to the original senders.

The **Fix possible mail loop** insight in the **Recommended for you** area of the [Mail flow dashboard](mail-flow-insights-v2.md) in the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com) notifies you when a mail loop is detected in your organization. This insight appears only after the condition is detected (if you don't have any mail loops, you won't see the insight).

When you click **View details** on the widget, a flyout appears with more information:

- **Domain**
- **Number of messages**: You can click **View sample messages** to see the [message trace](message-trace-scc.md) results for a sample of the messages that were affected by the loop.
- **Domain type**" For example, Authoritative or Non-authoritative.
- **MX record**: The host (**Mail server**) and **Priority** values of the MX record for the domain.
- **Loop reason** and **How to fix**: We'll try to identify the most common mail loop scenarios and provide the recommended actions (if available) to fix the loop.
