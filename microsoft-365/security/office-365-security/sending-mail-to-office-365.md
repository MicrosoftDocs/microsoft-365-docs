# Sending mail to Office 365

These articles help external senders improve their reputation and increase their ability to deliver email to users in Office 365. They also provide some information about how you can report junk email and phishing attempts even if you aren't an Office 365 user yourself.

If you are not an Office 365 customer, but are trying to send mail to someone in who is, you are in the right place. If you are an Office 365 administrator and you need help fighting spam, this is not the right section for you. Instead, go to [Anti-spam and anti-malware protection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/93c6c227-7442-4293-b64d-ec8f15c928db.aspx).
