## Mailflow status report

The **Mailflow status report** is a smart report that shows information about incoming and outgoing email, spam detections, malware, email identified as "good", and information about email allowed or blocked on the edge. This is the only report that contains edge protection information, and shows just how much email is blocked before being allowed into the service for evaluation by Exchange Online Protection (EOP). It's important to understand that if a message is sent to five recipients we count it as five different messages and not one message.

To view the report in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. On the **Email & collaboration reports** page, find **Mailflow status summary** and then click **View details**. To go directly to the report, open <https://security.microsoft.com/reports/mailflowStatusReport>.

## Threat protection status report

The **Threat protection status** report is available in both EOP and Defender for Office 365; however, the reports contain different data. For example, EOP customers can view information about malware detected in email, but not information about malicious files detected by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md).

The report provides the count of email messages with malicious content, such as files or website addresses (URLs) that were blocked by the anti-malware engine, [zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)](zero-hour-auto-purge.md), and Defender for Office 365 features like [Safe Links](safe-links.md), [Safe Attachments](safe-attachments.md), and [impersonation protection features in anti-phishing policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#exclusive-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365). You can use this information to identify trends or determine whether organization policies need adjustment.

**Note**: It's important to understand that if a message is sent to five recipients we count it as five different messages and not one message.

To view the report in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. On the **Email & collaboration reports** page, find **Threat protection status** and then click **View details**. To go directly to the report, open one of the following URLs:

- Defender for Office 365: <https://security.microsoft.com/reports/TPSAggregateReportATP>
- EOP: <https://security.microsoft.com/reports/TPSAggregateReport>

![Threat protection status widget on the Email & collaboration reports page.](../../media/threat-protection-status-report-widget.png)

By default, the chart shows data for the past 7 days. If you click **Filter** on the **Threat protection status report** page, you can select a 90 day date range (trial subscriptions might be limited to 30 days). The details table allows filtering for 30 days.
