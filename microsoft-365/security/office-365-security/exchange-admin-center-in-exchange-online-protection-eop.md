### Feature Pane

This is the first level of navigation for most of the tasks you'll perform in the EAC. The feature pane is organized by feature areas.

- **Recipients**: This is where you'll view groups and external contacts.

- **Permissions**: This where you'll manage admin roles.

- **Compliance Management**: This is where you'll find the administrator role group report and the admin audit log report.

- **Protection**: This is where you can manage anti-malware policies, the default connection filter policy, and DKIM.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You should manage anti-malware policies and the default connection filter policy in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Configure anti-malware policies in EOP](configure-anti-malware-policies.md) and [Configure connection filtering in EOP](configure-the-connection-filter-policy.md).

- **Mail Flow**: This is where you'll manage mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), accepted domains, and connectors, as well as where you can go to run message trace.

- **Hybrid**: This is where you can run the [Hybrid Configuration Wizard](/Exchange/hybrid-configuration-wizard), and where you can install the [Exchange Online PowerShell module](/powershell/exchange/mfa-connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

### Tabs

The tabs are your second level of navigation. Each of the feature areas contains various tabs, each representing a feature.

### Toolbar

When you click most tabs, you'll see a toolbar. The toolbar has icons that perform a specific action. The following table describes the icons and their actions.

****

### List View

When you select a tab, in most cases you'll see a list view. The viewable limit with the EAC list view is approximately 10,000 objects. In addition, paging is included so that you can page to results.

### Details Pane

When you select an object from the list view, information about that object is displayed in the details pane. In some cases the details pane includes management tasks.

### Me tile and Help

The **Me** tile allows you to sign out the EAC and sign in as a different user. From the **Help**![Help Icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-HelpIcon.gif) drop-down menu, you can do the following actions:

- **Help**: Click ![Help Icon](../../media/ITPro-EAC-HelpIcon.gif) to view the online help content.
- **Feedback**: Leave feedback.
- **Community**: Post a question for find answers in the community forums.
- **Disable Help bubble**: The Help bubble displays contextual help for fields when you create or edit an object. You can turn off the Help bubble or turn it on if it has been disabled.
- **Show Command Logging**: A new window opens that shows the equivalent PowerShell commands based on what you configured in EAC.
