# Exchange admin center in Exchange Online Protection

The Exchange admin center (EAC) is the web-based management console for Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

Looking for the Exchange Server version of this topic? See [Exchange admin center in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/architecture/client-access/exchange-admin-center).

Looking for the Exchange Online version of this topic? See [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/exchange-admin-center).

## Accessing the EAC

In most cases, EOP customers will access the EAC through the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can find a link to EOP in the drop-down menu in the **Admin** tile, which is next to the **Me** tile. Click the **Admin** tile and select **Exchange Online Protection** from the drop down menu to be taken to the EAC.

You can also access the EAC sign in page directly via the following URL: `https://admin.protection.outlook.com/ecp/<companydomain>`. For example, `https://admin.protection.outlook.com/ecp/contoso.onmicrosoft.com`. After specifying your user credentials you will be taken directly into the EAC.

## Common user interface elements in the EAC

This section describes the user interface elements that are found in the EAC.

### Feature Pane

This is the first level of navigation for most of the tasks you'll perform in the EAC. The feature pane is organized by feature areas.

1. **Recipients**: This is where you'll view internal users and external contacts.

2. **Permissions**: This where you'll manage administrator roles.

3. **Compliance Management**: This is where you'll find audit logs and reports, such as the administrator role group report.

5. **Mail Flow**: This is where you'll manage rules, accepted domains, and connectors, as well as where you'll go to perform message trace.

### Tabs

The tabs are your second level of navigation. Each of the feature areas contains various tabs, each representing a feature.

### Toolbar

When you click most tabs, you'll see a toolbar. The toolbar has icons that perform a specific action. The following table describes the icons and their actions.
