## Mailflow status report

The **Mailflow status report** is similar to the [Sent and received email report](#sent-and-received-email-report), with additional information about email allowed or blocked on the edge. This is the only report that contains edge protection information, and shows just how much email is blocked before being allowed into the service for evaluation by Exchange Online Protection (EOP). It's important to understand that if a message is sent to five recipients we count it as five different messages and not one message.
To view the report, open the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** and select **Mailflow status report**. To go directly to the **Mail flow status report**, open <https://protection.office.com/mailflowStatusReport>.

![Mailflow status report widget in the Reports dashboard](../../media/mail-flow-status-report-widget.png)

### Type view for the Mailflow status report

When you open the report, the **Type** tab is selected by default. By default, this view contains a chart and a data table that's configured with the following filters:

- **Date**: The last 7 days.
- **Direction**:

  - **Inbound**
  - **Outbound**
  - **Intra-org**: this count is for messages within a tenant i.e sender abc@domain.com sends to recipient xyz@domain.com  (counted separately from **Inbound** and **Outbound**)

- **Type**:

  - **Good mail**
  - **Malware**
  - **Spam**
  - **Edge protection**
  - **Rule messages**
  - **Phishing email**

The chart is organized by the **Type** values.

You can change these filters by clicking **Filter** or by clicking a value in the chart legend.

The data table contains the following information:

- **Direction**
- **Type**
- **24 hours**
- **3 days**
- **7 days**
- **15 days**
- **30 days**

If you click **Choose a category for more details**, you can select from the following values:

- **Phishing email**: This selection takes you to the [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report).
- **Malware in email**: This selection takes you to the [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report).

- **Edge blocked spam**: This selection takes you to the [Spam Detections report](view-email-security-reports.md#spam-detections-report).

**Export**:

For the detail view, you can only export data for one day. So, if you want to export data for 7 days, you need to do 7 different export actions.

Each exported .csv file is limited to 150,000 rows. If the data for that day contains more than 150,000 rows, then multiple .csv files will be created.

![Type view in the Mailflow status report ](../../media/mail-flow-status-report-type-view.png)

### Direction view for the Mailflow status report

If you click the **Direction** tab, the same default filters from the **Type** view are used.

The chart is organized by **Direction** values.

You can change these filters by clicking **Filter** or by clicking a value in the chart legend. The same filters from the **Type** view are used.

The data table contains same information from the **Type** view.

The **Choose a category for more details** available selections and behavior are the same as the **Type** view.

**Export**:

For the detail view, you can only export data for one day. So, if you want to export data for 7 days, you need to do 7 different export actions.

### Funnel view for the Mailflow status report

The **Funnel** view shows you how Microsoft's email threat protection features filter incoming and outgoing email in your organization. It provides details on the total email count, and how the configured threat protection features, including edge protection, anti-malware, anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-spoofing affect this count.

If you click the **Funnel** tab, by default, this view contains a chart and a data table that's configured with the following filters:

- **Direction**:

  - **Inbound**
  - **Outbound**
  - **Intra-org**: This count is for messages sent within a tenant; i.e, sender abc@domain.com sends to recipient xyz@domain.com (counted separately from Inbound and Outbound).

The aggregate view and data table view allow for 90 days of filtering.

If you click **Filter**, you can filter both the chart and the data table.

This chart shows the email count organized by:

- **Total email**
- **Email after edge protection**
