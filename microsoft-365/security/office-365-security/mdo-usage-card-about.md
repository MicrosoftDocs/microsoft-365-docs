### I have Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 paid license. Why can I not see the usage card?

If you have at least one Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 license, but you're still unable to see the card because of one of the following reasons:

- You don't have the required role to be able to view the card.
- Your organization had no active usage in the past 28 days.

### What does Collecting license and usage data status mean?

If you see **Collecting license and usage data** status in your usage card, it means Microsoft is still collecting your current licensing and usage data. When it's available, you can see the full usage card and other details.

### Why does it still show overage even though you don't have any Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 license and no usage of SecOps capabilities?
