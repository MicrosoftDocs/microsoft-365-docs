# Report messages and files to Microsoft

Users and admins in organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes to submit email messages have several different methods for reporting messages and files to Microsoft.

|||
|---|---|
|**Method**|**Description**|
|[Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md)|This is the recommended reporting method for admins in organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes (not available in standalone EOP).|
|[Enable the Report Message add-in in Office 365](enable-the-report-message-add-in.md)|Works with Outlook, Outlook for Mac, and Outlook on the web. This is the recommended add-in. <br/><br/> Depending on your license, the reported messages are available in [Automated investigation and response (AIR) results](air-view-investigation-results.md), the [User-reported messages report](view-email-security-reports.md#user-reported-messages-report) and [Threat Explorer](threat-explorer-views.md#email--submissions).|
|[Install and use the Junk Email Reporting add-in for Microsoft Outlook in Office 365](junk-email-reporting-add-in-for-microsoft-outlook.md)|Only works in Outlook.|
|[Report junk and phishing email in Outlook on the web in Office 365](report-junk-email-and-phishing-scams-in-outlook-on-the-web-eop.md)|Use the built-in capabilities in Outlook on the web for organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes (not available in standalone EOP).|
|[Submit malware and non-malware to Microsoft for analysis](submitting-malware-and-non-malware-to-microsoft-for-analysis.md)|Use the Microsoft Security Intelligence site to submit attachments and other files.|
|

If the spam or phishing messages were quarantined instead of delivered, users can report the messages to Microsoft from the Quarantine portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For details, see [Find and release quarantined messages as a user in Office 365](find-and-release-quarantined-messages-as-a-user.md).
