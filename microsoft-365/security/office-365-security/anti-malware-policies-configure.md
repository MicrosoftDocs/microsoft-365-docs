# Configure anti-malware policies in EOP

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, email messages are automatically protected against malware by EOP. EOP uses anti-malware policies for malware protection settings. For more information, see [Anti-malware protection](anti-malware-protection-about.md).

The default anti-malware policy automatically applies to all recipients. For greater granularity, you can also create custom anti-malware policies that apply to specific users, groups, or domains in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The default anti-malware policy applies to inbound and outbound email. Custom anti-malware policies apply to inbound email only. 

You can configure anti-malware policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. To go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2>.

- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Microsoft 365 Defender role based access control (RBAC)](/microsoft-365/security/defender/manage-rbac): **configuration/security (manage)** or **configuration/security (read)**. Currently, this option requires membership in the Microsoft 365 Defender Preview program.
  - [Exchange Online RBAC](/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo):
    - _Add, modify, and delete policies_: Membership in the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
    - _Read-only access to policies_: Membership in the **Global Reader**, **Security Reader**, or **View-Only Organization Management** role groups.
  - [Azure AD RBAC](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, **Global Reader**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

- For our recommended settings for anti-malware policies, see [EOP anti-malware policy settings](recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.md#eop-anti-malware-policy-settings).

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create anti-malware policies

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & Collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-Malware** in the **Policies** section. To go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2>.

2. On the **Anti-malware** page, click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Create** to open the new anti-malware policy wizard.

3. On the **Name your policy** page, configure these settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the policy.
   - **Description**: Enter an optional description for the policy.

   When you're finished on the **Name your policy** page, click **Next**.

4. On the **Users and domains** page, identify the internal recipients that the policy applies to (recipient conditions):
   - **Users**: The specified mailboxes, mail users, or mail contacts.
   - **Groups**:
     - Members of the specified distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups (dynamic distribution groups aren't supported).
     - The specified Microsoft 365 Groups.
   - **Domains**: All recipients in the specified [accepted domains](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains) in your organization.

   Click in the appropriate box, start typing a value, and select the value that you want from the results. Repeat this process as many times as necessary. To remove an existing value, click remove :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the value.

   For users or groups, you can use most identifiers (name, display name, alias, email address, account name, etc.), but the corresponding display name is shown in the results. For users or groups, enter an asterisk (\*) by itself to see all available values.

   Multiple values in the same condition use OR logic (for example, _\<recipient1\>_ or _\<recipient2\>_). Different conditions use AND logic (for example, _\<recipient1\>_ and _\<member of group 1\>_).

   - **Exclude these users, groups, and domains**: To add exceptions for the internal recipients that the policy applies to (recipient exceptions), select this option and configure the exceptions. The settings and behavior are exactly like the conditions.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Multiple different types of conditions or exceptions are not additive; they're inclusive. The policy is applied _only_ to those recipients that match _all_ of the specified recipient filters. For example, you configure a recipient filter condition in the policy with the following values:
   >
   > - Users: romain@contoso.com
   > - Groups: Executives
   >
   > The policy is applied to romain@contoso.com _only_ if he's also a member of the Executives group. If he's not a member of the group, then the policy is not applied to him.
   >
   > Likewise, if you use the same recipient filter as an exception to the policy, the policy is not applied to romain@contoso.com _only_ if he's also a member of the Executives group. If he's not a member of the group, then the policy still applies to him.

   When you're finished on the **Users and domains** page, click **Next**.

5. On the **Protection settings** page, configure the following settings:

   - **Protection settings** section:

     - **Enable the common attachments filter**: If you select this option, messages with the specified attachments are treated as malware and are automatically quarantined. You can modify the list by clicking **Customize file types** and selecting or deselecting values in the list.

       For the default and available values, see [Anti-malware policies](anti-malware-protection-about.md#anti-malware-policies).

       **When these types are found**: Select one of the following values:

       - **Reject the message with a non-delivery report (NDR)** (this is the default value)
       - **Quarantine the message**

     - **Enable zero-hour auto purge for malware**: If you select this option, ZAP quarantines malware messages that have already been delivered. For more information, see [Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in Exchange Online](zero-hour-auto-purge.md).

     - **Quarantine policy**: Select the quarantine policy that applies to messages that are quarantined as malware. By default, the quarantine policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy is used for malware detections. For more information about this quarantine policy, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](quarantine-policies.md#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

       > [!NOTE]
       > Quarantine notifications are disabled in the policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy. To notify recipients that have messages quarantined as malware, create or use an existing quarantine policy where quarantine notifications are turned on. For instructions, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](quarantine-policies.md#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal).
       >
       > Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware messages.

   - **Notifications** section:

     - **Admin notifications** section: Select none, one, or both of the following options:

       - **Notify an admin about undelivered messages from internal senders**: If you select this option, enter a recipient email address in the **Admin email address** box that appears.
       - **Notify an admin about undelivered messages from external senders**: If you select this option, enter a recipient email address in the **Admin email address** box that appears.

       > [!NOTE]
       > Admin notifications are sent only for _attachments_ that are classified as malware.

     - **Customize notifications** section: Use the settings in this section to customize the message properties that are used for admin notifications.

         - **Use customized notification text**: If you select this option, use the **From name** and **From address** boxes that appear to specify the sender's name and email address for admin notification messages.

         - **Customize notifications for messages from internal senders** section: If you previously selected **Notify an admin about undelivered messages from internal senders**, use the **Subject** and **Message** boxes that appear in this section to specify the subject and message body of admin notification messages.

         - **Customize notifications for messages from external senders** section: If you previously selected **Notify an admin about undelivered messages from external senders**, use the **Subject** and **Message** boxes that appear in this section to specify the subject and message body of admin notification messages.

   When you're finished on the **Protection settings** page, click **Next**.

6. On the **Review** page, review your settings. You can select **Edit** in each section to modify the settings within the section. Or you can click **Back** or select the specific page in the wizard.

   When you're finished on the **Review** page, click **Submit**.

7. On the **Created new anti-malware policy** page, you can click the links to view the policy, view anti-malware policies, and learn more about anti-malware policies.

   When you're done on the **Created new anti-malware policy** page, click **Done**.

   Back on the **Anti-malware** page, the policy new policy is listed.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to view anti-malware policy details

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & Collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-Malware** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2>.

On the **Anti-malware** page, the following properties are displayed in the list of anti-malware policies:

- **Name**
- **Status**: Values are **On** (enabled or **Off** (disabled).
- **Priority**: For more information, see the [Set the priority of custom anti-malware policies](#set-the-priority-of-custom-anti-malware-policies) section.

To change the list of policies from normal to compact spacing, click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-standard-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change list spacing to compact or normal**, and then select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-compact-icon.png" border="false":::.

Use the ![Search icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png) **Search** box and a corresponding value to find specific anti-malware policies.

Use :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to export the list of policies to a CSV file.

Select a policy by clicking anywhere other than the check box next to the name to open the details flyout for the policy.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to take action on anti-malware policies

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & Collaboration** \> **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-Malware** in the **Policies** section. To go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2>.

2. On the **Anti-malware** page, select the anti-malware policy by using either of the following methods:

   - Select the policy from the list by selecting the check box next to the name. The following actions are available in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More actions** drop down list that appears:
     - **Enable selected policies**.
     - **Disable selected policies**.
     - **Delete selected policies**.

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/anti-malware-policies-main-page.png" alt-text="The Anti-malware page with a policy select and the More actions control expanded." lightbox="../../media/anti-malware-policies-main-page.png":::

   - Select the policy from the list by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. Some or all following actions are available in the details flyout that opens:
     - Modify policy settings by clicking **Edit** in each section (custom policies or the default policy)
     - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-turn-on-off-icon.png" border="false"::: **Turn on** or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-turn-on-off-icon.png" border="false"::: **Turn off** (custom policies only)
     - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete policy** (custom policies only)
     - :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-increase-icon.png" border="false"::: **Increase priority** or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-decrease-icon.png" border="false"::: **Decrease priority** (custom policies only)

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/anti-malware-policies-details-flyout.png" alt-text="The details flyout of a custom anti-malware policy." lightbox="../../media/anti-malware-policies-details-flyout.png":::

The actions are described in the following subsections.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify anti-malware policies

After you select the default anti-malware policy or a custom policy by clicking anywhere other than the checkbox next to the name, the policy settings are shown in the details flyout that opens. Click **Edit** in each section to modify the settings within the section. For more information about the settings, see the [Create anti-malware policies](#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-anti-malware-policies) section earlier in this article.

For the anti-malware policies named **Standard Preset Security Policy** and **Strict Preset Security Policy** that are associated with [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md), you can't modify the policy settings in the details flyout. You can click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **View preset security policies** in the details flyout to go to the **Preset security policies** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/presetSecurityPolicies> to modify the preset security policies.

### Enable or disable custom anti-malware policies

You can't disable the default anti-malware policy (it's always enabled).

You can't enable or disable the anti-malware policies that are associated with Standard and Strict preset security policies. You enable or disable the Standard or Strict preset security policies on the **Preset security policies** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/presetSecurityPolicies>.

After you select an enabled custom anti-malware policy (the **Status** value is **On**), use either of the following methods to disable it:

- **On the Anti-malware page**: Click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More actions** \> **Disable selected policies**.
- **In the details flyout of the policy**: Click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-turn-on-off-icon.png" border="false"::: **Turn off** at the top of the flyout.

After you select a disabled custom anti-malware policy (the **Status** value is **Off**), use either of the following methods to enable it:

- **On the Anti-malware page**: Click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More actions** \> **Enable selected policies**.
- **In the details flyout of the policy**: Click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-turn-on-off-icon.png" border="false"::: **Turn on** at the top of the flyout.

On the **Anti-malware** page, the **Status** value of the policy changes to **On** or **Off**.

### Set the priority of custom anti-malware policies

Anti-malware policies are processed in the order that they're displayed on the **Anti-malware** page:

- The anti-malware policy named **Strict Preset Security Policy** that's associated with the Strict preset security policy is always applied first (if the Strict preset security policy is [enabled](preset-security-policies.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users)).
- The anti-malware policy named **Standard Preset Security Policy** that's associated with the Standard preset security policy is always applied next (if the Standard preset security policy is [enabled](preset-security-policies.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users)).
- Custom anti-malware policies are applied next in priority order (if they're enabled):
  - A lower priority value indicates a higher priority (0 is the highest).
  - By default, a new policy is created with a priority that's lower than the lowest existing custom policy (the first is 0, the next is 1, etc.).
  - No two policies can have the same priority value.
- The default anti-malware policy always has the priority value **Lowest**, and you can't change it.

Anti-malware protection stops for a recipient after the first policy is applied. For more information, see [Order and precedence of email protection](how-policies-and-protections-are-combined.md).

After you select the custom anti-malware policy by clicking anywhere other than the check box next to the name, you can increase or decrease the priority of the policy in the details flyout that opens:

- The custom policy with the **Priority** value **0** on the **Anti-malware** page has the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-decrease-icon.png" border="false"::: **Decrease priority** action at the top of the details flyout.
- The custom policy with the lowest **Priority** value (for example, **3**) has the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-increase-icon.png" border="false"::: **Increase priority** action at the top of the details flyout.
- If you have three or more policies, the policies between the highest and lowest priority values have both the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-increase-icon.png" border="false"::: **Increase priority** and the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-decrease-icon.png" border="false"::: **Decrease priority** actions at the top of the details flyout.

When you're finished in the policy details flyout, click **Close**.

Back on the **Anti-malware** page, the order of the policy in the list matches the updated **Priority** value.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to delete custom anti-malware policies

You can't remove the default anti-malware policy or the anti-malware policies named **Standard Preset Security Policy** and **Strict Preset Security Policy** that are associated with [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md).

After you select the custom anti-malware policy, use either of the following methods to remove it:

- **On the Anti-malware page**: Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More actions** \> **Delete selected policies**.
- **In the details flyout of the policy**: Click :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-delete-icon.png" border="false"::: **Delete policy** at the top of the flyout.

On the **Anti-malware** page, the deleted policy is no longer listed.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone EOP PowerShell to configure anti-malware policies

For more information about anti-spam policies in PowerShell, see [Anti-malware policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal vs PowerShell](anti-malware-protection-about.md#anti-malware-policies-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-vs-powershell).

### Use PowerShell to create anti-malware policies

Creating an anti-malware policy in PowerShell is a two-step process:

1. Create the malware filter policy.
2. Create the malware filter rule that specifies the malware filter policy that the rule applies to.

 **Notes**:

- You can create a new malware filter rule and assign an existing, unassociated malware filter policy to it. A malware filter rule can't be associated with more than one malware filter policy.
- There are two settings that you can configure on new anti-malware policies in PowerShell that aren't available in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal until after you create the policy:
  - Create the new policy as disabled (_Enabled_ `$false` on the **New-MalwareFilterRule** cmdlet).
  - Set the priority of the policy during creation (_Priority_ _\<Number\>_) on the **New-MalwareFilterRule** cmdlet).
- A new malware filter policy that you create in PowerShell isn't visible in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal until you assign the policy to a malware filter rule.

#### Step 1: Use PowerShell to create a malware filter policy

To create a malware filter policy, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Name "<PolicyName>" [-AdminDisplayName "<OptionalComments>"] [-EnableFileFilter <$true | $false>] [-FileTypeAction <Reject | Quarantine>] [-FileTypes FileType1,FileType2,...FileTypeN] [-CustomNotifications <$true | $false>] [<Inbound notification options>] [<Outbound notification options>]  [-QuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>]
```

This example creates a new malware filter policy named Contoso Malware Filter Policy with these settings:

- Notify admin@contoso.com when malware is detected in a message from an internal sender.
- The common attachments filter is enabled (`-EnableFileFilter $true`) and the default list of file types is used (we aren't using the _FileTypes_ parameter).
- Messages detected by the common attachments filter are rejected with an NDR (we aren't using the _FileTypeAction_ parameter, and the default value is `Reject`).
- The default quarantine policy for malware detections is used (we aren't using the _QuarantineTag_ parameter).

```PowerShell
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Name "Contoso Malware Filter Policy" -EnableFileFilter $true -EnableInternalSenderAdminNotifications $true -InternalSenderAdminAddress admin@contoso.com
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-malwarefilterpolicy).

#### Step 2: Use PowerShell to create a malware filter rule

To create a malware filter rule, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
New-MalwareFilterRule -Name "<RuleName>" -MalwareFilterPolicy "<PolicyName>" <Recipient filters> [<Recipient filter exceptions>] [-Comments "<OptionalComments>"]
```

This example creates a new malware filter rule named Contoso Recipients with these settings:

- The malware filter policy named Contoso Malware Filter Policy is associated with the rule.
- The rule applies to recipients in the contoso.com domain.

```PowerShell
New-MalwareFilterRule -Name "Contoso Recipients" -MalwareFilterPolicy "Contoso Malware Filter Policy" -RecipientDomainIs contoso.com
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MalwareFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/new-malwarefilterrule).

### Use PowerShell to view malware filter policies

To return a summary list of all malware filter policies, run this command:

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterPolicy
```

To return detailed information about a specific malware filter policy, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "<PolicyName>" | Format-List [<Specific properties to view>]
```

This example returns all the property values for the malware filter policy named Executives.

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "Executives" | Format-List
```

This example returns only the specified properties for the same policy.

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "Executives" | Format-List Action,AdminDisplayName,CustomNotifications,Enable*Notifications
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/get-malwarefilterpolicy).

### Use PowerShell to view malware filter rules

To return a summary list of all malware filter rules, run this command:

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule
```

To filter the list by enabled or disabled rules, run the following commands:

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule -State Disabled
```

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule -State Enabled
```

To return detailed information about a specific malware filter rule, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "<RuleName>" | Format-List [<Specific properties to view>]
```

This example returns all the property values for the malware filter rule named Executives.

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "Executives" | Format-List
```

This example returns only the specified properties for the same rule.

```PowerShell
Get-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "Executives" | Format-List Name,Priority,State,MalwareFilterPolicy,*Is,*SentTo,*MemberOf
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MalwareFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/get-malwarefilterrule).

### Use PowerShell to modify malware filter policies

Other than the following items, the same settings are available when you modify a malware filter policy in PowerShell as when you create the policy as described in the [Step 1: Use PowerShell to create a malware filter policy](#step-1-use-powershell-to-create-a-malware-filter-policy) section earlier in this article.

- The _MakeDefault_ switch that turns the specified policy into the default policy (applied to everyone, unmodifiable **Lowest** priority, and you can't delete it) is only available when you modify a malware filter policy in PowerShell.
- You can't rename a malware filter policy (the **Set-MalwareFilterPolicy** cmdlet has no _Name_ parameter). When you rename an anti-malware policy in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you're only renaming the malware filter _rule_.

To modify a malware filter policy, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
Set-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "<PolicyName>" <Settings>
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-malwarefilterpolicy).

> [!TIP]
> For detailed instructions to specify the quarantine policy to use in a malware filter policy, see [Use PowerShell to specify the quarantine policy in anti-malware policies](quarantine-policies.md#anti-malware-policies-in-powershell).

### Use PowerShell to modify malware filter rules

The only setting that isn't available when you modify a malware filter rule in PowerShell is the _Enabled_ parameter that allows you to create a disabled rule. To enable or disable existing malware filter rules, see the next section.

Otherwise, no additional settings are available when you modify a malware filter rule in PowerShell. The same settings are available when you create a rule as described in the [Step 2: Use PowerShell to create a malware filter rule](#step-2-use-powershell-to-create-a-malware-filter-rule) section earlier in this article.

To modify a malware filter rule, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
Set-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "<RuleName>" <Settings>
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-MalwareFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/set-malwarefilterrule).

### Use PowerShell to enable or disable malware filter rules

Enabling or disabling a malware filter rule in PowerShell enables or disables the whole anti-malware policy (the malware filter rule and the assigned malware filter policy). You can't enable or disable the default anti-malware policy (it's always applied to all recipients).

To enable or disable a malware filter rule in PowerShell, use this syntax:

```PowerShell
<Enable-MalwareFilterRule | Disable-MalwareFilterRule> -Identity "<RuleName>"
```

This example disables the malware filter rule named Marketing Department.

```PowerShell
Disable-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "Marketing Department"
```

This example enables same rule.

```PowerShell
Enable-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "Marketing Department"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Enable-MalwareFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/enable-malwarefilterrule) and [Disable-MalwareFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/disable-malwarefilterrule).

### Use PowerShell to set the priority of malware filter rules

The highest priority value you can set on a rule is 0. The lowest value you can set depends on the number of rules. For example, if you have five rules, you can use the priority values 0 through 4. Changing the priority of an existing rule can have a cascading effect on other rules. For example, if you have five custom rules (priorities 0 through 4), and you change the priority of a rule to 2, the existing rule with priority 2 is changed to priority 3, and the rule with priority 3 is changed to priority 4.

To set the priority of a malware filter rule in PowerShell, use the following syntax:

```PowerShell
Set-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "<RuleName>" -Priority <Number>
```

This example sets the priority of the rule named Marketing Department to 2. All existing rules that have a priority less than or equal to 2 are decreased by 1 (their priority numbers are increased by 1).

```PowerShell
Set-MalwareFilterRule -Identity "Marketing Department" -Priority 2
```

**Notes**:

- To set the priority of a new rule when you create it, use the _Priority_ parameter on the **New-MalwareFilterRule** cmdlet instead.
- The default malware filter policy doesn't have a corresponding malware filter rule, and it always has the unmodifiable priority value **Lowest**.

### Use PowerShell to remove malware filter policies

When you use PowerShell to remove a malware filter policy, the corresponding malware filter rule isn't removed.

To remove a malware filter policy in PowerShell, use this syntax:

```PowerShell

## How do you know these procedures worked?

### Use the EICAR.TXT file to verify your anti-malware policy settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The EICAR.TXT file is not a virus. The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) developed this file to safely test anti-virus installations and settings.

1. Open Notepad and paste the following text into an empty file:

   ```Text
   X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
   ```

   Be sure that these characters are the only text in the file. The file size should be 68 bytes.

2. Save the file as EICAR.TXT

   In your desktop anti-virus program, be sure to exclude the EICAR.TXT from scanning (otherwise, the file will be quarantined).

3. Send an email message that contains the EICAR.TXT file as an attachment, using an email client that won't automatically block the file, and using an email service that doesn't automatically block outbound spam. Use your anti-malware policy settings to determine the following scenarios to test:
   - Email from an internal mailbox to an internal recipient.
   - Email from an internal mailbox to an external recipient.
   - Email from an external mailbox to an internal recipient.

4. Verify that the message was quarantined, and verify the admin notification results based on your anti-malware policy settings. For example, the admin email address that you specified is notified for internal or external message senders, with the default or customized notification messages.

5. Delete the EICAR.TXT file after your testing is complete (so other users aren't unnecessarily alarmed by it).
