# Configure and review priority accounts in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md)

In every organization, there are people that are critical, like executives, leaders, managers, or other users who have access to sensitive, proprietary, or high priority information. You can tag these users within Microsoft Defender for Office 365 as priority accounts, allowing security teams to prioritize their focus on these critical individuals. With differentiated protection for priority accounts, users tagged as priority accounts will receive a higher level of protection against threats.

Priority accounts are targeted by attackers more often and are generally attacked with more sophisticated techniques. Differentiated protection for priority accounts focuses on this specific user set and provides higher level of protection using enhanced machine learning models. This differentiation in learning and message handling provides the highest level of protection for these accounts and helps maintain a low false positive rate, as a high rate of false positives can also have a negative impact on these users.

## Configure priority account protection

Priority account protection is turned on by default for pre-identified critical users. However, the security administrator of your organization can also turn on priority account protection by following these steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Settings** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Priority account protection**. 

2. Turn on **Priority account protection**.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not recommended to disable or turn off priority account protection.  

### Enable the priority account tag

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 supports priority accounts as tags that can be used as filters in alerts, reports, and investigations.

For more information, see [User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](user-tags.md).

## Review differentiated protection in Threat protection status report, Threat Explorer, and email entity page

### Threat protection status report

The Threat protection status report is a single view that brings together information about malicious content and malicious email detected and blocked by Microsoft Defender for Office 365. 

To view the report in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. On the **Email & collaboration reports** page, find **Threat protection status**, and then select **View details**. Navigate to either the **Spam view**, **Phish view**, or **Malware view**, then use the filter icon to select **Priority account protection**.

### Threat Explorer 

Context filter within Threat Explorer helps search for emails where priority account protection was involved in the detection of the message. This allows security operations teams to be able to see the value provided by this protection. You can still filter messages by priority account tag to find all messages for the specific set of users. 

To view the extra protection, in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Explorer**, select **Context** from the dropdown, and then select the checkbox next to **Priority account protection**.

### Email entity page

The email entity page is available in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com> at **Email & collaboration** \> **Explorer**. In **Explorer**, select the subject of an email you're investigating. A gold bar will display at the top of the email flyout for that mail. Select to view the new page.

The tabs along the top of the entity page will allow you to investigate email efficiently. Click the **Analysis** tab. Priority account protection is now listed under **Threat detection details**.
