## Mail latency report

The **Mail latency report** shows you an aggregate view of the mail delivery and detonation latency experienced within your organization. Mail delivery times in the service are affected by a number of factors, and the absolute delivery time in seconds is often not a good indicator of success or a problem. A slow delivery time on one day might be considered an average delivery time on another day, or vice-versa. The **Mail latency report** tries to qualify message delivery based on statistical data about the observed delivery times of other messages:

- **50th percentile**: This is the middle for message delivery times. You can consider this value as an average delivery time.
- **90th percentile**: This indicates a high latency for message delivery. Only 10% of messages took longer than this value to deliver.
- **99th percentile**: This indicates the highest latency for message delivery.

Client side and network latency are not included.

To view the report, open the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** and select **Mail latency report**. To go directly to the report, open <https://protection.office.com/mailLatencyReport?viewid=P50>.

![Mail latency report widget in the Reports dashboard](../../media/mail-latency-report-widget.png)

### Report view for the Mail latency report

When you open the report, the **50th percentiles** tab is selected by default.

By default, this view contains a chart that's configured with the following filters:

- **Date**: The last 7 days
- **Message View**:
  - Detonated messages

This chart shows messages organized into the following categories:

- **Mail delivery latency**
- **Detonation latency**

When you hover over a category in the chart, you can see a breakdown of the latency in each category.

![Mail latency report](../../media/mail-latency-report.png)

If you click **Filter** in the report view, you can modify the results with the following filters:

- All messages
- Messages that contain attachments or URLs

If you click the **90th percentiles** tab or the **99th percentiles** tab, the same default filters from the **50th percentiles** view are used.

### Details table view for the Mail latency report

The following information is shown in the details table view:

- **Date**
- **Percentiles**
- **Message count**
- **Overall latency**

![Mail latency report details](../../media/mail-latency-report-details.png)

The above shows that on November 14 the average latency experienced for all messages delivered and detonated was **108.033** seconds.

The details table contains the same information on each tab.

## Threat protection status report

The **Threat protection status** report is a single view that brings together information about malicious content and malicious email detected and blocked by [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md) (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365. For more information, see [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report).

## URL threat protection report

The **URL threat protection report** provides summary and trend views for threats detected and actions taken on URL clicks as part of [Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md). This report will not have click data from users where the Safe Links policy applied has the **Do not track user clicks** option selected.

To view the report, open the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** and select **URL protection report**. To go directly to the report, open <https://protection.office.com/reportv2?id=URLProtectionActionReport>.

![URL protection report widget in the Reports dashboard](../../media/url-protection-report-widget.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a *protection trend report*, meaning data represents trends in a larger dataset. As a result, the data in the aggregate view is not available in real time here, but the data in the details table view is, so you may see a slight discrepancy between the two views.

### Report view for the URL threat protection report

The **URL threat protection** report has two aggregated views that are refreshed once every four hours that shows data for the last 90 days:

- **URL click protection action**: Shows the number of URL clicks by users in the organization and the results of the click:

  - **Blocked** (the user was blocked from navigating to the URL)
  - **Blocked and clicked through**
  - **Clicked through during scan**

  A click indicates that the user has clicked through the block page to the malicious website (admins can disable click through in Safe Links policies).

  If you click **Filters**, you can modify the report with the following filters:

  - **Start date** and **End date**
  - The available click protection actions, plus the value **Allowed** (the user was allowed to navigate to the URL).

  ![URL click protection action view in the URL threat protection report](../../media/url-threat-protection-report-url-click-protection-action-view.png)

- **URL click by application**: Shows the number of URL clicks by applications that support Safe Links:

  - **Email client**
  - **PowerPoint**
  - **Word**
  - **Excel**
  - **OneNote**
  - **Visio**
  - **Teams**
  - **Other**

  If you click **Filters**, you can modify the report with the following filters:

  - **Start date** and **End date**
  - The available applications.

### Details table view for the URL threat protection report

If you click **View details table**, the report provides a near-real-time view of all clicks that happen within the organization for the last 7 days with the following details:

- **Click time**
- **User**
- **URL**
- **Action**
- **App**

If you click **Filters** in the details table view, you can filter by the same criteria as in the report view, and also by **Domains** or **Recipients** separated by commas.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Domains** filter refers to the URL domain listed in the report results. 

To get back to the reports view, click **View report**.
