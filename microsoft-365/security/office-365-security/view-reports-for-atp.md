# View reports for Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection

Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) organizations (for example, Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions or ATP Plan 1 or ATP Plan 2 add-ons) contain a variety of security-related reports. If you have the [necessary permissions](#what-permissions-are-needed-to-view-the-atp-reports), you can view these reports in the Security & Compliance Center by going to **Reports** \> **Dashboard**. To go directly to the Reports dashboard, open <https://protection.office.com/insightdashboard>.

## Advanced Threat Protection file types report

The **Advanced Threat Protection file types report** report shows you the type of files detected as malicious by [ATP Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md).

## Threat protection status report

The **Threat protection status** report is a single view that brings together information about malicious content and malicious email detected and blocked by [Exchange Online Protection](exchange-online-protection-overview.md) (EOP) and Office 365 ATP. For more information, see [Threat protection status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report).

## URL threat protection report

The **URL threat protection report** provides summary and trend views for threats detected and actions taken on URL clicks as part of [ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md). This report will not have click data from users where the Safe Links policy applied has the **Do not track user clicks** option selected.

To view the report, open the [Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** and select **URL protection report**. To go directly to the report, open <https://protection.office.com/reportv2?id=URLProtectionActionReport>.

![URL protection report widget in the Reports dashboard](../../media/url-protection-report-widget.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a *protection trend report*, meaning data represents trends in a larger dataset. As a result, the data in the aggregate view is not available in real time here, but the data in the details table view is, so you may see a slight discrepancy between the two views.

### Report view for the URL threat protection report

The **URL threat protection** report has two aggregated views that are refreshed once every four hours that shows data for the last 90 days:

- **URL click protection action**: Shows the number of URL clicks by users in the organization and the results of the click:

  - **Blocked** (the user was blocked from navigating to the URL)
  - **Blocked and clicked through**
  - **Clicked through during scan**

  A click indicates that the user has clicked through the block page to the malicious website (admins can disable click through in Safe Links policies).

  If you click **Filters**, you can modify the report with the following filters:

  - **Start date** and **End date**
  - The available click protection actions, plus the value **Allowed** (the user was allowed to navigate to the URL).

  ![URL click protection action view in the URL threat protection report](../../media/url-threat-protection-report-url-click-protection-action-view.png)

- **URL click by application**: Shows the number of URL clicks by applications that support Office 365 ATP Safe Links:

  - **Email client**
  - **PowerPoint**
  - **Word**
  - **Excel**
  - **OneNote**
  - **Visio**
  - **Teams**
  - **Other**

  If you click **Filters**, you can modify the report with the following filters:

  - **Start date** and **End date**
  - The available applications.

### Details table view for the URL threat protection report

If you click **View details table**, the report provides a near-real-time view of all clicks that happen within the organization for the last 7 days with the following details:

- **Click time**
- **User**
- **URL**
- **Action**
- **App**

If you click **Filters** in the details table view, you can filter by the same criteria as in the report view, and also by **Domains** or **Recipients** separated by commas.

To get back to the reports view, click **View report**.
