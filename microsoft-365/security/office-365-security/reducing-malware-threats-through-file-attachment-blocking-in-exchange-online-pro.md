# Reducing malware threats through file attachment blocking in Exchange Online Protection

Most malware that enters an environment through email does so using an executable payload attached to an email message. To reduce your risk from malware that may not be detected by Exchange Online Protection, you should enable file attachment blocking.

File attachment blocking covers file types and file name extensions, and is useful to broadly block any email with attachments. For example, following a malware outbreak, a company could apply this rule with a time limit included so that everyone affected can get back to sending attachments after a specified length of time. The following procedure explains how to reduce malware threats through file attachment blocking.
