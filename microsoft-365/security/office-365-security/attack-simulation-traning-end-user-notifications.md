# End-user notifications for Attack simulation training

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, end-user notifications are email messages that are sent to users There are two basic types of notifications:

- **Simulation notifications**: These messages are sent when users are enrolled in trainings, and as reminders for required trainings.
- **Positive reinforcement notifications**: These messages are sent when users report a simulated phishing message.

To see the available end-user notification, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, and then go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **End-user notifications** tab. To go directly to the **End-user notifications** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=endUserNotification>.

The **End-user notifications** tab has two tabs:

- **Global notifications**: Contains the built-in and non-modifiable notifications.
- **Tenant notifications**: Contains the custom notifications that you've created.

The following information is shown for each notification:

- **Notifications**: The name of the notification.
- **Language**: If the notification contains multiple translations, the first two languages are shown directly. To see the remaining languages, hover over the numeric icon (for example, **+10**).
- **Type**: The value is **Simulation notification** or **Positive reinforcement notification**.
- **Source**: For built-in notifications, the value is **Global**. For custom notifications, the value is **Tenant**.
