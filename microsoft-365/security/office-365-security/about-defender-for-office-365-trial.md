## Terms and conditions

The Defender for Office 365 trial is available for 90 days and can be initiated for all of your users. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Trial Terms & Conditions](defender-for-office-365-trial-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Set up a Defender for Office 365 trial

A trial allows organizations to easily set up and configure the Defender for Office 365 capabilities. During setup, policies that are exclusive to Defender for Office 365 (specifically, [Safe Attachments](safe-attachments.md), [Safe Links](safe-links.md), and [impersonation protection in anti-spam policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)) are applied using the Standard template for [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md).

By default, these policies are scoped to all users in the organization, but admins can customize the policies during or after setup so they apply only to specific users.

During setup, MDO response functionality (found in MDO P2 or equivalent) is also set up for the entire organization. No policy scoping is required.

## Additional information

After you enroll in the trial, it might take up to 2 hours for the changes and updates to be available. And, admins must log out and log back in to see the changes.

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the <> card.
