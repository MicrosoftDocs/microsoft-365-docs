## Set up a Defender for Office 365 trial

A trial allows organizations to easily set up and configure the Defender for Office 365 capabilities. During setup, policies that are exclusive to Defender for Office 365 (specifically, [Safe Attachments](safe-attachments.md), [Safe Links](safe-links.md), and [impersonation protection in anti-spam policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)) are applied using the Standard template for [preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md).

By default, these policies are scoped to all users in the organization, but admins can customize the policies during or after setup so they apply only to specific users.

During setup, Defender for Office 365 response functionality (found in Defender for Office 365 P2 or equivalent) is also set up for the entire organization. No policy scoping is required.

## Licensing

As part of the trial setup, the Defender for Office 365 licenses are automatically applied to the organization. The licenses are free of charge for the first 90 days.

## Permissions

To start or end the trial, you need to be a member of the **Global Administrator** or **Security Administrator** roles in Azure Active Directory. For details, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Additional information

After you enroll in the trial, it might take up to 2 hours for the changes and updates to be available. And, admins must log out and log back in to see the changes.

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the <> card.

## Availability

The Defender for Office 365 trial is gradually rolling out to existing customers who meet specific criteria (including geography) and who don't have existing Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 licenses (included in their subscription or as an add-on).
