# Microsoft Defender for Office 365 overview

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is a seamless integration into Microsoft 365 subscriptions that protects against threats in email, links (URLS), file attachments, and collaboration tools. This article explains the _protection ladder_ in Microsoft 365 organizations. The protection ladder starts with Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and continues through to Defender for Office 365, which includes Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.

This article is intended for Security Operations (SecOps) personnel, admins in Microsoft 365, or decisions makers who want to learn more about Defender for Office 365.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using **Outlook.com**, **Microsoft 365 Family**, or **Microsoft 365 Personal**, and need information about _Safelinks_ or _advanced attachment scanning_, see [Advanced Outlook.com security for Microsoft 365 subscribers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/882d2243-eab9-4545-a58a-b36fee4a46e2).
>
> If you're new to your Microsoft 365 subscription and would like to know your licenses before you begin, go the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/subscriptions>.

All Microsoft 365 subscriptions include built-in security and protection features. The goals and available actions of these features vary. In Microsoft 365, there are three main security services (or products):

1. **Exchange Online Protection (EOP)**: Included in any subscription that includes Exchange Online mailboxes. Also available as a [standalone subscription](/exchange/standalone-eop/standalone-eop) to protect on-premises email environments.
2. **Defender for Office 365 365 Plan 1**: Included in some Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Exchange Online mailboxes that cater to small to medium-sized businesses (for example, Microsoft 365 Business Premium).
3. **Defender for Office 365 365 Plan 2**: Included in some Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Exchange Online mailboxes that cater to enterprise organizations (for example, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 A5, and Microsoft 365 GCC G5).

Defender for Office 365 always includes EOP. Defender for Office 365 is also available as an add-in subscription to many Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Exchange Online mailboxes.

Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 contains a subset of the features that are available in Plan 2. Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 contains many features that aren't available in Plan 1.

> [!TIP]
> For information about subscriptions that contain Defender for Office 365, see the [Microsoft 365 business plan comparison](https://aka.ms/M365BusinessPlans) and the [Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan comparison](https://aka.ms/M365EnterprisePlans).

EOP and Defender for Office 365 can be summarized with the following descriptions:

- **EOP** prevents broad, volume-based, known email attacks.
- **Defender for Office 365 Plan 1** protects email and collaboration features from zero-day malware, phishing, and business email compromise (BEC).
- **Defender for Office 365 Plan 2** adds phishing simulations, post-breach investigation, hunting, and response, and automation.

However, you can also think about the _architecture_ of EOP and Defender for Office 365 as _cumulative layers of security_, where each layer has a different _security emphasis_. This architecture is shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/eop-mdop1-mdop2-comparison.png" alt-text="Diagram about EOP and Defender for Office 365 and their relationships to one another with service emphasis, including a note for email authentication." lightbox="../../media/eop-mdop1-mdop2-comparison.png":::

EOP and Defender for Office 365 are capable of protecting, detecting, investigating, and responding to threats. But as you move up the protection ladder, the _available features_ and _automation_ increase.

Whether you're using the onmicrosoft.com domain only or custom domains for email in Microsoft 365, it's important to configure email authentication for your used and unused domains. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records in DNS allow Microsoft 365 to more accurately protect against spoofing attacks. For more information, see [Email authentication in Microsoft 365](email-authentication-about.md).

## The Microsoft 365 security ladder from EOP to Defender for Office 365

It can be difficult to identity the advantages of Defender for Office 365 over EOP. The following subsections describe the capabilities of each product using the following security emphases:

- Preventing and detecting threats.
- Investigating threats.
- Responding to threats.

### EOP capabilities

The capabilities of **EOP** are summarized in the following table:

|Prevent/Detect|Investigate|Respond|
|---|---|---|
|<ul><li>[Anti-malware protection](anti-malware-protection-about.md)<sup>\*</sup></li><li>[Anti-spam protection](anti-spam-protection-about.md)<sup>\*</sup>, including [bulk email protection](anti-spam-spam-vs-bulk-about.md)</li><li>[Anti-phishing (spoofing) protection](anti-phishing-protection-spoofing-about.md)<sup>\*</sup>, including the [Spoof intelligence insight](anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md)</li><li>[Outbound spam filtering](outbound-spam-protection-about.md)</li><li>[Connection filtering](connection-filter-policies-configure.md)</li><li>[Quarantine](quarantine-about.md) and [quarantine policies](quarantine-policies.md)</li><li>False positives and false negative reporting by [admin submissions to Microsoft](submissions-admin.md) and [user reported messages](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md)</li><li>[Allow and block entries in the Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md) for: <ul><li>Domains and email addresses</li><li>Spoof</li><li>URLs</li><li>Files</li></ul></li></ul>|<ul><li>[Audit log search](audit-log-search-defender-portal.md)</li><li>[Message Trace](message-trace-defender-portal.md)</li><li>[Email security reports](reports-email-security.md)</li></ul>|<ul><li>[Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) for email](zero-hour-auto-purge.md#zero-hour-auto-purge-zap-for-email-messages)</li><li>Refine and test entries in the [Tenant Allow/Block List](tenant-allow-block-list-about.md)</li></ul>|

<sup>\*</sup> The associated protection polices are available in default policies, custom policies, and [the Standard and Strict preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md). For help with deciding which method to use, see [Determine your protection policy strategy](mdo-deployment-guide.md#determine-your-protection-policy-strategy).

### Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 capabilities

Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 expands on the _prevention_ and _detection_ capabilities of EOP.

The additional features that you get in **Defender for Office 365 Plan 1** on top of EOP are described in the following table:

|Prevent/Detect|Investigate|Respond|
|---|---|---|
|<ul><li>The following [additional features in anti-phishing policies](anti-phishing-protection-about.md#additional-anti-phishing-protection-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365): <ul><li>User and domain impersonation protection</li><li>Mailbox intelligence impersonation protection (contact graph)</li><li>Advanced phishing thresholds</li></ul></li><li>[Safe Attachments in email](safe-attachments-about.md)</li><li>[Safe Attachments for files in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md)</li><li>[Safe Links in email, Office clients, and Teams](safe-links-about.md)</li><li>Email & collaboration alerts at <https://security.microsoft.com/viewalertsv2><li>SIEM integration API for **alerts**</li></ul>|<ul><li>[Real-time detections](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md)<sup>\*</sup></li><li>[The Email entity page](mdo-email-entity-page.md)</li><li>SIEM integration API for **detections**</li><li>[URL trace](../defender-endpoint/investigate-domain.md)</li><li>[Defender for Office 365 reports](reports-defender-for-office-365.md)</li></ul>|<ul><li>Same</li></ul>|

<sup>\*</sup> The presence of **Email & collaboration** \> **Real-time detections** in the Microsoft Defender portal is a quick way to differentiate between Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2.
