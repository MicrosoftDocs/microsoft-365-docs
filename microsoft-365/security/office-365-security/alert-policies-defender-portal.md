# Alert policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, alert policies generate alerts in the alert dashboard when users take actions that match the conditions of the policy. There are many default alert policies that help you monitor activities. For example, assigning admin privileges in Exchange Online, malware attacks, phishing campaigns, and unusual levels of file deletions and external sharing.

> [!TIP]
> Alert policies in the Microsoft Defender portal are identical to alert policies in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal at <https://compliance.microsoft.com/alertpolicies>.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:
  - [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role based access control (RBAC)](/microsoft-365/security/defender/manage-rbac) (Affects the Defender portal only, not PowerShell): **Security operations\Security data\Alerts (manage)** and **Security operations\Security data\ Security data basics (read)**.
  - [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](mdo-portal-permissions.md):
    - _Create and manage alert policies in the Threat management category_: Membership in the **Organization Management** or **Security Administrator** role groups.
    - _View alerts in the Threat management_ category: Membership in the **Security Reader** role group.
  - [Microsoft Entra permissions](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles): Membership in the **Global Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, or **Security Reader** roles gives users the required permissions _and_ permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

  For information about other alert policy categories, see [Permissions required to view alerts](/purview/alert-policies#rbac-permissions-required-to-view-alerts).

## Open alert policies

In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Alert policy**. Or, to go directly to the **Alert policy** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/alertpoliciesv2>.

On the **Alert policy** page, you can view and create alert policies. For more information, see [Alert policies in Microsoft 365](/purview/alert-policies)
