   The feature can also be enabled by running the following PowerShell command as administrator:

   ```powershell
   Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -online -FeatureName Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard
   ```

3. Look for the Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode group policy located at **Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Microsoft Defender Application Guard**. Turn this policy on by setting the value under Options as **2** or **3** then selecting **OK** or **Apply**.

   ![Turn on AG in Managed Mode](../../media/ag04-deploy.png)

   Alternatively, you can set the corresponding CSP policy:

   > OMA-URI: **./Device/Vendor/MSFT/WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard/Settings/AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard** <br> Data type: **Integer** <br> Value: **2**

4. Reboot the system.

### Set Diagnostics & feedback to send full data

This step ensures that the data necessary to identify and fix problems is
reaching Microsoft. Follow these steps to enable diagnostics on your Windows
device:

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

   ![Start menu](../../media/ag05-diagnostic.png)

2. On **Windows Settings**, select **Privacy**.

   ![Windows Settings menu](../../media/ag06-diagnostic.png)

3. Under Privacy, select **Diagnostics & feedback** and select **Optional diagnostic data**.

   ![Diagnostics and feedback menu](../../media/ag07a-diagnostic.png)

For more on configuring Windows diagnostic settings, refer to [Configuring Windows diagnostic data in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#enterprise-management).

### Confirm that Application Guard for Office is enabled and working

Before confirming that the Application Guard for Office is enabled, launch Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on a device where the policies have been deployed. Make sure Office is activated. You may need to use your work identity to activate the Office product first.

To confirm that Application Guard for Office is now enabled, launch Word, Excel, or PowerPoint and open an untrusted document. For example, you can open a document downloaded from the internet or an email attachment from someone outside your organization.

On the first launch of an untrusted file, you may see an Office splash screen like the one below. It might show for some time while Application Guard for Office is being activated and the file is being opened. Subsequent launches of untrusted files should be faster.

![Office app splash screen](../../media/ag08-confirm.png)

Upon being opened, the file should display a few visual indicators that the file was opened inside Application Guard for Office:

* A callout in the ribbon

  ![Doc file showing small App Guard note](../../media/ag09-confirm.png)

* The application icon with a shield in the taskbar

## Configure Application Guard for Office

Office supports the following policies to enable you to configure the capabilities of Application Guard for Office. These policies can be configured through Group policies or through the Office cloud policy service.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring these policies can disable some functionalities for files opened in Application Guard for Office.

|Policy|Description|
|---|---|
|Don't use Application Guard for Office|Enabling this policy will force Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to use the Protected View isolation container instead of Application Guard for Office. This policy can be used to temporarily disable Application Guard for Office when there are issues in leaving it enabled for Edge.|
|Configure Application Guard for Office container pre-creation|This policy determines if the Application Guard for Office container, for isolating untrusted files, is pre-created for improved run-time performance. If you enable this setting, you can specify the number of days to continue pre-creating an Application Guard for Office container or let Office built-in heuristic pre-create the container.
|Don't allow copy/paste for Office documents opened in Application Guard for Office|Enabling this policy will prevent a user from copying and pasting content from a document opened in Application Guard for Office to a document opened outside it.|
|Disable hardware accelaration in Application Guard for Office|This policy controls whether Application Guard for Office uses hardware accelaration to render graphics. If you enable this setting, Application Guard for Office uses software based (CPU) rendering and won't load any third-party graphics drivers or interact with any connected graphics hardware.
|Disable unsupported file types protection in Application Guard for Office|This policy controls whether Application Guard for Office will block unsupported file types from being oopened or if it will enable the redirection to Protected View.
|Turn off camera and microphone access for documents opened in Application Guard for Office|Enabling this policy will remove Office access to Camera and Microphone inside Application Guard for Office.|
|Restrict printing from documents opened in Application Guard for Office|Enabling this policy will limit printers a user can print to from a file opened in Application Guard for Office. For example, you can use this policy to restrict users to only print to PDF.|
|Prevent users from removing Application Guard for Office protection on files|Enabling this policy will remove the option (within the Office application experience) to disable Application Guard for Office protection or open a file outside Application Guard for Office. <p> **Note:** Users can still bypass this policy by manually removing the mark-of-the-web property from the file or by moving a document to a Trusted location.|
|

> [!NOTE]
> The following policies will require the user to log off and re-login to Windows to take effect:
>
> * Disable copy/paste for documents opened in Application Guard for Office
> * Restrict printing for documents opened in Application Guard for Office
> * Turn off camera and mic access to documents opened in Application Guard for Office

## Integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Application Guard for Office is integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide monitoring and alerting on malicious activity
happening in the isolated environment.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. For more details about this platform, visit the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp) page. Learn more about onboarding devices to this platform at [Onboard devices to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/onboard-configure).

You can also configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to work with Defender for Endpoint. Refer to [Integrate Defender for Office 365 with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integrate-office-365-ti-with-wdatp.md).

## Limitations and considerations

* Application Guard for Office is a restricted mode that isolates untrusted documents from accessing trusted corporate resources, intranet, the user's identity, and arbitrary files present on the computer. As a result, if a user tries to access a feature that has a dependency on such access, for example, inserting a picture from a local file on disk, it will fail and produce a prompt like the one below. To enable an untrusted document to access trusted resources, users must remove Application Guard protection from the document.

  ![Dialog box saying To help you keep safe, this feature is not available](../../media/ag10-limitations.png)

  > [!NOTE]
  > Advise users to only remove protection if they trust the file and its source or where it came from.

* Active content in documents like macros and ActiveX controls are disabled in Application Guard for Office. Users need to remove Application Guard protection to enable active content.

* Untrusted files opened from network shares or files shared from OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online from a different organization open as read-only in Application Guard. Users can save a local copy of such files to continue working in the container or remove protection to directly work with the original file.

* Files that are protected by Information Rights Management (IRM) are blocked by default. Your administrator will need to configure unsupported file types policy setting for your organization if you wish to open such files in Protected View.

* Any customizations to Office applications in Application Guard for Office will not persist after a user logs off and logs back in or reboots the device.

* Only Accessibility tools that use the UIA framework can provide an accessible experience for files opened in Application Guard for Office.

* Network connectivity is required for the first launch of Application Guard after installation. This is required for Application Guard to validate the license.

* In the document's info section, the *Last Modified By* property may display WDAGUtilityAccount as the user. This is the anonymous user configured in Application Guard given that the desktop user's identity is not shared inside the Application Guard container.

## Performance optimizations for Application Guard for Office

This section provides an overview of the performance optimizations used in Application Guard for Office. This information can help administrators diagnose reports from users related to the performance of Office or the overall system when Application Guard is enabled.

Application Guard uses a virtualized container to isolate untrusted documents away from the system. The process of creating a container and setting up the Application Guard container to open Office documents has a performance overhead that might negatively impact user experience when users open an  untrusted document.

To provide users with the expected file opening experience, Application Guard uses logic to pre-create a container when the following heuristic is met on a system: A user has opened a file in either Protected View or Application Guard in the past 28 days.

When this heuristic is met, Office will pre-create an Application Guard container for the user after they log in to Windows. When this pre-create operation is in progress, the system may experience slow performance. This will resolve as soon as the operation completes.

> [!NOTE]
> The hints needed for the heuristic used to pre-create the container are generated by Office applications as a user uses them. If a user installs Office on a new system where Application Guard is enabled, Office will not pre-create the container until after the first time a user opens an untrusted document on the system. The user will observe that this first file takes longer to open in Application Guard.

## Known issues

* Clicking on web links (`http` or `https`) does not open the browser.
* Pasting rich text format (RTF) content or images in Office documents opened with Application Guard is not supported at this time. 
* .NET updates cause files to fail to open in Application Guard. As a workaround, users can reboot their device when this issue is encountered.
