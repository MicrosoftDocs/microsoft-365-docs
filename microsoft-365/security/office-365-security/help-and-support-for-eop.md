# Help and support for EOP

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, the technical support resources listed in this article can help you find answers if you have difficulty with EOP. Microsoft provides self-support and assisted-support for EOP.

## Self-support options

After you sign in, the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com> provides information about the status of your organization's services. Also, the service health section shows the current status of your services, details about disruptions and outages, and lists planned maintenance times. The Microsoft 365 admin center also provides information about known issues and expected resolutions. If you're affected by a service-wide event, then you should see a communication alert (typically accompanied by a bell icon). We recommend that you read and act on any items as appropriate. For more information about the service health area, see [Service health and continuity](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/service-health-and-continuity). You might be able to find more help on your own by using the tools, forums, and community sites listed here.

## Assisted support from Microsoft

You can get help from Microsoft by starting a new service request within the Microsoft 365 admin center or by calling on the phone. Premier Support subscribers have other support options.

These options are described in the following subsections

### Support for Microsoft Premier Support Subscribers

EOP customers with Microsoft Premier Support contracts can get support through the normal Microsoft Premier Support channels (for example, a Premier Technical Account Manager (TAM) and case submission). Premier Support for Microsoft Online Services provides you with a unified support experience across all products and services. This service helps ensure that customers can resolve issues quickly, and simplifies the task of managing support for different components of an IT infrastructure.

For more information about how Premier Support can help your organization maximize value from your IT investments, see [Premier Support for Partners](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/microsoft-services-premier-support).

### Ask for help on the web

Open the Microsoft 365 admin center at <https://admin.microsoft.com>, and then go to **...Show all** (if necessary) \> **Support** \> **Help & support**.

In the **How can we help?** flyout that opens, adds information about your issue, search for solutions to previous issues, or attach logs or related files.

## Support telephone numbers

Microsoft provides local or toll-free telephone numbers for product support around the world. Many of these support centers provide help in your local language during business hours or in English 24 hours a day, every day.
