The Microsoft Defender Core service is releasing with [Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform version 4.18.23110.2009](./msda-updates-previous-versions-technical-upgrade-support.md#october-2023-platform-418231002009--engine-11231002009).

  - Mid April 2024 to Enterprise customers running Windows clients.
    
  - Mid May 2024 to Enterprise customers running Windows Servers.
    
  - Mid June 2024 to U.S. Government customers running Windows clients and Windows Servers.
    
- Enterprise customers should allow the following URLs:

  - `*.events.data.microsoft.com`
    
  - `*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com`
