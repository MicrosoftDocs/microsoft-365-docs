# Run the client analyzer on macOS and Linux

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

The XMDEClientAnalyzer is used for diagnosing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint health or reliability issues on onboarded devices running either Linux, or macOS.

There are two ways to run the client analyzer tool:

1. Using a binary version (no Python dependency)
2. Using a Python-based solution

## Running the binary version of the client analyzer

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer Binary](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate.\
If using a terminal download using the command:

    ```console
    wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary
    ```

2. Verify the download

    > [!NOTE]
    > The current SHA256 hash of 'XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip' that is downloaded from the above link is: 'A44575A26F39B07ED23B12B7DFC2727F5A1B9D45E74DDBBC5721B81AC0359D26'

    ```console
    echo 'A44575A26F39B07ED23B12B7DFC2727F5A1B9D45E74DDBBC5721B81AC0359D26  XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip' | sha256sum -c
    ```

3. Extract the contents of <i>XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip</i> on the machine.

    If using a terminal download using the command:

    ```console
    unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip -d XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary
    ```

4. Change to the tool's directory using the following command:

    ```console
    cd XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary
    ```

5. Three new zip files will be produced:
      1. **SupportToolLinuxBinary.zip** : For all Linux devices
      2. **SupportToolmacOSBinary.zip** : For Intel based Mac devices
      3. **SupportToolmacOS-armBinary.zip** : For Arm based Mac devices

6. Unzip one of the above 3 zip files based on the machine you need to investigate.\
When using a terminal, unzip the file using one of the following commands based on machine type:

   - Linux

   ```console
   unzip -q SupportToolLinuxBinary.zip
   ```

   - Intel based Mac

   ```console
   unzip -q SupportToolmacOSBinary.zip
   ```

   - For Arm based Mac devices

   ```console
   unzip -q SupportToolmacOS-armBinary.zip
   ```

7. Run the tool as <i>root</i> to generate diagnostic package:

   ```console
   sudo ./MDESupportTool -d
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The binary is currently unsigned. To allow the package run on MacOS, you will need to use the command
   >
   > `spctl --add /Path/To/MDESupportTool`
   >

## Running the Python-based client analyzer

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The analyzer depends on few extra pip packages(sh, distro, lxml, pandas) to produce the result output. If not installed, the analyzer will try to fetch it from the [official repository for Python packages](https://pypi.org/search/?q=lxml).
>
> - In addition, the tool currently requires Python version 3 or later to be installed.
>
> - If your device is behind a proxy, then you can simply pass the proxy server as an environment variable to the mde_support_tool.sh script. For example:
.
>   `https_proxy=https://myproxy.contoso.com:8080 ./mde_support_tool.sh"`

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate.

    If using a terminal, download by running the command:

    ```console
    wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

2. Verify the download

    ```console
    echo 'E01AABF2AC357F6FED0B8F435CBFA5BF93DC2B97A75807AF392D9BB4B6D9AF52  XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip' | sha256sum -c
    ```

3. Extract the contents of XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine.\
    If using a terminal unzip using the command:

    ```console
    unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip -d XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

4. Change directory to the extracted location.

    ```console
    cd XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

5. Give the tool executable permission:

    ```console
    chmod a+x mde_support_tool.sh
    ```

6. Run as a non-root user to install required dependencies:

    ```console
    ./mde_support_tool.sh
    ```

7. To collect actual diagnostic package and generate the result archive file run again as root:

    ```console
    sudo ./mde_support_tool.sh -d
    ```

## Command line options

### Primary command lines

Use this for getting machine diagnostic

```console
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                      Output path to export report
--no-zip, -nz         If set a directory will be created instead of an archive file
--force, -f           Will overwrite if output directory exists
--diagnostic, -d      Collect extensive machine diagnostic information
--bypass-disclaimer   Do not display disclaimer banner
--mdatp-log {info,trace,error,warning,debug,verbose}
                      Set MDATP log level
--max-log-size MAX_LOG_SIZE
                      Maximum log file size in MB before rotating(Will restart mdatp)
```

Usage example: `sudo ./MDESupportTool -d`

### Positional arguments

#### Collect performance info

Collect extensive machine performance tracing for analysis of a performance scenario that can be reproduced on demand

```console
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--frequency FREQUENCY
                      profile at this frequency
--length LENGTH       length of time to collect (in seconds)
```

Usage example: `sudo ./MDESupportTool performance --frequency 2`

#### Use OS trace (for macOS only)

Use OS tracing facilities to record Defender for Endpoint performance traces.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists in the Python solution only.

```console
-h, --help       show this help message and exit
--length LENGTH  Length of time to record the trace (in seconds).
--mask MASK      Mask to select with event to trace. Defaults to all
```

On running this command for the first time, it will install a Profile configuration.

Follow this to approve profile installation: [Apple Support Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh35561/mac#:~:text=Choose%20Apple%20menu%20%3E%20System%20Settings,%2C%20double%2Dclick%20the%20profile.)

Usage example `./mde_support_tool.sh trace --length 5`

#### Exclude mode

Add exclusions for audit-d monitoring.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists for Linux only

```console
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-e <executable>, --exe <executable>
                      exclude by executable name, i.e: bash
-p <process id>, --pid <process id>
                      exclude by process id, i.e: 911
-d <directory>, --dir <directory>
                      exclude by target path, i.e: /var/foo/bar
-x <executable> <directory>, --exe_dir \<executable\> <directory>
                      exclude by executable path and target path, i.e:
                      /bin/bash /var/foo/bar
-q <q_size>, --queue <q_size>
                      set dispatcher q_depth size
-r, --remove          remove exclusion file
-s, --stat            get statistics about common executables
-l, --list            list auditd rules
```

Usage example `sudo ./MDESupportTool exclude -d /var/foo/bar`

### AuditD Rate Limiter

Syntax that can be used to limit the number of events being reported by the auditD plugin. This option will set the rate limit globally for AuditD causing a drop in all the audit events. When the limiter is enabled the number of auditd events will be limited to 2500 events/sec. This option can be used in cases where we see high CPU usage from AuditD side.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists for Linux only.

```console
-h, --help                                  show this help message and exit
-e <true/false>, --enable <true/false>      enable/disable the rate limit with default values
```

Usage example `sudo ./mde_support_tool.sh ratelimit -e true`

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality should be carefully used as limits the number of events being reported by the auditd subsystem as a whole. This could reduces the number of events for other subscribers as well.
