# Run the client analyzer on macOS and Linux

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2146631)

## Running the analyzer through GUI scenario

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The current SHA256 hash of 'XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip' that is downloaded from the above link is: '029296D437BA97B5563D0C75DD874F8F51C563B2B5AC16745619F4DB2E064C85'.

2. Extract the contents of XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine.

3. Open a terminal session, change directory to the extracted location and run:

   `./mde_support_tool.sh -d`

   > [!NOTE]
   > On Linux, if the script does not have permissions to execute, then you'll need to first run:
   >
   > `chmod a+x mde_support_tool.sh`

## Running the analyzer using a terminal or SSH scenario

1. Open a terminal or SSH into the relevant machine.

2. Run `wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip* <https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer> *&& unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip && cd XMDEClientAnalyzer && chmod +x mde_support_tool.sh"`

3. Run `./mde_support_tool.sh -d` to generate the result archive file.

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux, the analyzer requires 'lxml' to produce the result output. If not installed, the analyzer will try to fetch it from the official repository for python packages below: <https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/\*/lxml\*.whl>
>
> In addition, the tool currently requires Python version 3 or later to be installed.
