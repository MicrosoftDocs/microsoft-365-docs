# Run the client analyzer on macOS and Linux


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

## Running the analyzer through GUI scenario

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The current SHA256 hash of 'XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip' that is downloaded from the above link is: '815F3E83EB1E6C33D712F101618018E1E38211D4E2807C3A9EF3CC0B0F95225C'

2. Extract the contents of XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine.

3. Open a terminal session, change directory to the extracted location and run:

   `./mde_support_tool.sh -d`

   > [!NOTE]
   > On Linux, if the script does not have permissions to execute, then you'll need to first run:
   >
   > `chmod a+x mde_support_tool.sh`

## Running the analyzer using a terminal or SSH scenario

Open a terminal or SSH into the relevant machine and run the following commands:

1. `wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer`

2. `unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip`

3. `cd XMDEClientAnalyzer`

4. `chmod +x mde_support_tool.sh`

3. Run as non-root use to install required pip and lxml which components: `./mde_support_tool.sh`

4. To collect actual diagnostic package and generate the result archive file run again as root: `./mde_support_tool.sh -d`

> [!NOTE]
> - For Linux, the analyzer requires 'lxml' to produce the result output. If not installed, the analyzer will try to fetch it from the official repository for python packages below: <https://pypi.org/search/?q=lxml>
> 
> - In addition, the tool currently requires Python version 3 or later to be installed.
>
> - If you are running on a machine that cannot use Python 3 or fetch the lxml component, then you can download a binary based version of the analyzer that does not have any of the requirements: [XMDE Client Analyzer Binary](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary). <br> Note that the binary is currently unsigned. To allow the package run on MacOS, you will need to use the syntax: "spctl --add /Path/To/Application.app".
> - The current SHA256 hash of 'XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip' that is downloaded from the above link is: '01B6165F54C00083F40D8BC9481911897591B9497D04395F3440382DFD03B481'
>
> - If your device is behind a proxy, then you can simply pass the proxy server as an environment variable to the mde_support_tool.sh script. For example:
> `https_proxy=https://myproxy.contoso.com:8080 ./mde_support_tool.sh"`

Additional syntax help:

**-h** \# Help<br>
\# Show help message

**performance** \# Performance<br>
\# Collects extensive tracing for analysis of a performance issue that can be reproduced on demand. Using `--length=<seconds>` to specify the duration of the benchmark.

**-o** \# Output<br>
\# Specify the destination path for the result file

**-nz** \# No-Zip<br>
\# If set, a directory will be created instead of a resulting archive file

**-f** \# Force<br>
\# Overwrite if output already exists in destination path
