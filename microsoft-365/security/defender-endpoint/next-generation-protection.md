# Next-generation protection overview

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes next-generation protection to reinforce the security perimeter of your network. Next-generation protection was designed to catch all types of emerging threats. In addition to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, your next-generation protection services include the following capabilities:

- [Behavior-based, heuristic, and real-time antivirus protection](configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes always-on scanning using file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as *real-time protection*). It also includes detecting and blocking apps that are deemed unsafe, but might not be detected as malware.
- [Cloud-delivered protection](cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats.
- [Dedicated protection and product updates](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date.

## Try a demo!

Visit the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint demo website](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the following protection features are working and explore them using demo scenarios:

- Cloud-delivered protection
- Block at first sight (BAFS) protection
- Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) protection

## Configure next-generation protection services

For information on how to configure next-generation protection services, see [Configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus features](configure-microsoft-defender-antivirus-features.md).
