# Next-generation protection overview

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes next-generation protection to reinforce the security perimeter of your network. Next-generation protection was designed to catch all types of emerging threats. In addition to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, your next-generation protection services include the following capabilities:

- [Behavior-based, heuristic, and real-time antivirus protection](configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes always-on scanning using file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as *real-time protection*). It also includes detecting and blocking apps that are deemed unsafe, but might not be detected as malware.
- [Cloud-delivered protection](cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats.
- [Dedicated protection and product updates](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date.

> [!TIP]
> Next-generation protection is included in both Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (preview) and Plan 2. [Learn more about Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (preview) and Plan 2](defender-endpoint-plan-1-2.md)
