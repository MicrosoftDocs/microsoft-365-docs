# Controlled folder access (CFA) demonstration test tool (block script)

Controlled Folder Access helps you protect valuable data from malicious apps and threats, such as ransomware. All apps (any executable file, including .exe, .scr, .dll files and others) are assessed by Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which then determines if the app is malicious or safe. If the app is determined to be malicious or suspicious, then it will not be allowed to make changes to any files in any protected folder.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 10 1709 build 16273
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active mode)

## PowerShell commands

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess <State>
```

## Rule states

|State | Mode| Numeric value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Disabled | = Off | 0 |
| Enabled | = Block mode | 1 |
| Audit | = Audit mode | 2 |

### Verify configuration

```powershell
Get-MpPreference
```

## Scenario

### Setup

Download and run this [setup script](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com/Content/CFA_SetupScript.zip). Before running the script set execution policy to Unrestricted using this PowerShell command:

You can perform these manual steps instead:

1. Turn on CFA using PowerShell command:

  ```powershell
  Set-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Enabled
  ```
