Web threat protection is part of [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) in Defender for Endpoint. It uses [network protection](network-protection.md) to secure your devices against web threats. By integrating with Microsoft Edge and popular third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox, web threat protection stops web threats without a web proxy and can protect devices while they are away or on premises. Web threat protection stops access to phishing sites, malware vectors, exploit sites, untrusted or low-reputation sites, as well as sites that you have blocked in your [custom indicator list](manage-indicators.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to an hour for devices to receive new custom indicators.

## Prerequisites

Web protection uses network protection to provide web browsing security on Microsoft Edge and third-party web browsers.

To turn on network protection on your devices:

- Edit the Defender for Endpoint security baseline under **Web & Network Protection** to enable network protection before deploying or redeploying it. [Learn about reviewing and assigning the Defender for Endpoint security baseline](configure-machines-security-baseline.md#review-and-assign-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-security-baseline)
- Turn network protection on using Intune device configuration, SCCM, Group Policy, or your MDM solution. [Read more about enabling network protection](enable-network-protection.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you set network protection to **Audit only**, blocking will be unavailable. Also, you will be able to detect and log attempts to access malicious and unwanted websites on Microsoft Edge only.

## Configure web threat protection

The following procedure describes how to configure web threat protection using the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

1. Go to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)), and sign in.
 
2. Choose **Endpoint security** \> **Attack surface reduction**, and then choose **+ Create policy**.

3. Select a platform, such as **Windows 10 and later**, select the **Web protection** profile, and then choose **Create**. 

4. On the **Basics** tab, specify a name and description, and then choose **Next**.

5. On the **Configuration settings** tab, expand **Web Protection**, specify your settings, and then choose **Next**.

   - Set **Enable network protection** to **Enabled** so web protection is turned on. Alternately, you can set network protection to **Audit mode** to see how it will work in your environment. In audit mode, network protection does not prevent users from visiting sites or domains, but it does track detections as events. 
   - To protect users from potential phishing scams and malicious software, turn **Require SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge Legacy** to **Yes**.
   - To prevent users from bypassing warnings about potentially malicious sites, set **Block malicious site access** to **Yes**.
   - To prevent users from bypassing the warnings and downloading unverified files, set **Block unverified file download** tl **Yes**. 

6. On the **Scope tags** tab, if your organization is using scope tags, choose **+ Select scope tags**, and then choose **Next**. (If you are not using scope tags, choose **Next**.) To learn more about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags).

7. On the **Assignments** tab, specify the users and devices to receive the web protection policy, and then choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review + create** tab, review your policy settings, and then choose **Create**.
