# Protect devices from exploits

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Exploit protection automatically applies many exploit mitigation techniques to operating system processes and apps. Exploit protection is supported beginning with Windows 10, version 1709, Windows 11, and Windows Server, version 1803.

> [!TIP]
> You can visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

> [!NOTE]
> The Defender for Endpoint demo site at demo.wd.microsoft.com is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

Exploit protection works best with [Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into exploit protection events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](investigate-alerts.md).

You can [enable exploit protection](enable-exploit-protection.md) on an individual device, and then use [Group Policy](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md) to distribute the XML file to multiple devices at once.

When a mitigation is found on the device, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-implement.md#customize-attack-surface-reduction-rules) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

You can also use [audit mode](evaluate-exploit-protection.md) to evaluate how exploit protection would affect your organization if it were enabled.

Many of the features in the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751) are included in exploit protection. In fact, you can convert and import existing your EMET configuration profiles into exploit protection. To learn more, see [Import, export, and deploy exploit protection configurations](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are currently using EMET you should be aware that [EMET reached end of support on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). Consider replacing EMET with exploit protection in Windows 10.

> [!WARNING]
> Some security mitigation technologies may have compatibility issues with some applications. You should test exploit protection in all target use scenarios by using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md) before deploying the configuration across a production environment or the rest of your network.

## Review exploit protection events in the Microsoft Security Center

Defender for Endpoint provides detailed reporting into events and blocks as part of its alert investigation scenarios.

You can query Defender for Endpoint data by using [Advanced hunting](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/advanced-hunting-overview). If you're using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md), you can use advanced hunting to see how exploit protection settings could affect your environment.

Here's an example query:

```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType startswith 'ExploitGuard' and ActionType !contains 'NetworkProtection'
```

## Review exploit protection events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when exploit protection blocks (or audits) an app:<br/><br/>

|Provider/source | Event ID | Description|

|Security-Mitigations | 1 | ACG audit |
|Security-Mitigations | 2 | ACG enforce |

|Security-Mitigations | 24 | ROP SimExec enforce |
|WER-Diagnostics | 5 | CFG Block |
|Win32K | 260 | Untrusted Font |

## Mitigation comparison

The mitigations available in EMET are included natively in Windows 10 (starting with version 1709), Windows 11, and Windows Server (starting with version 1803), under [Exploit protection](exploit-protection.md).

The table in this section indicates the availability and support of native mitigations between EMET and exploit protection.<br/><br/>

|Mitigation | Available under exploit protection | Available in EMET |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Arbitrary code guard (ACG) | Yes | Yes<br />As "Memory Protection Check" |
|Block remote images | Yes | Yes<br/>As "Load Library Check" |
|Block untrusted fonts | Yes | Yes |
|Data Execution Prevention (DEP) | Yes | Yes |
|Export address filtering (EAF) | Yes | Yes |
|Force randomization for images (Mandatory ASLR) | Yes | Yes |
|NullPage Security Mitigation | Yes<br />Included natively in Windows 10 and Windows 11 <br/>See  [Mitigate threats by using Windows 10 security features](/windows/security/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10#understanding-windows-10-in-relation-to-the-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit) for more information | Yes |

> [!NOTE]

> The Advanced ROP mitigations that are available in EMET are superseded by ACG in Windows 10 and Windows 11, which other EMET advanced settings are enabled by default, as part of enabling the anti-ROP mitigations for a process. See the [Mitigation threats by using Windows 10 security features](/windows/security/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10#understanding-windows-10-in-relation-to-the-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit) for more information on how Windows 10 employs existing EMET technology.
