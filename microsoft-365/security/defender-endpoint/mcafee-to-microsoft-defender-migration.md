# Migrate from McAfee to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

If you are planning to switch from McAfee Endpoint Security (McAfee) to [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection) (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint), you're in the right place. Use this article as a guide.


:::image type="content" source="images/mcafee-mde-migration.png" alt-text="Overview of migrating from McAfee to Defender for Endpoint":::

When you make the switch from McAfee to Defender for Endpoint, you begin with your McAfee solution in active mode, configure Defender for Endpoint in passive mode, onboard to Defender for Endpoint, and then set Defender for Endpoint to active mode and remove McAfee.

## The migration process

When you switch from McAfee to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you follow a process that can be divided into three phases: Prepare, Setup, and Onboard.

|Phase |Description |
|--|--|
|[Prepare for your migration](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-prepare.md) |During the [**Prepare**](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-prepare.md) phase, you update your organization's devices, get Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, plan your roles and permissions, and grant access to the Microsoft Defender Security Center. You also configure your device proxy and internet settings to enable communication between your organization's devices and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. |
|[Set up Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-setup.md) |During the [**Setup**](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-setup.md) phase, you enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus and make sure it's in passive mode, and you configure settings & exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and McAfee. You also create device groups, collections, and organizational units. Finally, you configure your antimalware policies and real-time protection settings.|
|[Onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-onboard.md) |During the [**Onboard**](mcafee-to-microsoft-defender-onboard.md) phase, you onboard your devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and verify that those devices are communicating with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Last, you uninstall McAfee and make sure that protection through Microsoft Defender Antivirus & Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is in active mode. |
