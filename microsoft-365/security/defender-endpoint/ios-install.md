## Complete deployment for supervised devices

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS app has specialized ability on supervised iOS/iPadOS devices, given the increased management capabilities provided by the platform on these types of devices. It can also provide Web Protection **without setting up a local VPN on the device**. This gives end-users a seamless experience while still being protected from phishing and other web-based attacks.

Admins can use the following steps to configure supervised devices.

### Configure Supervised Mode via Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune)

Configure the supervised mode for Defender for Endpoint app through an App configuration policy and Device configuration profile.

#### App configuration policy

> [!NOTE]
> This app configuration policy for supervised devices is applicable only to managed devices and should be targeted for ALL managed iOS devices as a best practice.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Apps** \> **App configuration policies** \> **Add**. Select **Managed devices**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-4.png" alt-text="Image of Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center4." lightbox="images/ios-deploy-4.png":::

1. In the *Create app configuration policy* page, provide the following information:
    - Policy Name
    - Platform: Select iOS/iPadOS
    - Targeted app: Select **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** from the list

    :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-5.png" alt-text="Image of Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center5." lightbox="images/ios-deploy-5.png":::

1. In the next screen, select **Use configuration designer** as the format. Specify the following properties:
    - Configuration Key: `issupervised`
    - Value type: String
    - Configuration Value: `{{issupervised}}`

    :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-6.png" alt-text="Image of Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center6." lightbox="images/ios-deploy-6.png":::

1. Select **Next** to open the **Scope tags** page. Scope tags are optional. Select **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Assignments** page, select the groups that will receive this profile. For this scenario, it is best practice to target **All Devices**. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-assign).

   When deploying to user groups, a user must sign in to a device before the policy applies.

   Click **Next**.

1. On the **Review + create** page, when you're done, choose **Create**. The new profile is displayed in the list of configuration profiles.

#### Device configuration profile (Control Filter)

> [!NOTE]
> For devices that run iOS/iPadOS (in Supervised Mode), there is  custom **.mobileconfig** profile, called the **ControlFilter** profile available. This profile enables Web Protection **without setting up the local loopback VPN on the device**. This gives end-users a seamless experience while still being protected from phishing and other web-based attacks.

Admins deploy any one of the given profiles.

1. **Zero touch (Silent) Control Filter** - This profile enables silent onboarding for users. Download the config profile from [ControlFilterZeroTouch](https://aka.ms/mdeiosprofilesupervisedzerotouch)

2. **Control Filter** - Download the config profile from [ControlFilter](https://aka.ms/mdeiosprofilesupervised).

Once the profile has been downloaded, deploy the custom profile. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create Profile**.
1. Select **Profile Type** > **Templates** and **Template name** > **Custom**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-7.png" alt-text="Image of Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center7." lightbox="images/ios-deploy-7.png":::

1. Provide a name of the profile. When prompted to import a Configuration profile file, select the one downloaded from the previous step.
1. In the **Assignment** section, select the device group to which you want to apply this profile. As a best practice, this should be applied to all managed iOS devices. Select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Device Group creation is supported in both Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.

1. On the **Review + create** page, when you're done, choose **Create**. The new profile is displayed in the list of configuration profiles.

## Automated Onboarding setup (only for Unsupervised devices)

Admins can automate the Defender onboarding for users in two different ways with Zero touch(Silent) Onboarding or Auto Onboarding of VPN.

### Zero-touch (Silent) onboarding of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

> [!NOTE]
> Zero-touch cannot be configured on iOS devices that are enrolled without user affinity (user-less devices or shared devices).

Admins can configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to deploy and activate silently. In this flow, the administrator creates a deployment profile and the user is simply notified of the installation. Defender for Endpoint is automatically installed without the need for the user to open the app. Follow the steps below to set up zero-touch or silent deployment of Defender for Endpoint on enrolled iOS devices:

1. In [Microsoft Endpoint manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create Profile**.
1. Choose **Platform** as **iOS/iPadOS** and **Profile type** as **VPN**. Select **Create**.
1. Type a name for the profile and select **Next**.
1. Select **Custom VPN** for Connection Type and in the **Base VPN** section, enter the following:
   - Connection Name = Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
   - VPN server address = 127.0.0.1
   - Auth method = "Username and password"
   - Split Tunneling = Disable
   - VPN identifier = com.microsoft.scmx
   - In the key-value pairs, enter the key **SilentOnboard** and set the value to **True**.
   - Type of Automatic VPN = On-demand VPN
   - Select **Add** for **On Demand Rules** and select **I want to do the following = Connect VPN**, **I want to restrict to = All domains**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-9.png" alt-text="The VPN profile Configuration page" lightbox="images/ios-deploy-9.png":::

   - To mandate that VPN can't be disabled in users device, Admins can select **Yes** from **Block users from disabling automatic VPN**. By default, it's not configured and users can disable VPN only in the Settings.
   - To allow Users to Change the VPN toggle from within the app, add **EnableVPNToggleInApp = TRUE**, in the key-value pairs. By default, users can't change the toggle from within the app.

1. Select **Next** and assign the profile to targeted users.
1. In the *Review + Create* section, verify that all the information entered is correct and then select **Create**.

Once the above configuration is done and synced with the device, the following actions take place on the targeted iOS device(s):

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will be deployed and silently onboarded and the device will be seen in the Defender for Endpoint portal.
- A provisional notification will be sent to the user device.
- Web Protection and other features will be activated.

> [!NOTE]
> For supervised devices, admins can setup Zero touch onboarding with the new [ZeroTouch Control Filter Profile](#device-configuration-profile-control-filter).
Defender for Endpoint VPN Profile will not be installed on the device and Web protection will be provided by the Control Filter Profile.

### Auto-Onboarding of VPN profile (Simplified Onboarding)

> [!NOTE]
> This step simplifies the onboarding process by setting up the VPN profile. If you are using Zero touch, you do not need to perform this step. 

For unsupervised devices, a VPN is used to provide the Web Protection feature. This is not a regular VPN and is a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.

Admins can configure auto-setup of VPN profile. This will automatically set up the Defender for Endpoint VPN profile without having the user to do so while onboarding.

1. In [Microsoft Endpoint manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create Profile**.
1. Choose **Platform** as **iOS/iPadOS** and **Profile type** as **VPN**. Click **Create**.
1. Type a name for the profile and click **Next**.
1. Select **Custom VPN** for Connection Type and in the **Base VPN** section, enter the following:
   - Connection Name = Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
   - VPN server address = 127.0.0.1
   - Auth method = "Username and password"
   - Split Tunneling = Disable
   - VPN identifier = com.microsoft.scmx
   - In the key-value pairs, enter the key **AutoOnboard** and set the value to **True**.
   - Type of Automatic VPN = On-demand VPN
   - Select **Add** for **On Demand Rules** and select **I want to do the following = Connect VPN**, **I want to restrict to = All domains**.

      :::image type="content" source="images/ios-deploy-8.png" alt-text="The VPN profile Configuration settings tab." lightbox="images/ios-deploy-8.png":::

   - To require that VPN cannot be disabled on a users' device, Admins can select **Yes** from **Block users from disabling automatic VPN**. By default, this setting not configured and users can disable VPN only in the Settings.
   - To allow Users to Change the VPN toggle from within the app, add **EnableVPNToggleInApp = TRUE**, in the key-value pairs. By default, users cannot change the toggle from within the app.

1. Click **Next** and assign the profile to targeted users.
1. In the *Review + Create* section, verify that all the information entered is correct and then select **Create**.

## Complete onboarding and check status

1. Once Defender for Endpoint on iOS has been installed on the device, you will see the app icon.

   :::image type="icon" source="images/41627a709700c324849bf7e13510c516.png":::
