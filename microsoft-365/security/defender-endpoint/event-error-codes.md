# Review events and errors using Event Viewer

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Event Viewer
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-enablesiem-abovefoldlink)

You can review event IDs in the [Event Viewer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa745633(v=bts.10).aspx) on individual devices.

For example, if devices aren't appearing in the **Devices list**, you might need to look for event IDs on the devices. You can then use this table to determine further troubleshooting steps.

**Open Event Viewer and find the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service event log:**

1. Click **Start** on the Windows menu, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2. In the log list, under **Log Summary**, scroll until you see **Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational**. Double-click the item to
   open the log.

   You can also access the log by expanding **Applications and Services Logs** \> **Microsoft** \> **Windows** \> **SENSE** and click on **Operational**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

3. Events recorded by the service will appear in the log. See the following table for a list of events recorded by the service.
