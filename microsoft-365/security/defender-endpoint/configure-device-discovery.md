# Configure device discovery

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2146631)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)


[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

Discovery can be configured to be on standard or basic mode. Use the standard option to actively find devices in your network, which will better guarantee the discovery of endpoints and provide richer device classification. 

You can customize the list of devices that are used to perform standard discovery. You can either enable standard discovery on all the onboarded devices that also support this capability (currently - Windows 10 devices only) or select a subset or subsets of your devices by specifying their device tags. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> For preview, you'll first need to turn on the Preview features in Microsoft Defender Security Center.
> You can then access the device discovery configuration in Microsoft 365 security center. The list of unmanaged devices and security recommendations will be available in both Microsoft Defender Security Center and Microsoft 365 security center, while the dashboard tiles will only be available in Microsoft 365 security center.


Take the following configuration steps in Microsoft 365 security center:

1.	Navigate to **Settings > Device discovery**.
2.	Select the discovery mode to use on your onboarded devices. 
3.	If you've selected to use standard discovery, select which devices to use for active probing: all devices or on a subset by specifying their device tags.
4. Click **Save**.


## Exclude devices from being actively probed in standard discovery
If there are devices on your network which should not be actively scanned (for example, devices used as honeypots for another security tool), you can also define a list of exclusions to prevent them from being scanned. Note that devices can still be discovered using Basic discovery mode. Those devices will be passively discovered but won't be actively probed. 

## Select networks to monitor
 Microsoft Defender for Endpoint analyzes a network and determines if it is a corporate network that needs to be monitored or a non-corporate network that can be ignored. Corporate networks are typically chosen to be monitored. However, you can override this decision by choosing to monitor non-corporate networks where onboarded devices are found. 

You can configure where device discovery can be performed by specifying which networks to monitor. When a network is monitored, device discovery can be performed on it. 

A list of networks where device discovery can be performed is shown in the **Monitored networks** page. 


>[!NOTE]
> Only top 50 networks (according to the number of associated devices) will be available in the network list. 


The list of monitored networks is sorted based upon the total number of devices seen on the network in the last 7 days.


You can apply a filter to view any of the following network discovery states:

- **Monitored networks** - Networks where device discovery is performed.
- **Ignored networks** - This network will be ignored and device discovery will not be performed on it.
- **All** - Both monitored and ignored networks will be displayed. 


### Configure the network monitor state
You control where device discovery takes place. Monitored networks is where device discovery will be performed and are typically corporate networks. You can also choose to ignore networks or select the initial discovery classification after modifying a state. 

Choosing the initial discovery classification means applying the default system-made network monitor state. Selecting the default system-made network monitor state means that networks that were identified to be corporate, will be monitored, and ones identified as non-corporate, will be ignored automatically.
 
1. Select **Settings > Device discovery**.
2. Select **Monitored networks**. 
3. View the list of networks. 
4. Select the three dots next to the network name. 
5. Choose whether you want to monitor, ignore, or use the initial discovery classification. 
    
    > [!WARNING]
    >- Choosing to monitor a network that was not identified by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as a corporate network can cause device discovery outside of your corporate network, and may therefore detect home or other non-corporate devices. 
    > - Choosing to ignore a network will stop monitoring and discovering devices in that network. Devices that were already discovered will not be removed from the inventory, but will no longer be updated, and details will be retained until the data retention period of the Defender for Endpoint expires.
    > - Before choosing to monitor non-corporate networks, you must ensure you have permission to do so. <br>


6. Confirm that you want to make the change. 


## Explore devices in the network

You can use the following advanced hunting query to get more context about each network name described in the networks list. The query lists all the onboarded devices that were connected to a certain network within the last 7 days.



```kusto
DeviceNetworkInfo
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
| where ConnectedNetworks  != ""
| extend ConnectedNetworksExp = parse_json(ConnectedNetworks)
| mv-expand bagexpansion = array ConnectedNetworks=ConnectedNetworksExp
| extend NetworkName = tostring(ConnectedNetworks ["Name"]), Description = tostring(ConnectedNetworks ["Description"]), NetworkCategory = tostring(ConnectedNetworks ["Category"])
| where NetworkName == "<your network name here>"


```
