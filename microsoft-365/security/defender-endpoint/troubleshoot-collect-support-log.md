       - Result package approximate size: ~10Mb

    ```

>[!NOTE]
> - The latest preview version of MDEClientAnalyzer can be downloaded here: [https://aka.ms/Betamdeanalyzer](https://aka.ms/Betamdeanalyzer).
> 
> - The LiveAnalyzer script downloads the troubleshooting package on the destination machine from: https://mdatpclientanalyzer.blob.core.windows.net.
> 
>   If you cannot allow the machine to reach the above URL, then upload MDEClientAnalyzerPreview.zip file to the library before running the LiveAnalyzer script:
>
>   ```console
>   PutFile MDEClientAnalyzerPreview.zip -overwrite
>   Run MDELiveAnalyzer.ps1
>   GetFile "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\Downloads\MDEClientAnalyzerResult.zip" -auto
>   ```
> 
> - For more information on gathering data locally on a machine in case the machine isn't communicating with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud services, or does not appear in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal as expected, see [Verify client connectivity to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service URLs](configure-proxy-internet.md#verify-client-connectivity-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls).
