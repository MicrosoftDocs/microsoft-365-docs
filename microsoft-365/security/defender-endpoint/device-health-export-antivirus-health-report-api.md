This API has two methods to retrieve Microsoft Defender Antivirus device antivirus health details:

- **Method one:** [1 Export health reporting \(**JSON response**\)](#1-export-health-reporting-json-response)  The method pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for _small organizations with less than 100-K devices_. The response is paginated, so you can use the \@odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.

- **Method two:** [2 Export health reporting \(**via files**\)](#2-export-health-reporting-via-files) This method enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows:
  - Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.
  - Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.

Data that is collected using either '_JSON response_ or _via files_' is the current snapshot of the current state. It doesn't contain historic data. To collect historic data, customers must save the data in their own data storages. See [Export device health details API methods and properties](device-health-api-methods-properties.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Currently, only the **Antivirus Health JSON Response** is generally available. **Antivirus Health API via files** is currently only available in public preview.
>
> **Advanced Hunting custom query** is currently only available in public preview, even if the queries are still visible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2 and Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2016 to appear in device health reports, these devices must be onboarded using the modern unified solution package. For more information, see [New functionality in the modern unified solution for Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution).

> [!TIP]
> **Performance tip** Due to a variety of factors (examples listed below) Microsoft Defender Antivirus, like other antivirus software, can cause performance issues on endpoint devices. In some cases, you might need to tune the performance of Microsoft Defender Antivirus to alleviate those performance issues. Microsoft's **Performance analyzer** is a PowerShell command-line tool that helps determine which files, file paths, processes, and file extensions might be causing performance issues; some examples are:
>
> - Top paths that impact scan time
> - Top files that impact scan time
> - Top processes that impact scan time
> - Top file extensions that impact scan time
> - Combinations – for example:
>   - top files per extension
>   - top paths per extension
>   - top processes per path
>   - top scans per file
>   - top scans per file per process
>
> You can use the information gathered using Performance analyzer to better assess performance issues and apply remediation actions. 
> See: [Performance analyzer for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](tune-performance-defender-antivirus.md).
