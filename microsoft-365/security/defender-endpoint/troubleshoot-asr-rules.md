# Report and troubleshoot Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ASR Rules

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> is the new interface for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. Here you can easily view the security health of your organization, act to configure devices, users, and apps, and get alerts for suspicious activity. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is intended for security admins and security operations teams to better manage and protect their organization. Visit the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank"><https://security.microsoft.com></a>.

In <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, we offer you a complete look at the current ASR rules configuration and events in your estate. Note that your devices must be onboarded into the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service for these reports to be populated.
Here's a screenshot from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (under **Reports** \> **Devices** \> **Attack surface reduction**). At the device level, select **Configuration** from the **Attack surface reduction rules** pane. The following screen is displayed, where you can select a specific device and check its individual ASR rule configuration.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Advanced hunting

One of the most powerful features of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is advanced hunting. If you're unfamiliar with advanced hunting, refer [proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md).

Advanced hunting is a query-based (Kusto Query Language) threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of the captured (raw) data, that Defender for Endpoint collects from your devices. Through advanced hunting, you can proactively inspect events to locate interesting indicators and entities. The flexible access to data helps unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.

Through advanced hunting, it's possible to extract ASR rules information, create reports, and get in-depth information on the context of a given ASR rule audit or block event.

ASR rules events are available to be queried from the DeviceEvents table in the advanced hunting section of the Microsoft 365 Defender. For example, a simple query such as the one below can report all the events that have ASR rules as data source, for the last 30 days, and will summarize them by the ActionType count, that in this case it will be the actual codename of the ASR rule.

:::image type="content" source="images/adv-hunt-sc-2new.png" alt-text="The Advanced hunting page" lightbox="images/adv-hunt-sc-2new.png":::

With advanced hunting you can shape the queries to your liking, so that you can see what is happening, regardless of whether you want to pinpoint something on an individual machine, or you want to extract insights from your entire environment.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint machine timeline

An alternative to advanced hunting, but with a narrower scope, is the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint machine timeline. You can view all the collected events of a device, for the past six months, in the Microsoft 365 Defender, by going to the Machines list, select a given machine, and then click on the Timeline tab.

Pictured below is a screenshot of the Timeline view of these events on a given endpoint. From this view, you can filter the events list based on any of the Event Groups along the right-side pane. You can also enable or disable Flagged and Verbose events while viewing alerts and scrolling through the historical timeline.

## How to troubleshoot ASR rules?

The first and most immediate way is to check locally, on a Windows device, which ASR rules are enabled (and their configuration) is by using the PowerShell cmdlets.

Here are a few other sources of information that Windows offers, to troubleshoot ASR rules' impact and operation.

### Querying which rules are active

One of the easiest ways to determine if ASR rules are already enabled is through a PowerShell cmdlet, Get-MpPreference.

Here's an example:

:::image type="content" source="images/getmpreferencescriptnew.png" alt-text="The get mppreference script" lightbox="images/getmpreferencescriptnew.png":::

There are multiple ASR rules active, with different configured actions.

To expand the above information on ASR rules, you can use the properties **AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids** and/or **AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions**.

Example:

```powershell
Get-MPPreference | Select-Object -ExpandProperty**AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids
```

:::image type="content" source="images/getmpref-examplenew.png" alt-text="The get mpreference example" lightbox="images/getmpref-examplenew.png":::

The above shows all the IDs for ASR rules that have a setting different from 0 (Not Configured).

The next step is then to list the actual actions (Block or Audit) that each rule is configured with.

```powershell
Get-MPPreference | Select-Object -ExpandProperty**AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions
```

:::image type="content" source="images/getmpref-example2new.png" alt-text="The get mppreference example2" lightbox="images/getmpref-example2new.png":::

### Querying blocking and auditing events

ASR rule events can be viewed within the Windows Defender log.

To access it, open Windows Event Viewer, and browse to **Applications and Services Logs** \> **Microsoft** \> **Windows** \> **Windows Defender** \> **Operational**.

:::image type="content" source="images/eventviewerscrnew.png" alt-text="The Event Viewer page" lightbox="images/eventviewerscrnew.png":::

## Microsoft Defender Antimalware Protection Logs

You can also view rule events through the Microsoft Defender Antivirus dedicated command-line tool, called `*mpcmdrun.exe*`, that can be used to manage and configure, and automate tasks if needed.

You can find this utility in *%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe*. You must run it from an elevated command prompt (that is, run as Admin).

To generate the support information, type *MpCmdRun.exe -getfiles*. After a while, several logs will be packaged into an archive (MpSupportFiles.cab) and made available in *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support*.

:::image type="content" source="images/malware-prot-logsnew.png" alt-text="The malware protection logs" lightbox="images/malware-prot-logsnew.png":::

Extract that archive and you'll have many files available for troubleshooting purposes.

The most relevant files are as follows:

- **MPOperationalEvents.txt**: This file contains same level of information found in Event Viewer for Windows Defender's Operational log.
- **MPRegistry.txt**: In this file you can analyze all the current Windows Defender configurations, from the moment the support logs were captured.
- **MPLog.txt**: This log contains more verbose information about all the actions/operations of the Windows Defender.
