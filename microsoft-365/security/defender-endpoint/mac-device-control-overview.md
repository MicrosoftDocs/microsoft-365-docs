## Device Control for macOS properties

The Device Control for macOS includes global setting, group creation and access policy rule creation:

- Global setting called ‘settings’ allows you to define the global environment.
- Group called ‘groups’ allows you to create media groups. For example, authorized USB group or encrypted USB group.
- Access policy rule called ‘rules’ allows you to create policy to restrict each group. For example, only allow authorized user to Write access-authorized USB group.

Here are the properties you can use when you create the group and policy.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you use the examples on the GitHub to understand the properties: [mdatp-devicecontrol/Removable Storage Access Control Samples/macOS/policy at main · microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/macOS/policy). You can also use the scripts at [mdatp-devicecontrol/Removable Storage Access Control Samples/macOS/policy/scripts at main · microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/macOS/policy/scripts) to translate Windows Device Control policy to macOS Device Control policy or translate macOS Device Control V1 policy to this V2 policy.

### Settings

|:---|:---|:---|
| features | Feature specific configurations | You can set ‘disable’ false/true for following features: <br> <ul><li>removableMedia</li><li>appleDevice</li><li>portableDevice, including camera or PTP media</li><li>bluetoothDevice</li></ul> <br> Default is true, so if you do not configure this value, even you create custom policy for removableMedia, system will not apply because it is disabled by default. |
| global | Set default enforcement  | You can set **defaultEnforcement**: <br> <ul><li>allow: _default_</li><li>deny</li></ul> |
| ux | You can set hyperlink on notification. | navigationTarget: string, for example, "http://www.microsoft.com". |

### Group

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $type | The kind of group | “device” |

### Query

Device Control supports two kinds of queries:

Query type 1 is as follows:

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $type | Identify the logical operation to perform on the clauses | **all**: Any attributes under the **clauses** will be an _And_ relationship. For example, if the administrator puts `vendorId` and `serialNumber`, for every connected USB, the system will check to see whether the USB meets both values.<br> **and**: is equivalent to _all_ <br> **any:** The attributes under the **clauses** will be _Or_ relationship. For example, if administrator puts `vendorId` and `serialNumber`, for every connected USB, system will do the enforcement as long as the USB has either an identical `vendorId` or `serialNumber` value. <br> **or**: is equivalent to _any_ |
| clauses | Use media device property to set group condition. | An array of clause objects which are evaluated to determine group membership. See the [Clause](#clause) section below. |

Query type 2 is as follows:

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $type | Identify the logical operation to perform on the subquery | not: logical negation of a query |
| query | A subquery | **A query which will be negated.** |

| name | String, the name of the policy and will display on the toast based on the policy setting. | |
| includeGroups | The group(s) that the policy will be applied to. If multiple groups are specified, the policy will be applied to any media in all those groups.  If not specified, the rule will be applied to all devices. | The **id** value inside the group must be used at this instance. If there are multiple groups in the `includeGroups`, it will be _AND_. <br> `"includeGroups": ["3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e217"]` |

## Enduser experience

Once Deny happens and the notification is enabled in the policy, the end user will see a dialog:

:::image type="content" source="images/macos-device-control-enduser-experience-dialog.png" alt-text="Shows a Device Control Dialog that indicates the USB device is restricted" lightbox="images/macos-device-control-enduser-experience-dialog.png":::

## Reporting

You will be able to see the policy event on Advanced hunting and Device Control report. For more details, see [Protect your organization's data with Device Control](device-control-report.md).

## Scenarios

Here are some common scenarios to help you familiarize with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Device Control.

### Scenario 1: Deny any removable media but allow specific USBs

In this scenario, you need to create two groups: one group for any removable medias, and another group for approved USBs group. You also need to create an access policy rule.

#### Step 1: Settings: enable Device Control and set Default Enforcement

```json
    "settings": { 

        "features": { 

            "removableMedia": { 

                "disable": false 

            } 

        }, 

        "global": { 

            "defaultEnforcement": "allow" 

        }, 

        "ux": { 

            "navigationTarget": "http://www.deskhelp.com" 

        } 

    } 
```

#### Step 2: Groups: Create any removable media group and approved-USBs group

-1. Create a group to cover any removable media devices
-1. Create a group for approved USBs
-1. Combine those groups into one ‘groups’

```json
"groups": [ 

        { 

            "type": "device", 

            "id": "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e211", 

            "name": "All Removable Media Devices", 

            "query": { 

                "$type": "all", 

                "clauses": [ 

                    { 

                        "$type": "primaryId", 

                        "value": "removable_media_devices" 

                    } 

                ] 

            } 

        }, 

        { 

            "type": "device", 

            "id": "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e212", 

            "name": "Kingston Devices", 

            "query": { 

                "$type": "all", 

                "clauses": [ 

                    { 

                        "$type": "vendorId", 

                        "value": "0951" 

                    } 

                ] 

            } 

        } 

    ] 
```

#### Step 3: Rules: Create Deny policy for unallowed USBs

Create access policy rule and put into ‘rules’:

```json
   "rules": [ 

        { 

            "id": "772cef80-229f-48b4-bd17-a69130092981", 

            "name": "Deny RWX to all Removable Media Devices except Kingston", 

            "includeGroups": [ 

                "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e211" 

            ], 

            "excludeGroups": [ 

                "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e212" 

            ], 

            "entries": [ 

                { 

                    "$type": "removableMedia", 

                    "id": "A7CEE2F8-CE34-4B34-9CFE-4133F0361035", 

                    "enforcement": { 

                        "$type": "deny" 

                    }, 

                    "access": [ 

                        "read", 

                        "write", 

                        "execute" 

                    ] 

                }, 

                { 

                    "$type": "removableMedia", 

                    "id": "18BA3DD5-4C9A-458B-A756-F1499FE94FB4", 

                    "enforcement": { 

                        "$type": "auditDeny", 

                        "options": [ 

                            "send_event", 

                            "show_notification" 

                        ] 

                    }, 

                    "access": [ 

                        "read", 

                        "write", 

                        "execute" 

                    ] 

                } 

            ] 

        } 

    ] 
```

In this case, only have one access rule policy, but if you have multiple, make sure add all into ‘rules’.
