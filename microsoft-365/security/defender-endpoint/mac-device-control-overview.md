- Manage iOS and Portable devices, and Apple APFS encrypted devices and Bluetooth media, with or without exclusions.

## Prepare your endpoints

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint entitlement (can be trial)
- Minimum OS version: macOS 11 or higher
- Deploy Full Disk Access: you may already have been previously created and deployed this [https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/profiles/fulldisk.mobileconfig](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/macos/mobileconfig/profiles/fulldisk.mobileconfig) for other MDE features. You need to grant Full Disk Access permission for a new application: `com.microsoft.dlp.daemon`.
- Enable Device Control on the MDE Preference setting:

   Data Loss Prevention (DLP)/Features/

   For **Feature Name**, enter "DC_in_dlp"

   For **State**, enter "enabled"

## Device Control for macOS properties

The Device Control for macOS includes global setting, group creation and access policy rule creation:

- Global setting called 'settings' allows you to define the global environment.
- Group called 'groups' allows you to create media groups. For example, authorized USB group or encrypted USB group.
- Access policy rule called 'rules' allows you to create policy to restrict each group. For example, only allow authorized user to Write access-authorized USB group.

Here are the properties you can use when you create the group and policy.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you use the examples on the GitHub to understand the properties: [mdatp-devicecontrol/Removable Storage Access Control Samples/macOS/policy at main - microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/macOS/policy). 
> 
> You can also use the scripts at [mdatp-devicecontrol/Removable Storage Access Control Samples/macOS/policy/scripts at main - microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/macOS/policy/scripts) to translate Windows Device Control policy to macOS Device Control policy or translate macOS Device Control V1 policy to this V2 policy.

>[!WARNING]
>In macOS Sonoma 14.3.1, Apple made a change to the [handling of Bluetooth devices](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/738748) that impacts Defender for Endpoint device controls ability to intercept and block access to Bluetooth devices.  At this time, the recommended mitigation is to use a version of macOS less than 14.3.1.

### Settings

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| features | Feature specific configurations | You can set `disable` to false or true for following features: <br/>- `removableMedia`<br/>- `appleDevice`<br/>- `portableDevice`, including camera or PTP media<br/>- `bluetoothDevice`<br/><br/>The default is `true`, so if you don't configure this value, it will not apply even if you create a custom policy for `removableMedia`, because it's disabled by default. |
| global | Set default enforcement  | You can set `defaultEnforcement` to<br/>- `allow` (_default_)<br/>- `deny` |
| ux | You can set a hyperlink on notification. | `navigationTarget: string`. Example: `"http://www.microsoft.com"` |

### Group

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `$type` | The kind of group | "device" |
| `id` | GUID, a unique ID, represents the group and will be used in the policy. | You can generate the ID through [New-Guid (Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility) - PowerShell](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-guid?view=powershell-7.2&preserve-view=true) or the uuidgen command on macOS |
| `name` | Friendly name for the group. | string |
| `query` | The media coverage under this group | See the **query** properties tables below for details. |

### Query

Device Control supports two kinds of queries:

Query type 1 is as follows:

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `$type` | Identify the logical operation to perform on the clauses | **all**: Any attributes under the **clauses** are an _And_ relationship. For example, if the administrator puts `vendorId` and `serialNumber`, for every connected USB, the system checks to see whether the USB meets both values.<br> **and**: is equivalent to _all_ <br> **any:** The attributes under the **clauses** are _Or_ relationship. For example, if administrator puts `vendorId` and `serialNumber`, for every connected USB, system does the enforcement as long as the USB has either an identical `vendorId` or `serialNumber` value. <br> **or**: is equivalent to _any_ |
| `clauses` | Use media device property to set group condition. | An array of clause objects that are evaluated to determine group membership. See the [Clause](#clause) section below. |

Query type 2 is as follows:

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `$type` | Identify the logical operation to perform on the subquery | not: logical negation of a query |
| `query` | A subquery | **A query which will be negated.** |

### Clause

#### Clause properties

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `$type` | The type of clause | See the following table for supported clauses. |
| `value` | $type specific value to use | |

#### Supported clauses

| clause $type | value | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `primaryId` | One of: <br>- `apple_devices`<br>- `removable_media_devices` <br>- `portable_devices` <br>- `bluetooth_devices` | |
| `vendorId` | 4 digit hexadecimal string | Matches a device's vendor ID |

| `serialNumber` | string | Matches a device's serial number. Doesn't match if the device doesn't have a serial number. |
| `encryption` | apfs | Match if a device is apfs-encrypted. |
| `groupId` | UUID string | Match if a device is a member of another group. The value represents the UUID of the group to match against. <br> The group must be defined within the policy prior to the clause. |

### Access policy rule

| Property name | Description | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | GUID, a unique ID, represents the rule and will be used in the policy. | New-Guid (Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility) - PowerShell <br> uuidgen |
| `name` | String, the name of the policy and will display on the toast based on the policy setting. | |
| `includeGroups` | The group(s) that the policy will be applied to. If multiple groups are specified, the policy applies to any media in all those groups. If not specified, the rule applies to all devices. | The **id** value inside the group must be used in this instance. If multiple groups are in the `includeGroups`, it's _AND_. <br/> `"includeGroups": ["3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e217"]` |
| `excludeGroups` | The group(s) that the policy doesn't apply to. | The **id** value inside the group must be used in this instance. If multiple groups are in the excludeGroups, it's _OR_. |

## End-user experience

Once Deny happens and the notification is enabled in the policy, the end user sees a dialog:

:::image type="content" source="images/macos-device-control-enduser-experience-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a Device Control Dialog that indicates the USB device is restricted" lightbox="images/macos-device-control-enduser-experience-dialog.png":::

## Status

Use `mdatp health --details device_control` to inspect the Device Control status:

```console
active                                      : ["v2"]
v1_configured                               : false
v1_enforcement_level                        : unavailable
v2_configured                               : true
v2_state                                    : "enabled"
v2_sensor_connection                        : "created_ok"
v2_full_disk_access                         : "approved"
```

- `active` - feature version, you should see ["v2"]. (Device Control is enabled, but not configured.)
    - [] - Device Control is not configured on this machine
    - ["v1"] - You are on a preview version of Device Control. Please migrate to version 2 using this guide. v1 is considered obsolete and not described in this documentation.
    - ["v1","v2"] - You have both v1 and v2 enabled. Please offboard from v1.
- `v1_configured` - v1 configuration is applied
- `v1_enforcement_level` - when v1 is enabled
- `v2_configured` - v2 configuration is applied
- `v2_state` - v2 status, `enabled` if fully working
- `v2_sensor_connection` - if `created_ok`, then Device Control established connection to the system extension
- `v2_full_disk_access` - if not `approved`, then Device Control cannot prevent some or all operations

## Reporting

You'll be able to see the policy event on Advanced hunting and Device Control report. For more information, see [Protect your organization's data with Device Control](device-control-report.md).

## Scenarios

Here are some common scenarios to help you familiarize with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Device Control.

### Scenario 1: Deny any removable media but allow specific USBs

In this scenario, you need to create two groups: one group for any removable media, and another group for approved USBs group. You also need to create an access policy rule.

#### Step 1: Settings: enable Device Control and set Default Enforcement

```json
    "settings": { 

        "features": { 

            "removableMedia": { 

                "disable": false 

            } 

        }, 

        "global": { 

            "defaultEnforcement": "allow" 

        }, 

        "ux": { 

            "navigationTarget": "http://www.deskhelp.com" 

        } 

    } 
```

#### Step 2: Groups: Create any removable media group and approved-USBs group

-1. Create a group to cover any removable media devices
-1. Create a group for approved USBs
-1. Combine those groups into one 'groups'

```json
"groups": [ 

        { 

            "type": "device", 

            "id": "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e211", 

            "name": "All Removable Media Devices", 

            "query": { 

                "$type": "all", 

                "clauses": [ 

                    { 

                        "$type": "primaryId", 

                        "value": "removable_media_devices" 

                    } 

                ] 

            } 

        }, 

        { 

            "type": "device", 

            "id": "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e212", 

            "name": "Kingston Devices", 

            "query": { 

                "$type": "all", 

                "clauses": [ 

                    { 

                        "$type": "vendorId", 

                        "value": "0951" 

                    } 

                ] 

            } 

        } 

    ] 
```

#### Step 3: Rules: Create Deny policy for unallowed USBs

Create access policy rule and put into 'rules':

```json
   "rules": [ 

        { 

            "id": "772cef80-229f-48b4-bd17-a69130092981", 

            "name": "Deny RWX to all Removable Media Devices except Kingston", 

            "includeGroups": [ 

                "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e211" 

            ], 

            "excludeGroups": [ 

                "3f082cd3-f701-4c21-9a6a-ed115c28e212" 

            ], 

            "entries": [ 

                { 

                    "$type": "removableMedia", 

                    "id": "A7CEE2F8-CE34-4B34-9CFE-4133F0361035", 

                    "enforcement": { 

                        "$type": "deny" 

                    }, 

                    "access": [ 

                        "read", 

                        "write", 

                        "execute" 

                    ] 

                }, 

                { 

                    "$type": "removableMedia", 

                    "id": "18BA3DD5-4C9A-458B-A756-F1499FE94FB4", 

                    "enforcement": { 

                        "$type": "auditDeny", 

                        "options": [ 

                            "send_event", 

                            "show_notification" 

                        ] 

                    }, 

                    "access": [ 

                        "read", 

                        "write", 

                        "execute" 

                    ] 

                } 

            ] 

        } 

    ] 
```

In this case, only have one access rule policy, but if you have multiple, make sure to add all into 'rules'.
