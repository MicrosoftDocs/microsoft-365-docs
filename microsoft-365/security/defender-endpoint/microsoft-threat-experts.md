> Threat Experts is not currently available in the Microsoft 365 for U.S. Government clouds.

Contact your account team or Microsoft representative to subscribe to **Microsoft Threat Experts - Experts on Demand** to consult with our threat experts on relevant detections and adversaries that your organization is facing.

See [Configure Microsoft Threat Experts capabilities](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-microsoft-threat-experts#before-you-begin) for details.

## Endpoint attack notification

Endpoint Attack Notifications (previously referred to as Microsoft Threat Experts - Targeted Attack Notification) provides proactive hunting for the most important threats to your network, including human adversary intrusions, hands-on-keyboard attacks, or advanced attacks like cyber-espionage. These notifications show up as a new alert. The managed hunting service includes:

- Threat monitoring and analysis, reducing dwell time and risk to the business
- Hunter-trained artificial intelligence to discover and prioritize both known and unknown attacks
- Identifying the most important risks, helping SOCs maximize time and energy
- Scope of compromise and as much context as can be quickly delivered to enable fast SOC response.

## Microsoft Threat Experts - Experts on Demand
> [!NOTE]
> Experts on Demand is not a security incident response service. Itâ€™s intended to provide a better understanding of complex threats affecting your organization. Engage with your own security incident response team to address urgent security incident response issues. If you don't have your own security incident response team and would like Microsoft's help, create a support request in the [Premier Services Hub](/services-hub/).

Customers can engage our security experts directly from within Microsoft 365 Defender portal to get their response. Experts provide insights needed to better understand the complex threats affecting your organization, from alert inquiries, potentially compromised devices, root cause of a suspicious network connection, to more threat intelligence regarding ongoing advanced persistent threat campaigns. With this capability, you can:

- Get more clarification on alerts including root cause or scope of the incident
- Gain clarity into suspicious device behavior and next steps if faced with an advanced attacker
- Determine risk and protection regarding threat actors, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques

> [!NOTE]
> As of August 2022, the Experts on Demand option to **Consult a threat expert** has been rebranded to **Ask Defender Experts**.

The option to **Ask Defender Experts** is available in several places in the portal so you can engage with experts in the context of your investigation:

- ***Device page actions menu***
