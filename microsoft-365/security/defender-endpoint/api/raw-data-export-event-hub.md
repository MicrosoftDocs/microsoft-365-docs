## Before you begin

1. Create an [event hub](/azure/event-hubs/) in your tenant.

2. Log in to your [Azure tenant](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), go to **Subscriptions > Your subscription > Resource Providers > Register to Microsoft.insights**.

## Enable raw data streaming

1. Log in to the [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://security.microsoft.com) as a ***Global Administrator*** or ***Security Administrator***.

2. Go to the [Data export settings page](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/defender/raw_data_export) in the Microsoft Defender portal.

3. Click on **Add data export settings**.

4. Choose a name for your new settings.

5. Choose **Forward events to Azure Event Hubs**.

6. Type your **Event Hubs name** and your **Event Hubs resource ID**.

> [!NOTE]
> Leaving Event Hubs name as empty will create an event hub for each category in the selected namespace. Event Hubs namespaces have a limit of 10 Event Hubs if you are not using a Dedicated Event Hubs Cluster.

   In order to get your **Event Hubs resource ID**, go to your Azure Event Hubs namespace page on [Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) > properties tab \> copy the text under **Resource ID**:

7. Choose the events you want to stream and click **Save**.

## The schema of the events in Azure Event Hubs

```json
{
    "records": [
                    {
                        "time": "<The time WDATP received the event>"
                        "tenantId": "<The Id of the tenant that the event belongs to>"
                        "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
                        "properties": { <WDATP Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
                    }
                    ...
                ]
}
```

- Each event hub message in Azure Event Hubs contains list of records.

- Each record contains the event name, the time Microsoft Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you will only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "**properties**".

- For more information about the schema of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint events, see [Advanced Hunting overview](../advanced-hunting-overview.md).

- In Advanced Hunting, the **DeviceInfo** table has a column named **MachineGroup** which contains the group of the device. Here every event will be decorated with this column as well. See [Device Groups](../machine-groups.md) for more information.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.  

## Data types mapping

To get the data types for event properties do the following:

1. Log in to [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://security.microsoft.com) and go to [Advanced Hunting page](https://security.microsoft.com/hunting-package).

2. Run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event:

   ```kusto
   {EventType}
   | getschema
   | project ColumnName, ColumnType 
   ```

- Here is an example for Device Info event:
