## API description

Updates properties of existing [Machine](machine.md).

Updatable properties are: `machineTags` and `deviceValue`.

## Limitations

1. You can update machines that are available in the API. 
2. Update machine only appends tags to the tag collection. If tags exist, they must be included in the tags collection in the body.
3. Rate limitations for this API are 100 calls per minute and 1500 calls per hour.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs](apis-intro.md)

Permission type|Permission|Permission display name
:---|:---|:---
Application|Machine.ReadWrite.All|'Read and write machine information for all machines'
Delegated (work or school account)|Machine.ReadWrite|'Read and write machine information'

> [!NOTE]
> When obtaining a token using user credentials:
> - The user needs to have at least the following role permission: 'Alerts investigation'. For more information, see [Create and manage roles](../user-roles.md).
> - The user needs to have access to the device associated with the alert, based on device group settings. For more information, see [Create and manage device groups](../machine-groups.md).
>
