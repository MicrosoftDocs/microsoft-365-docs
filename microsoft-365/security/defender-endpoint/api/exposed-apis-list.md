## Endpoint URI and versioning

### Endpoint URI

> The service base URI is: [https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com](https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com)
>
> The queries based OData have the '/api' prefix. For example, to get Alerts you can send GET request to [https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts](https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts)

### Versioning

> The API supports versioning.
>
> The current version is **V1.0**.
>
> To use a specific version, use this format: `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/{Version}`. For example: `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/v1.0/alerts`
>
> If you don't specify any version (e.g. `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts`) you will get to the latest version.
