For a production deployment, we recommend using Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, or Intune.    |
| Windows Server 2016 <p>Windows Server 2012 R2 <p>Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1  | [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](configure-server-endpoints.md)<p>[Azure Defender](/azure/security-center/security-center-wdatp) |
| macOS:<p>11.3.1 (Big Sur) <p>10.15 (Catalina)<p>10.14 (Mojave) | [Onboard non-Windows devices](configure-endpoints-non-windows.md)  |
| iOS | [Onboard non-Windows devices](configure-endpoints-non-windows.md)  |
| Linux:<p>RHEL 7.2+<p>CentOS Linux 7.2+<p>Ubuntu 16 LTS, or higher LTS<p>SLES 12+<p>Debian 9+<p>Oracle Linux 7.2 | [Onboard non-Windows devices](configure-endpoints-non-windows.md)  |

## Run a detection test

To verify that your onboarded devices are properly connected to Defender for Endpoint, you can run a detection test.

|Operating system  |Guidance  |
|---------|---------|
| Windows 10 <p>Windows Server 2019 <p>Windows Server, version 1803 <p>Windows Server 2016 <p>Windows Server 2012 R2     | See [Run a detection test](run-detection-test.md). <p>Visit the Defender for Endpoint demo scenarios site ([https://demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com)) and try one or more of the scenarios. For example, try the **Cloud-delivered protection** demo scenario.    |
| macOS:<p>11.3.1 (Big Sur) <p>10.15 (Catalina)<p>10.14 (Mojave)    | Download and use the DIY app at [https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy](https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy). <p>For more information, see [Defender for Endpoint on macOS](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md).        |
| Linux:<p>RHEL 7.2+<p>CentOS Linux 7.2+<p>Ubuntu 16 LTS, or higher LTS<p>SLES 12+<p>Debian 9+<p>Oracle Linux 7.2 | 1. Run the following command, and look for a result of **1**: <br/>`mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled`. <p>2. Open a Terminal window, and run the following command: <br/>`curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt`. <p>3. Run the following command to list any detected threats: <br/>`mdatp threat list`. <p>For more information, see [Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md). |

## Confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in passive mode on your endpoints

Now that your endpoints have been onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, your next step is to make sure Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. You can use either Command Prompt or PowerShell to perform this task, as described in the following table:

| Method  | What to do  |
|:-------|:-------|
|Command Prompt     | 1. On a Windows device, open Command Prompt as an administrator.<p>2. Type `sc query windefend`, and then press Enter.<p>3. Review the results to confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode.         |
| PowerShell     | 1. On a Windows device, open Windows PowerShell as an administrator.<p>2. Run the [Get-MpComputerStatus](/powershell/module/defender/Get-MpComputerStatus) cmdlet. <p>3. In the list of results, look for either **AMRunningMode: Passive Mode** or **AMRunningMode: SxS Passive Mode**.    |

> [!NOTE]
> You might see *Windows Defender Antivirus* instead of *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* in some versions of Windows.

### Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server to passive mode manually

To set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, or Windows Server 2019, follow these steps:

1. Open Registry Editor, and then navigate to <br/>
   `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.

2. Edit (or create) a DWORD entry called **ForceDefenderPassiveMode**, and specify the following settings:
   - Set the DWORD's value to **1**.
   - Under **Base**, select **Hexadecimal**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use other methods to set the registry key, such as the following:
>- [Group Policy Preference](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn581922(v=ws.11))
>- [Local Group Policy Object tool](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool)
>- [A package in Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs)

### Start Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2016

If you are using Windows Server 2016, you might have to start Microsoft Defender Antivirus manually. You can do this by using the PowerShell cmdlet `mpcmdrun.exe -wdenable` on the device.

## Get updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date is critical to assure your devices have the latest technology and features needed to protect against new malware and attack techniques, even if Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. (See [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).)

There are two types of updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date:

- Security intelligence updates
- Product updates

To get your updates, follow the guidance in [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

## Uninstall your non-Microsoft solution

If at this point you have:

- Onboarded your organization's devices to Defender for Endpoint, and 
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus is installed and enabled, 

Then your next step is to uninstall your non-Microsoft endpoint protection solution. 

To get help with this task, reach out to your solution provider's technical support team.

## Make sure Defender for Endpoint is working correctly

Now that you have onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, and you have uninstalled your former non-Microsoft solution, your next step is to make sure that Defender for Endpoint working correctly. One good way to do this is by visiting the Defender for Endpoint demo scenarios site ([https://demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com)). Try one or more of the demo scenarios on that page, including at least the following:

- Cloud-delivered protection
- Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA)
- Network Protection (NP)
