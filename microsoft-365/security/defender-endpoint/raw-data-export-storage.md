# Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to stream Advanced Hunting events to your Storage account

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)

> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-configuresiem-abovefoldlink) 

## Before you begin

1. Create a [Storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) in your tenant.

2. Log in to your [Azure tenant](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), go to **Subscriptions > Your subscription > Resource Providers > Register to Microsoft.insights**.

## Enable raw data streaming

1. Log in to [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal](https://securitycenter.windows.com) as a ***Global Administrator*** or ***Security Administrator***.

2. Go to [Data export settings page](https://securitycenter.windows.com/interoperability/dataexport) on Microsoft Defender Security Center.

3. Click on **Add data export settings**.

4. Choose a name for your new settings.

5. Choose **Forward events to Azure Storage**.

6. Type your **Storage Account Resource ID**. In order to get your **Storage Account Resource ID**, go to your Storage account page on [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) > properties tab > copy the text under **Storage account resource ID**:

7. Choose the events you want to stream and click **Save**.

## The schema of the events in the Storage account

- A blob container will be created for each event type:

- The schema of each row in a blob is the following JSON: 

  ```
  {
          "time": "<The time WDATP received the event>"
          "tenantId": "<Your tenant ID>"
          "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
          "properties": { <WDATP Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
  }               
  ```

- Each blob contains multiple rows.

- Each row contains the event name, the time Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you will only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "properties".

- For more information about the schema of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint events, see [Advanced Hunting overview](advanced-hunting-overview.md).

- In Advanced Hunting, the **DeviceInfo** table has a column named **MachineGroup** which contains the group of the device. Here every event will be decorated with this column as well. See [Device Groups](machine-groups.md) for more information.

## Data types mapping

In order to get the data types for our events properties do the following:

1. Log in to [Microsoft Defender Security Center](https://securitycenter.windows.com) and go to [Advanced Hunting page](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting-package).

2. Run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event: 

   ```
   {EventType}
   | getschema
   | project ColumnName, ColumnType 
   ```

- Here is an example for Device Info event:
