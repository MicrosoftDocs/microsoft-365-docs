# Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)

> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-advancedhunting-abovefoldlink)

Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.

Watch this video for a quick overview of advanced hunting and a short tutorial that will get you started fast.

You can use the same threat-hunting queries to build custom detection rules. These rules run automatically to check for and then respond to suspected breach activity, misconfigured machines, and other findings.

> [!TIP]
> Use [advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview) to hunt for threats using data from Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Defender for Identity. [Turn on Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-enable).

## Data freshness and update frequency

Advanced hunting data can be categorized into two distinct types, each consolidated differently.

- **Event or activity data**: Populates tables about alerts, security events, system events, and routine assessments. Advanced hunting receives this data almost immediately after the sensors that collect them successfully transmit them to Defender for Endpoint.
- **Entity data**: Populates tables with consolidated information about users and devices. This data comes from both relatively static data sources and dynamic sources, such as Active Directory entries and event logs. To provide fresh data, tables are updated with any new information every 15 minutes, adding rows that might not be fully populated. Every 24 hours, data is consolidated to insert a record that contains the latest, most comprehensive data set about each entity.

## Time zone

Time information in advanced hunting is currently in the UTC time zone.
