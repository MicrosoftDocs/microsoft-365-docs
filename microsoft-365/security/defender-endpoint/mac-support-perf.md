This topic provides some general steps that can be used to narrow down performance issues related to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

Real-time protection (RTP) is a feature of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS that continuously monitors and protects your device against threats. It consists of file and process monitoring and other heuristics.

Depending on the applications that you're running and your device characteristics, you may experience suboptimal performance when running Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS. In particular, applications or system processes that access many resources over a short timespan can lead to performance issues in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

The following steps can be used to troubleshoot and mitigate these issues:

1. Disable real-time protection using one of the following methods and observe whether the performance improves. This approach helps narrow down whether Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS is contributing to the performance issues.

      If your device is not managed by your organization, real-time protection can be disabled using one of the following options:

    - From the user interface. Open Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS and navigate to **Manage settings**.

      :::image type="content" source="images/mdatp-36-rtp.png" alt-text=" The Manage real-time protection page" lightbox="images/mdatp-36-rtp.png":::
      

    - From the Terminal. For security purposes, this operation requires elevation.

      ```bash
      mdatp config real-time-protection --value disabled
      ```

      If your device is managed by your organization, real-time protection can be disabled by your administrator using the instructions in [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](mac-preferences.md).

      If the performance problem persists while real-time protection is off, the origin of the problem could be the endpoint detection and response component. In this case, please contact customer support for further instructions and mitigation.

2. Open Finder and navigate to **Applications** \> **Utilities**. Open **Activity Monitor** and analyze which applications are using the resources on your system. Typical examples include software updaters and compilers.

3. To find the applications that are triggering the most scans, you can use real-time statistics gathered by Defender for Endpoint on Mac.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This feature is available in version 100.90.70 or newer.
      This feature is enabled by default on the **Dogfood** and **InsiderFast** channels. If you're using a different update channel, this feature can be enabled from the command line:

      ```bash
      mdatp config real-time-protection-statistics  --value enabled
      ```

      This feature requires real-time protection to be enabled. To check the status of real-time protection, run the following command:

      ```bash
      mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
      ```

    Verify that the **real_time_protection_enabled** entry is true. Otherwise, run the following command to enable it:

      ```bash
      mdatp config real-time-protection --value enabled
      ```

      ```output
      Configuration property updated
      ```

      To collect current statistics, run:

      ```bash
      mdatp diagnostic real-time-protection-statistics --output json > real_time_protection.json
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > Using **--output json** (note the double dash) ensures that the output format is ready for parsing.
      The output of this command will show all processes and their associated scan activity.

4. On your Mac system, download the sample Python parser high_cpu_parser.py using the command:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/master/linux/diagnostic/high_cpu_parser.py
    ```

    The output of this command should be similar to the following:

    ```Output
    --2020-11-14 11:27:27-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft.
    mdatp-xplat/master/linus/diagnostic/high_cpu_parser.py
    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 151.101.xxx.xxx
    Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)| 151.101.xxx.xxx| :443... connected.

    Saving to: 'high_cpu_parser.py'
    100%[===========================================>] 1,020    --.-K/s   in
    0s
    ```

5. Next, type the following commands:

      ```bash
        chmod +x high_cpu_parser.py
      ```

      ```bash
        cat real_time_protection.json | python high_cpu_parser.py  > real_time_protection.log
      ```

      The output of the above is a list of the top contributors to performance issues. The first column is the process identifier (PID), the second column is te process name, and the last column is the number of scanned files, sorted by impact.

      For example, the output of the command will be something like the below:

      ```output
        ... > python ~/repo/mdatp-xplat/linux/diagnostic/high_cpu_parser.py <~Downloads/output.json | head -n 10
        27432 None 76703
        73467 actool     1249
        73914 xcodebuild 1081
        73873 bash 1050
        27475 None 836
        1    launchd    407
        73468 ibtool     344
        549  telemetryd_v1   325
        4764 None 228
        125  CrashPlanService 164
      ```

      To improve the performance of Defender for Endpoint on Mac, locate the one with the highest number under the Total files scanned row and add an exclusion for it. For more information, see [Configure and validate exclusions for Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-exclusions.md).

      > [!NOTE]
      > The application stores statistics in memory and only keeps track of file activity since it was started and real-time protection was enabled. Processes that were launched before or during periods when real time protection was off are not counted. Additionally, only events which triggered scans are counted.
      >
6. Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS with exclusions for the processes or disk locations that contribute to the performance issues and re-enable real-time protection.

     See [Configure and validate exclusions for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](mac-exclusions.md) for details.
