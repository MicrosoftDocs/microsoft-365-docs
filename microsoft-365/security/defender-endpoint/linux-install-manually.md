## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements for the current software version.

> [!WARNING]
> Upgrading your operating system to a new major version after the product installation requires the product to be reinstalled. You need to [Uninstall](linux-resources.md#uninstall) the existing Defender for Endpoint on Linux, upgrade the operating system, and then reconfigure Defender for Endpoint on Linux following the below steps.

## Configure the Linux software repository

Defender for Endpoint on Linux can be deployed from one of the following channels (denoted below as *[channel]*): *insiders-fast*, *insiders-slow*, or *prod*. Each of these channels corresponds to a Linux software repository. Instructions for configuring your device to use one of these repositories are provided below.

The choice of the channel determines the type and frequency of updates that are offered to your device. Devices in *insiders-fast* are the first ones to receive updates and new features, followed later by *insiders-slow* and lastly by *prod*.

In order to preview new features and provide early feedback, it is recommended that you configure some devices in your enterprise to use either *insiders-fast* or *insiders-slow*.

> [!WARNING]
> Switching the channel after the initial installation requires the product to be reinstalled. To switch the product channel: uninstall the existing package, re-configure your device to use the new channel, and follow the steps in this document to install the package from the new location.

### RHEL and variants (CentOS, Fedora, Oracle Linux and Amazon Linux 2)

- Install `yum-utils` if it isn't installed yet:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install yum-utils
    ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Your distribution and version, and identify the closest entry (by major, then minor) for it under `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/`.

    Use the following table to help guide you in locating the package:

    |Distro & version|Package|
    |---|---|
    |For RHEL/Centos/Oracle 8.0-8.5|<https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/prod.repo>|
    |For RHEL/Centos/Oracle 7.2-7.9 & Amazon Linux 2 |<https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7.2/prod.repo>|
    |For Fedora 33|<https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/33/prod.repo>|
    |For Fedora 34|<https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/34/prod.repo>|

    <!--|For RHEL/Centos 6.7-6.10|<https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/6/[channel].repo>|-->

    In the following commands, replace *[version]* and *[channel]* with the information you've identified:

    ```bash
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/[version]/[channel].repo
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > Use hostnamectl command to identify system related information including release *[version]*.

    For example, if you are running CentOS 7 and want to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux from the *prod* channel:

    ```bash
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo
    ```

    Or if you wish to explore new features on selected devices, you might want to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux to *insiders-fast* channel:

    ```bash
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/insiders-fast.repo
    ```

- Install the Microsoft GPG public key:

    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import http://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
    ```

### SLES and variants

> [!NOTE]
> Your distribution and version, and identify the closest entry (by major, then minor) for it under `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/sles/`.

   In the following commands, replace *[distro]* and *[version]* with the information you've identified:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper addrepo -c -f -n microsoft-[channel] https://packages.microsoft.com/config/[distro]/[version]/[channel].repo
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Use SPident command to identify system related information including release *[version]*.

   For example, if you are running SLES 12 and wish to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux from the *prod* channel:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper addrepo -c -f -n microsoft-prod https://packages.microsoft.com/config/sles/12/prod.repo
   ```

- Install the Microsoft GPG public key:

    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import http://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
    ```

### Ubuntu and Debian systems

- Install `curl` if it isn't installed yet:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

- Install `libplist-utils` if it isn't installed yet:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libplist-utils
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Your distribution and version, and identify the closest entry (by major, then minor) for it under `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/[distro]/`.

   In the below command, replace *[distro]* and *[version]* with the information you've identified:

   ```bash
    curl -o microsoft.list https://packages.microsoft.com/config/[distro]/[version]/[channel].list
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Use hostnamectl command to identify system related information including release *[version]*.

   For example, if you are running Ubuntu 18.04 and wish to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux from the *prod* channel:

   ```bash
   curl -o microsoft.list https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list
   ```

- Install the repository configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ./microsoft.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-[channel].list
    ```

    For example, if you chose *prod* channel:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ./microsoft.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
    ```

- Install the `gpg` package if not already installed:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gpg
    ```

  If `gpg` is not available, then install `gnupg`.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gnupg
    ```

- Install the Microsoft GPG public key:

    ```bash
	curl -sSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
    ```

- Install the HTTPS driver if not already installed:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

- Update the repository metadata:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

## Application installation

- RHEL and variants (CentOS and Oracle Linux):

    ```bash
    sudo yum install mdatp
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have multiple Microsoft repositories configured on your device, you can be specific about which repository to install the package from. The following example shows how to install the package from the `production` channel if you also have the `insiders-fast` repository channel configured on this device. This situation can happen if you are using multiple Microsoft products on your device. Depending on the distribution and the version of your server, the repository alias might be different than the one in the following example.

    ```bash
    # list all repositories
    yum repolist
    ```

    ```Output
    ...
    packages-microsoft-com-prod               packages-microsoft-com-prod        316
    packages-microsoft-com-prod-insiders-fast packages-microsoft-com-prod-ins      2
    ...
    ```

    ```bash
    # install the package from the production repository
    sudo yum --enablerepo=packages-microsoft-com-prod install mdatp
    ```

- SLES and variants:

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install mdatp
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have multiple Microsoft repositories configured on your device, you can be specific about which repository to install the package from. The following example shows how to install the package from the `production` channel if you also have the `insiders-fast` repository channel configured on this device. This situation can happen if you are using multiple Microsoft products on your device.

    ```bash
    zypper repos
    ```

    ```Output
    ...
    #  | Alias | Name | ...
    XX | packages-microsoft-com-insiders-fast | microsoft-insiders-fast | ...
    XX | packages-microsoft-com-prod | microsoft-prod | ...
    ...

    ```

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install packages-microsoft-com-prod:mdatp
    ```

- Ubuntu and Debian system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install mdatp
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have multiple Microsoft repositories configured on your device, you can be specific about which repository to install the package from. The following example shows how to install the package from the `production` channel if you also have the `insiders-fast` repository channel configured on this device. This situation can happen if you are using multiple Microsoft products on your device.

    ```bash
    cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
    ```

    ```Output
    deb [arch=arm64,armhf,amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod insiders-fast main
    deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod bionic main
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo apt -t bionic install mdatp
    ```

## Download the onboarding package

Download the onboarding package from Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you miss this step, any command executed will show a warning message indicating that the product is unlicensed. Also the `mdatp health` command returns a value of `false`.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Settings > Endpoints > Device management > Onboarding**.
2. In the first drop-down menu, select **Linux Server** as the operating system. In the second drop-down menu, select **Local Script** as the deployment method.
3. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip.

   :::image type="content" source="images/portal-onboarding-linux.png" alt-text="Downloading an onboarding package in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="images/portal-onboarding-linux.png":::

4. From a command prompt, verify that you have the file, and extract the contents of the archive:

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

    ```Output
    total 8
    -rw-r--r-- 1 test  staff  5752 Feb 18 11:22 WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    ```

    ```Output
    Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    inflating: MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
    ```

## Client configuration

1. Copy MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py to the target device.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Initially the client device is not associated with an organization and the *orgId* attribute is blank.

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

2. Run MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To run this command, you must have `python`  or `python3` installed on the device depending on the disto and version. If needed, see [Step-by-step Instruction for Installing Python on Linux](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/install-python-linux).

    If you're running RHEL 8.x or Ubuntu 20.04 or higher, you will need to use `python3`.

    ```bash
    sudo python3 MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
    ```

    For the rest of distros and versions, you will need to use `python`.

    ```bash
    sudo python MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
    ```

3. Verify that the device is now associated with your organization and reports a valid organization identifier:

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

4. Check the health status of the product by running the following command. A return value of `1` denotes that the product is functioning as expected:

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field healthy
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When the product starts for the first time, it downloads the latest antimalware definitions. This may take up to a few minutes depending on the network connectivity. During this time the above command returns a value of `false`. You can check the status of the definition update using the following command:
    >
    > ```bash
    > mdatp health --field definitions_status
    > ```
    >
    > Please note that you may also need to configure a proxy after completing the initial installation. See [Configure Defender for Endpoint on Linux for static proxy discovery: Post-installation configuration](linux-static-proxy-configuration.md#post-installation-configuration).

5. Run an AV detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

    - Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of `1` from running the following command):

        ```bash
        mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
        ```

      If it is not enabled, execute the following command:

       ```bash
        mdatp config real-time-protection --value enabled
        ```

    - Open a Terminal window and execute the following command:

        ``` bash
        curl -o /tmp/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt
        ```

    - The file should have been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Linux. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

        ```bash
        mdatp threat list
        ```

6. Run an EDR detection test and simulate a detection to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

    - Verify that the onboarded Linux server appears in Microsoft 365 Defender. If this is the first onboarding of the machine, it can take up to 20 minutes until it appears.

    - Download and extract the [script file](https://aka.ms/LinuxDIY) to an onboarded Linux server and run the following command: `./mde_linux_edr_diy.sh`

    - After a few minutes, a detection should be raised in Microsoft 365 Defender.

    - Look at the alert details, machine timeline, and perform your typical investigation steps.

## Installer script

Alternatively, you can use an automated [installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) provided in our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/).
The script identifies the distribution and version, simplifies the selection of the right repository, sets up the device to pull the latest package, and combines the product installation and onboarding steps.

```bash
> ./mde_installer.sh --help
usage: basename ./mde_installer.sh [OPTIONS]
Options:
-c|--channel      specify the channel from which you want to install. Default: insiders-fast
-i|--install      install the product
-r|--remove       remove the product
-u|--upgrade      upgrade the existing product
-o|--onboard      onboard/offboard the product with <onboarding_script>
-p|--passive-mode set EPP to passive mode
-t|--tag          set a tag by declaring <name> and <value>. ex: -t GROUP Coders
-m|--min_req      enforce minimum requirements
-w|--clean        remove repo from package manager for a specific channel
-v|--version      print out script version
-h|--help         display help
```
