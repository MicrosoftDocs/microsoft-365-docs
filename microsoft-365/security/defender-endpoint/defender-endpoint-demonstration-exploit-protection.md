# Exploit protection (EP) demonstrations

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

Exploit Protection automatically applies exploit mitigation settings system wide and on individual apps. Many of the features in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) have been included in Exploit Protection, and you can convert and import existing EMET configuration profiles into Exploit Protection.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 10 1709 build 16273
- Run PowerShell commands:

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath ProcessMitigation.xml
```

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation –help
```

- Verify configuration

```powershell

Get-ProcessMitigation
```

### Sample xml file

[EP xml config file](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com/Content/ProcessMitigation.xml?) (right select, "save target as")

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Convert EMET xml to Exploit Protection settings

1. Convert EMET to xml, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
ConvertTo-ProcessMitigationPolicy
```

2. Apply settings, run PowerShell command:  *use the XML from the prior step*

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath
```

3. Confirm settings were applied, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-ProcessMitigation
```

4. Review the event log for application compatibility

### Scenario 2: Apply selfhost xml to Exploit Protection settings

1. Download our EP xml config file (right select, "save target as") or use your own
2. Apply settings, run PowerShell command:
