#  Run the client analyzer on Windows

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2146631)


1.  Download the [MDE Client Analyzer tool](https://aka.ms/mdatpanalyzer) to the
    Windows machine you need to investigate.

2.  Extract the contents of MDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine.

3.  Open an elevated command line:
    1. Go to **Start** and type **cmd**.
    2. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

4.  Enter the following command and press **Enter**:

```
HardDrivePath\MDEClientAnalyzer.cmd
```

**Replace HardDrivePath with the path to which the tool was extracted to, for example:**

`C:\Work\tools\MDATPClientAnalyzer\MDEClientAnalyzer.cmd`

In addition to the above, there is also an option to [collect the analyzer
support logs using live
response.](troubleshoot-collect-support-log.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> On windows 10, Windows Server 2019 or later OS editions, the client analyzer script calls into an executable file called `MDEClientAnalyzer.exe` to run the connectivity tests to cloud service URLs. <br> <br> 
> On Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016 or previous OS editions, the client analyzer script calls into an executable file called `MDEClientAnalyzerPreviousVersion.exe` to run connectivity tests for Command and Control (CnC) URLs while also calling into Microsoft Monitoring Agent connectivity tool `TestCloudConnection.exe` for Cyber Data channel URLs.

## Result package contents on Windows

> [!NOTE]    
> The exact files captured may change depending on factors such as:
> -   The version of windows on which the analyzer is run.
> -   Event log channel availability on the machine.
> -   The start state of the EDR sensor (Sense is stopped if machine is not yet
    onboarded).
>-   If an advanced troubleshooting parameter was used with the analyzer command.
