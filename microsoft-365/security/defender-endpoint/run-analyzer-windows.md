# Run the client analyzer on Windows

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

1. Download the [MDE Client Analyzer tool](https://aka.ms/mdatpanalyzer) to the Windows machine you need to investigate.

2. Extract the contents of MDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine.

3. Open an elevated command line:
    1. Go to **Start** and type **cmd**.
    2. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

4. Enter the following command and press **Enter**:

   ```dos
   HardDrivePath\MDEClientAnalyzer.cmd
   ```

   **Replace HardDrivePath with the path to which the tool was extracted to, for example:**

   ```dos
   C:\Work\tools\MDEClientAnalyzer\MDEClientAnalyzer.cmd
   ```

In addition to the above, there is also an option to [collect the analyzer support logs using live response.](troubleshoot-collect-support-log.md).

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2019/2022, or Windows Server 2012R2/2016 with the [modern unified solution](configure-server-endpoints.md#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution) installed, the client analyzer script calls into an executable file called `MDEClientAnalyzer.exe` to run the connectivity tests to cloud service URLs.
>
> On Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016 or any previous OS edition where Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is used for onboarding, the client analyzer script calls into an executable file called `MDEClientAnalyzerPreviousVersion.exe` to run connectivity tests for Command and Control (CnC) URLs while also calling into Microsoft Monitoring Agent connectivity tool `TestCloudConnection.exe` for Cyber Data channel URLs.


All the PowerShell scripts and modules included with the analyzer are Microsoft-signed.
If files have been modified in any way, then the analyzer is expected to exit with the following error:

:::image type="content" source="images/sigerror.png" alt-text="The client analyzer error" lightbox="images/sigerror.png":::


If this error is shown, then the issuerInfo.txt output will contain detailed information about why that happened and what file was affected:

:::image type="content" source="images/issuerinfo.png" alt-text="The issuer info" lightbox="images/issuerinfo.png":::


Example contents after MDEClientAnalyzer.ps1 is modified:

:::image type="content" source="images/modified-ps1.png" alt-text="The  modified ps1 file" lightbox="images/modified-ps1.png":::



## Result package contents on Windows

> [!NOTE]
> The exact files captured may change depending on factors such as:
>
> - The version of windows on which the analyzer is run.
> - Event log channel availability on the machine.
> - The start state of the EDR sensor (Sense is stopped if machine is not yet onboarded).
> - If an advanced troubleshooting parameter was used with the analyzer command.
