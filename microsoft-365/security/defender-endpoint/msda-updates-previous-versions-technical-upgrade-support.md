- Beginning with platform version 4.18.2208.0 and later: If a server has been onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, the "Turn off Windows Defender" [group policy setting](configure-endpoints-gp.md#update-endpoint-protection-configuration) will no longer completely disable Windows Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2012 R2 and later operating systems. Instead, it is either ignored (if [ForceDefenderPassiveMode](switch-to-mde-phase-2.md#set-microsoft-defender-antivirus-to-passive-mode-on-windows-server) is configured explicitly) or it places Microsoft Defender Antivirus into [passive mode](microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows.md#comparing-active-mode-passive-mode-and-disabled-mode) (if `ForceDefenderPassiveMode` isn't configured). Moreover, [tamper protection](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md) allows a switch to active mode via changing `ForceDefenderPassiveMode` to `0`, but not to passive mode. These changes apply only to servers onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. For more information, please refer to [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility with other security products](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility#microsoft-defender-antivirus-and-non-microsoft-antivirusantimalware-solutions)
