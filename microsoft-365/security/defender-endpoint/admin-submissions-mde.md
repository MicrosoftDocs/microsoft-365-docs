In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, admins can use the unified submissions feature to submit files and file hashes (SHAs) to Microsoft for review. The unified submissions experience is a one-stop shop for submitting emails, URLs, email attachments, and files in one, easy-to-use submission experience. Admins can use the Microsoft Defender portal or the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Alert page to submit suspicious files.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

The new unified submissions experience is available only in subscriptions that include Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2.
You need to assign permissions before you can perform the procedures in this article. Use one of the following options:

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** permissions:
 - Submit files / file hashes: _"Alerts investigation" or "Manage security settings in Security Center"_
 - View submissions: "_View Data - Security operations"_
                  
**Microsoft Defender XDR** unified RBAC permissions:
 - Submit files / file hashes: *"Alerts (Manage)" or "Core security settings (manage)"*
 - View submissions: _"Security data basics (read)"_
                        
For more information about how you can submit spam, phish, URLs, and email attachments to Microsoft, see [Use the Submissions page to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, legitimate email getting blocked, and email attachments to Microsoft](../office-365-security/submissions-admin.md).
