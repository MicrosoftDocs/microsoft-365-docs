# Network protection demonstrations

Network Protection helps reduce the attack surface of your devices from Internet-based events. It prevents employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 10 1709 build 16273
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

## PowerShell command

Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled

### States
- Enabled = Block mode (1)
- AuditMode = Audit Mode (2)
- Disabled = Off (0)

## Verify configuration

Get-MpPreference

## Scenario

1. Turn on Network Protection using powershell command: Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
2. Using the browser of your choice (not Microsoft Edge*), navigate to the [Network Protection website test](https://smartscreentestratings2.net/) (Microsoft Edge has other security measures in place to protect from this vulnerability(SmartScreen)). 

## Expected results

Navigation to the website should be blocked and you should see a "Connection blocked" notification.

## Clean-up

Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Disabled
