# Network protection demonstrations

Network Protection helps reduce the attack surface of your devices from Internet-based events. It prevents employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 10 1709 build 16273, Windows 11
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

## PowerShell command

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
```

## Rule states

|State | Mode| Numeric value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Disabled | = Off | 0 |
| Enabled | = Block mode | 1 |
| Audit | = Audit mode | 2 |

## Verify configuration

```powershell
Get-MpPreference
```

## Scenario

1. Turn on Network Protection using powershell command:

   ```powershell
   Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
   ```

2. Using the browser of your choice (not Microsoft Edge*), navigate to the [Network Protection website test](https://smartscreentestratings2.net/). Microsoft Edge has other security measures in place to protect from this vulnerability (SmartScreen).

## Expected results

Navigation to the website should be blocked and you should see a **Connection blocked** notification.

## Clean-up

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Disabled
```
