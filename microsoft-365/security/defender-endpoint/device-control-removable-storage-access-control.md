> [!NOTE]
> None of Windows Security components need to be active as you can run Removable Storage Access Control independent of Windows Security status.

## Device Control Removable Storage Access Control Policies

You can use the following properties to create a removable storage group:

> [!NOTE]
> Comments using XML comment notation `<!-- COMMENT -->` can be used in the Rule and Group XML files, but they must be inside the first XML tag, not the first line of the XML file.

### Removable Storage Group

|Property Name|Description|Options|
|---|---|---|
|**GroupId**|GUID, a unique ID, represents the group and will be used in the policy.||
|**DescriptorIdList**|List the device properties you want to use to cover in the group. For each device property, see [Device Properties](device-control-removable-storage-protection.md) for more detail. All properties are case sensitive. |**PrimaryId**: `RemovableMediaDevices`, `CdRomDevices`, `WpdDevices`<p>**BusId**: For example, USB, SCSI<p>**DeviceId**<p>**HardwareId**<p>**InstancePathId**: InstancePathId is a string that uniquely identifies the device in the system, for example, `USBSTOR\DISK&VEN_GENERIC&PROD_FLASH_DISK&REV_8.07\8735B611&0`. The number at the end (for example &0) represents the available slot and may change from device to device. For best results, use a wildcard at the end. For example, `USBSTOR\DISK&VEN_GENERIC&PROD_FLASH_DISK&REV_8.07\8735B611*`.<p>**FriendlyNameId**<p>**SerialNumberId**<p>**VID**<p>**PID**<p>**VID_PID**<p>`0751_55E0`: match this exact VID/PID pair<p>`_55E0`: match any media with PID=55E0 <p>`0751_`: match any media with VID=0751|
|**MatchType**|When there are multiple device properties being used in the `DescriptorIDList`, MatchType defines the relationship.|**MatchAll**: Any attributes under the `DescriptorIdList` will be **And** relationship; for example, if administrator puts `DeviceID` and `InstancePathID`, for every connected USB, system will check to see whether the USB meets both values. <p> **MatchAny**: The attributes under the DescriptorIdList will be **Or** relationship; for example, if administrator puts `DeviceID` and `InstancePathID`, for every connected USB, system will do the enforcement as long as the USB has either an identical **DeviceID** or **InstanceID** value.|

### Access Control Policy
You can use the following properties to create the access control policy:

| Property Name | Description | Options |
|---|---|---|
| **PolicyRule Id** | GUID, a unique ID, represents the policy and will be used in the reporting and troubleshooting. | |
| **IncludedIdList** | The group(s) that the policy will be applied to. If multiple groups are added, the policy will be applied to any media in all those groups.|The Group ID/GUID must be used at this instance. <p> The following example shows the usage of GroupID: <p> `<IncludedIdList> <GroupId> {EAA4CCE5-F6C9-4760-8BAD-FDCC76A2ACA1}</GroupId> </IncludedIdList>` |
| **ExcludedIDList** | The group(s) that the policy will not be applied to. | The Group ID/GUID must be used at this instance. |
| **Entry Id** | One PolicyRule can have multiple entries; each entry with a unique GUID tells Device Control one restriction.| |
| **Type** | Defines the action for the removable storage groups in IncludedIDList. <p>Enforcement: Allow or Deny <p>Audit: AuditAllowed or AuditDenied<p> | Allow<p>Deny <p>AuditAllowed: Defines notification and event when access is allowed <p>AuditDenied: Defines notification and event when access is denied; has to work together with **Deny** entry.<p> When there are conflict types for the same media, the system will apply the first one in the policy. An example of a conflict type is **Allow** and **Deny**. |
| **Sid** | Local user Sid or user Sid group or the Sid of the AD object, defines whether to apply this policy over a specific user or user group; one entry can have a maximum of one Sid and an entry without any Sid means applying the policy over the machine. |  |
| **ComputerSid** | Local computer Sid or computer Sid group or the Sid of the AD object, defines whether to apply this policy over a specific machine or machine group; one entry can have a maximum of one ComputerSid and an entry without any ComputerSid means applying the policy over the machine. If you want to apply an Entry to a specific user and specific machine, add both Sid and ComputerSid into the same Entry. |  |
| **Options** | Defines whether to display notification or not |**When Type Allow is selected**: <p>0: nothing<p>4: disable **AuditAllowed** and **AuditDenied** for this Entry. Even if **Allow** happens and the AuditAllowed is setting configured, the system will not send event. <p>8: capture file information and have a copy of the file as evidence for Write access. <p>16: capture file information for Write access. <p>**When Type Deny is selected**: <p>0: nothing<p>4: disable **AuditDenied** for this Entry. Even if **Block** happens and the AuditDenied is setting configured, the system will not show notification. <p>**When Type **AuditAllowed** is selected**: <p>0: nothing <p>1: nothing <p>2: send event<p> **When Type **AuditDenied** is selected**: <p>0: nothing <p>1: show notification <p>2: send event<p>3: show notification and send event |
|AccessMask|Defines the access. | **Disk level access**: <p>1: Read <p>2: Write <p>4: Execute <p>**File system level access**: <p>8: File system Read <p>16: File system Write <p>32: File system Execute <p><p>You can have multiple access by performing binary OR operation, for example, the AccessMask for Read and Write and Execute will be 7; the AccessMask for Read and Write will be 3.|

## Device Control Removable Storage Access Control Scenarios

To help you familiarize with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Removable Storage Access Control, we have put together some common scenarios for you to follow.

### Scenario 1: Prevent Write and Execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs

1. Create groups

    1. Group 1: Any removable storage and CD/DVD. An example of a removable storage and CD/DVD is: Group **9b28fae8-72f7-4267-a1a5-685f747a7146** in the sample [Any Removable Storage and CD-DVD Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    2. Group 2: Approved USBs based on device properties. An example for this use case is:
    Instance ID - Group **65fa649a-a111-4912-9294-fb6337a25038** in the sample [Approved USBs Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    > [!TIP]
    > Replace `&` with `&amp;` in the value.

2. Create policy

    1. Policy 1: Block Write and Execute Access but allow approved USBs. An example for this use case is: PolicyRule **c544a991-5786-4402-949e-a032cb790d0e** in the sample [Scenario 1 Block Write and Execute Access but allow approved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    2. Policy 2: Audit Write and Execute access to allowed USBs. An example for this use case is: PolicyRule **36ae1037-a639-4cff-946b-b36c53089a4c** in the sample [Scenario 1 Audit Write and Execute access to approved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

### Scenario 2: Audit Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs

1. Create groups

    1. Group 1: Any removable storage and CD/DVD. An example for this use case is:
    Group **9b28fae8-72f7-4267-a1a5-685f747a7146** in the sample [Any Removable Storage and CD-DVD Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    2. Group 2: Unapproved USBs based on device properties, for example, Vendor ID / Product ID, Friendly Name - Group **65fa649a-a111-4912-9294-fb6337a25038** in the sample [Unapproved USBs Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    > [!TIP]
    > Replace `&` with `&amp;` in the value.

2. Create policy

    1. Policy 1: Block Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs. An example of this use case is: PolicyRule **23b8e437-66ac-4b32-b3d7-24044637fc98** in the sample [Scenario 2 Audit Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    2. Policy 2: Audit Write and Execute access to others. An example of this use case is: PolicyRule **b58ab853-9a6f-405c-a194-740e69422b48** in the sample [Scenario 2 Audit Write and Execute access to others.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

## Deploying and managing Removable Storage Access Control by using Intune OMA-URI

The Removable Storage Access Control feature enables you to apply policy by using OMA-URI to either user or device, or both.

### Licensing requirements

Before you get started with Removable Storage Access Control, you  must confirm your [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=2). To access and use Removable Storage Access Control, you must have Microsoft 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5.

### Permission

For policy deployment in Intune, the account must have permissions to create, edit, update, or delete device configuration profiles. You can create custom roles or use any of the built-in roles with these permissions.

- Policy and profile Manager role
- Custom role with Create/Edit/Update/Read/Delete/View Reports permissions turned on for Device Configuration profiles
- Global administrator

### Deploying Removable Storage Access Control by using Intune OMA-URI

Go to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center (<https://endpoint.microsoft.com/>) **> Devices > Create profile > Platform: Windows 10 and later, Profile type: Templates > Custom**

1. Enable or Disable Removable Storage Access Control (RSAC):

   You can enable Removable Storage Access Control as follows:

   - Under **Custom > Configuration settings**, click **Add**.
   - In the **Add Row** pane, enter:

10. Set location for a copy of the file (evidence):

    If you want to have a copy of the file (evidence) when Write access happens, you have to set the location where system can save the copy.

    - Go to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus > Device Control > Define Device Control evidence data remote location**.

    - In the **Define Device Control evidence data remote location** window, select **Enabled** and enter the local or network share folder path.

## Frequently asked questions

### How to generate GUID for Group Id/PolicyRule Id/Entry Id?

You can generate GUID through online open source, or through PowerShell - [How to generate GUID through PowerShell](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-guid)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81826151/159046476-26ea0a21-8087-4f01-b8ae-5aa73b392d8f.png)

### What are the removable storage media and policy limitations?

Either from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center (Intune) or through Microsoft Graph API, the backend call is done through OMA-URI (GET to read or PATCH to update) and therefore the limitation is the same as any OMA-URI custom configuration profile in Microsoft which is officially 350,000 characters for XML files.

For example, if you need two blocks of entries per user SID to "Allow"/"Audit allowed" specific users and two blocks of entries at the end to "Deny" all, you will be able to manage 2,276 users.

### Why does the policy not work?

1. The most common reason is there's no required [antimalware client version](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-control-removable-storage-access-control#prepare-your-endpoints).

2. Another reason could be that the XML file isn't correctly formatted, for example, not using the correct markdown formatting for the "&" character in the XML file, or the text editor might add a byte order mark (BOM) 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF at the beginning of the files, which causes the XML parsing not to work. One simple solution is to download the [sample file](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) (select **Raw** and then **Save as**) and then update.

3. If you are deploying and managing the policy by using Group Policy, please make sure to combine all PolicyRule into one XML file within a parent node called PolicyRules and all Group into one XML file within a parent node called Groups; if you manage through Intune, keep one PolicyRule one XML file, same thing, one Group one XML file.

If it still doesn't work, you may want to contact us and share support cab by running cmd with administrator: "%programfiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -GetFiles

### There is no configuration UX for 'Define device control policy groups' and 'Define device control policy rules' on my Group Policy

We don't backport the Group Policy configuration UX, but you can still get the related adml and admx files by clicking 'Raw' and 'Save as' at the [WindowsDefender.adml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/blob/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/WindowsDefender.adml) and [WindowsDefender.admx](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/blob/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/WindowsDefender.admx) files.

### How can I know whether the latest policy has been deployed to the target machine?

You can run "Get-MpComputerStatus' on PowerShell as an Administrator. The following value will show whether the latest policy has been applied to the target machine.

### How can I know which machine is using out of date antimalware client version in the organization?

You can use following query to get antimalware client version on the Microsoft 365 security portal:

```kusto
//check the antimalware client version
DeviceFileEvents
|where FileName == "MsMpEng.exe"
|where FolderPath contains @"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\"
|extend PlatformVersion=tostring(split(FolderPath, "\\", 5))
//|project DeviceName, PlatformVersion // check which machine is using legacy platformVersion
|summarize dcount(DeviceName) by PlatformVersion // check how many machines are using which platformVersion
|order by PlatformVersion desc
```
