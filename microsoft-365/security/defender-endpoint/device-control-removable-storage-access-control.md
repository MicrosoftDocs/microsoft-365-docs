> [!NOTE]
> None of Windows Security components need to be active as you can run Removable Storage Access Control independent of Windows Security status.

## Policy properties

You can use the following properties to create a removable storage group:

#### Removable Storage Group
|Property Name  |Description  |Options  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**GroupId**     |   [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), a unique ID, represents the group and will be used in the policy.      |         |
|**DescriptorIdList**     |  List the device properties you want to use to cover in the group. For each device property, see [Device Properties](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-control-removable-storage-protection?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) for more detail.​       |  - **PrimaryId**​: RemovableMediaDevices, CdRomDevices, WpdDevices</br> - **DeviceId​** </br>- **HardwareId​**</br>- **InstancePathId**​: InstancePathId is a string that uniquely identifies the device in the system, for example, USBSTOR\DISK&VEN_GENERIC&PROD_FLASH_DISK&REV_8.07\8735B611&0. The number at the end (for example &0) represents the available slot and may change from device to device. For best results, use a wildcard at the end. For example, USBSTOR\DISK&VEN_GENERIC&PROD_FLASH_DISK&REV_8.07\8735B611*</br>- **FriendlyNameId​**</br>- **SerialNumberId​**</br>- **VID​**</br>- **PID​**</br>- **VID_PID**</br> 0751_55E0: match this exact VID/PID pair </br>_55E0: match any media with PID=55E0 </br>0751_: match any media with VID=0751 |
|**MatchType**     |    When there are multiple device properties being used in the DescriptorIDList, MatchType defines the relationship.     |  **MatchAll**: </br>​Any attributes under the DescriptorIdList will be **And** relationship; for example, if administrator puts DeviceID and InstancePathID, for every connected USB, system will check to see whether the USB meets both values.​ </br> </br>**MatchAny**:</br> ​The attributes under the DescriptorIdList will be **Or** relationship; for example, if administrator puts DeviceID and InstancePathID, for every connected USB, system will do the enforcement as long as the USB has either an identical **DeviceID** or **InstanceID** value.​       |
||||


#### Access Control Policy

|Property Name  |Description  |Options  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|PolicyRuleId​     |     [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), a unique ID, represents the policy and will be used in the reporting and troubleshooting.    |         |
|IncludedIdList     | The group(s) that the policy will be applied to. If multiple groups are added, the policy will be applied to any media in all those groups.        |    The Group ID/GUID must be used at this instance.​ </br> ​The following example shows the usage of GroupID:​ </br> `<IncludedIdList> <GroupId> {EAA4CCE5-F6C9-4760-8BAD-FDCC76A2ACA1}</GroupId> </IncludedIdList>​`    |
|ExcludedIDList     | The group(s) that the policy will not be applied to.        |    The Group ID/GUID must be used at this instance.     |
|Entry Id     |  One PolicyRule can have multiple entries; each entry with a unique GUID tells Device Control one restriction.​       |         |
|Type|Defines the action for the removable storage groups in IncludedIDList.​ </br>- Enforcement: Allow or Deny​ </br>- Audit: AuditAllowed or AuditDenied​|- Allow​ </br>- Deny​</br> - AuditAllowed: Defines notification and event when access is allowed​</br>- AuditDenied: Defines notification and event when access is denied; has to work together with **Deny** entry.​ </br></br> When there are conflict types for the same media, the system will apply the first one in the policy. An example of a conflict type is **Allow** and **Deny**.​|
|Sid|Local computer Sid or the Sid of the AD object, defines whether to apply this policy over a specific user or user group; one entry can have a maximum of one Sid and an entry without any Sid means applying the policy over the machine.​||
|ComputerSid|Local computer Sid or the Sid of the AD object, defines whether to apply this policy over a specific machine or machine group; one entry can have a maximum of one ComputerSid and an entry without any ComputerSid means applying the policy over the machine. If you want to apply an Entry to a specific user and specific machine, add both Sid and ComputerSid into the same Entry.​||
|Options|Defines whether to display notification or not​|0-4. When Type Allow or Deny is selected:</br>​</br>0: nothing​</br>4: disable **AuditAllowed** and **AuditDenied** for this Entry. Even if **Block** happens and the AuditDenied is setting configured, the system will not show notification.​ </br> </br>When Type **AuditAllowed** or **AuditDenied** is selected:​</br>0: nothing​</br>1: show notification​</br>2: send event​</br>3: show notification and send event​|
|AccessMask|Defines the access.​|1-7:​ </br></br>1: Read​</br>2: Write​</br>3: Read and Write​</br>4: Execute​</br>5: Read and Execute​</br>6: Write and Execute​</br>7: Read and Write and Execute​|

## Common Removable Storage Access Control scenarios

To help familiarize you with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Removable Storage Access Control, we have put together some common scenarios for you to follow.

### Scenario 1: Prevent Write and Execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs

1. Create groups
    1. Group 1: Any removable storage and CD/DVD. An example of a removable storage and CD/DVD is: Group **9b28fae8-72f7-4267-a1a5-685f747a7146** in the sample [Any Removable Storage and CD-DVD Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.
    2. Group 2: Approved USBs based on device properties. An example for this use case is:
    Instance ID - Group **65fa649a-a111-4912-9294-fb6337a25038** in the sample [Approved USBs Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You have to replace `&` with `&amp;` in the value.

2. Create policy
    1. Policy 1: Block Write and Execute Access but allow approved USBs. An example for this use case is: PolicyRule **c544a991-5786-4402-949e-a032cb790d0e** in the sample [Scenario 1 Block Write and Execute Access but allow approved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.
    2. Policy 2: Audit Write and Execute access to allowed USBs. An example for this use case is: PolicyRule **36ae1037-a639-4cff-946b-b36c53089a4c** in the sample [Scenario 1 Audit Write and Execute access to approved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

### Scenario 2: Audit Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs

1. Create groups
    1. Group 1: Any removable storage and CD/DVD. An example for this use case is:
    Group **9b28fae8-72f7-4267-a1a5-685f747a7146** in the sample [Any Removable Storage and CD-DVD Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.
    2. Group 2: Unapproved USBs based on device properties, for example, Vendor ID / Product ID, Friendly Name - Group **65fa649a-a111-4912-9294-fb6337a25038** in the sample [Unapproved USBs Group.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You have to replace `&` with `&amp;` in the value.

2. Create policy
    1. Policy 1: Block Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs. An example of this use case is: PolicyRule **23b8e437-66ac-4b32-b3d7-24044637fc98** in the sample [Scenario 2 Audit Write and Execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

    2. Policy 2: Audit Write and Execute access to others. An example of this use case is: PolicyRule **b58ab853-9a6f-405c-a194-740e69422b48** in the sample [Scenario 2 Audit Write and Execute access to others.xml](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) file.

## Deploying and managing policy via Group Policy

The Removable Storage Access Control feature enables you to apply policy via Group Policy to either user or device, or both.

### Licensing

Before you get started with Removable Storage Access Control, you must confirm your [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=2). To access and use Removable Storage Access Control, you must have Microsoft 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5.

### Deploying policy via Group Policy

1. Combine all groups within `<Groups>` `</Groups>` into one xml file.

    The following image illustrates the example of [Scenario 1: Prevent Write and Execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs](#scenario-1-prevent-write-and-execute-access-to-all-but-allow-specific-approved-usbs).

    :::image type="content" source="images/prevent-write-access-allow-usb.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the configuration settings that allow specific approved USBs on devices":::

2. Combine all rules within `<PolicyRules>` `</PolicyRules>` into one xml file.

    If you want to restrict a specific user, then use SID property into the Entry. If there's no SID in the policy Entry, the Entry will be applied to everyone login instance for the machine.

    The following image illustrates the usage of SID property, and an example of [Scenario 1: Prevent Write and Execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs](#scenario-1-prevent-write-and-execute-access-to-all-but-allow-specific-approved-usbs).

    :::image type="content" source="images/usage-sid-property.png" alt-text="The screen displaying a code that indicates usage of the SID property attribute":::

3. Save both rule and group XML files on network share folder and put network share folder path into the Group Policy setting: **Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Microsoft Defender Antivirus -> Device Control: 'Define device control policy groups' and 'Define device control policy rules'**.

    - The target machine must be able to access the network share to have the policy. However, once the policy is read, the network share connection is no longer required, even after machine reboot.

    :::image type="content" source="images/device-control.png" alt-text="The Device Control screen":::

## Deploying and managing policy via Intune OMA-URI

The Removable Storage Access Control feature enables you to apply policy via OMA-URI to either user or device, or both.

### Licensing requirements

Before you get started with Removable Storage Access Control, you  must confirm your [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=2). To access and use Removable Storage Access Control, you must have Microsoft 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5.

### Permission

For policy deployment in Intune, the account must have permissions to create, edit, update, or delete device configuration profiles. You can create custom roles or use any of the built-in roles with these permissions.

- Policy and profile Manager role
- Custom role with Create/Edit/Update/Read/Delete/View Reports permissions turned on for Device Configuration profiles
- Global administrator

### Deploying policy via OMA-URI

**Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center (https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) -> Devices -> Configuration profiles -> Create profile -> Platform: Windows 10 and later & Profile: Custom**

1. For each Group, create an OMA-URI rule:
    - OMA-URI:

      ./Vendor/MSFT/Defender/Configuration/DeviceControl/PolicyGroups/%7b**GroupGUID**%7d/GroupData

      For example, for **any removable storage and CD/DVD** group in the sample, the link must be:

      ./Vendor/MSFT/Defender/Configuration/DeviceControl/PolicyGroups/%7b9b28fae8-72f7-4267-a1a5-685f747a7146%7d/GroupData

    - Data Type: String (XML file)

2. For each policy, also create an OMA-URI:

    - OMA-URI:

      ./Vendor/MSFT/Defender/Configuration/DeviceControl/PolicyRules/%7bFA6BE102-0784-4A2A-B010-A0BEBEBF68E1%7d/RuleData

      For example, for the **Block Write and Execute Access but allow approved USBs** rule in the sample, the link must be:

      ./Vendor/MSFT/Defender/Configuration/DeviceControl/PolicyRules/%7bc544a991-5786-4402-949e-a032cb790d0e%7d/RuleData.

    - Data Type: String (XML file)

## Deploying and managing policy by using Intune user interface

This capability (in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center (<https://endpoint.microsoft.com/>) \> Devices \> Configuration profiles \> Create profile \> Platform: Windows 10 and later & Profile: Device Control) isn't yet available.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the removable storage media limitation for the maximum number of USBs?

We've validated one USB group with 100,000 media - up to 7 MB in size. The policy works in both Intune and GPO without performance issues.

### Why does the policy not work?

The most common reason is there's no required [antimalware client version](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-control-removable-storage-access-control#prepare-your-endpoints).

Another reason could be that the XML file isn't correctly formatted, for example, not using the correct markdown formatting for the "&" character in the XML file, or the text editor might add a byte order mark (BOM) 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF at the beginning of the files, which causes the XML parsing not to work. One simple solution is to download the [sample file](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples) (select **Raw** and then **Save as**) and then update.

If there's a value and the policy is managed via Group Policy, check whether the client device can access the policy XML path.

### How can I know which machine is using out of date antimalware client version in the organization?

You can use following query to get antimalware client version on the Microsoft 365 security portal:

```kusto
//check the antimalware client version
DeviceFileEvents
|where FileName == "MsMpEng.exe"
|where FolderPath contains @"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\"
|extend PlatformVersion=tostring(split(FolderPath, "\\", 5))
//|project DeviceName, PlatformVersion // check which machine is using legacy platformVersion
|summarize dcount(DeviceName) by PlatformVersion // check how many machines are using which platformVersion
|order by PlatformVersion desc
```
