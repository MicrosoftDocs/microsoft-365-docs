# Export certificate inventory per device

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](../defender-vulnerability-management/index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management? Learn more about how you can sign up to the [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management public preview trial](../defender-vulnerability-management/get-defender-vulnerability-management.md).

There are different API calls to get different types of data. In general, each API call contains the requisite data for devices in your organization.

- **JSON response**  The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for _small organizations with less than 100-K devices_. The response is paginated, so you can use the \@odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.

- **via files** This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. You can download data from Azure Storage as follows:
  - Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.
  - Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.

Data that is collected using either '_JSON response_ or _via files_' is the current snapshot of the current state. It doesn't contain historic data. To collect historic data, customers must save the data in their own data storages.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless indicated otherwise, all export security baseline assessment methods listed are **_full export_** and **_by device_** (also referred to as **_per device_**)

## 1. Export certificate assessment (JSON response)

### 1.1 API method description

Returns all certificate assessments for all devices, on a per-device basis. It returns a table with a separate entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, Thumbprint and Path.

#### 1.1.1 Limitations

- Maximum page size is 200,000.
- Rate limitations for this API are 30 calls per minute and 1000 calls per hour.

### 1.2 Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs for details.](apis-intro.md)

Permission type|Permission|Permission display name
:---|:---|:---
Application|Software.Read.All|'Read Threat and Vulnerability Management software information'
Delegated (work or school account)|Software.Read|'Read Threat and Vulnerability Management software information'

### 1.3 URL

```http
GET /api/machines/certificateAssessmentByMachine
```

### 1.4 Parameters

- pageSize (default = 50,000): Number of results in response.
- $top: Number of results to return (doesn't return @odata.nextLink and so doesn't pull all the data).


### 1.5 Properties (JSON response)

> [!NOTE]
> Each record is approximately 1 KB of data. You should take this into account when choosing the correct pageSize parameter.
>
> Some additional columns might be returned in the response. These columns are temporary and might be removed. Only use the documented columns.
>
> The properties defined in the following table are listed alphabetically by property ID. When running this API, the resulting output will not necessarily be returned in the same order listed in this table.

Property (ID)|Data type|Description
:---|:---|:---
|DeviceId|String|Unique identifier for the device in the service.
|DeviceName|String|Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the device.
|Thumbprint|Boolean|Unique identifier for the certificate.
|Path|String|The location of the certificate.
|SignatureAlgorithm|String|Hashing algorithm and encryption algorithm used.
|KeySize|String|Size of the key used in the signature algorithm.
|ExpirationDate|String|The date and time beyond which the certificate is no longer valid.
|IssueDate|String|The earliest date and time when the certificate became valid.
|SubjectType|String|Indicates if the holder of the certificate is a CA or end entity.
|SerialNumber|String|Unique identifier for the certificate within a certificate authority's systems.
|IssuedTo|Object|Entity that a certificate belongs to; can be a device, an individual, or an organization.
|IssuedBy|Object|Entity that verified the information and signed the certificate.
|KeyUsage|String|The valid cryptographic uses of the certificate's public key.
|ExtendedKeyUsage|String|Other valid uses for the certificate.
|RbacGroupId|String|The role-based access control (RBAC) group id.
|RbacGroupName|String|The role-based access control (RBAC) group. If this device isn't assigned to any RBAC groups, the value will be "Unassigned." If the organization doesn't contain any RBAC groups, the value will be "None."
