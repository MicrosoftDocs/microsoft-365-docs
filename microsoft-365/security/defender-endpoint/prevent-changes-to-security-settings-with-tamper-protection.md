# Protect security settings with tamper protection

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

**Platforms**
- Windows

Tamper protection is available for devices that are running one of the following versions of Windows:

- Windows 11
- Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session 
- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server, version 1803 or later
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2

> [!NOTE]
> Tamper protection in Windows Server 2012 R2 is available for devices onboarded using the modern unified solution package. For more information, see [Onboard Windows servers to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints).

## Overview

During some kinds of cyber attacks, bad actors try to disable security features, such as antivirus protection, on your machines. Bad actors like to disable your security features to get easier access to your data, to install malware, or to otherwise exploit your data, identity, and devices. Tamper protection helps prevent these kinds of things from occurring. With tamper protection, malicious apps are prevented from taking actions such as:

- Disabling virus and threat protection
- Disabling real-time protection
- Turning off behavior monitoring
- Disabling antivirus protection, such as IOfficeAntivirus (IOAV)
- Disabling cloud-delivered protection
- Removing security intelligence updates
- Disabling automatic actions on detected threats
- Suppressing notifications in the Windows Security app
- Disabling scanning of archives and network files

### How it works

Tamper protection essentially locks Microsoft Defender Antivirus to its secure, default values, and prevents your security settings from being changed through apps and methods such as:

- Configuring settings in Registry Editor on your Windows device
- Changing settings through PowerShell cmdlets
- Editing or removing security settings through Group Policy

Tamper protection doesn't prevent you from viewing your security settings. And, tamper protection doesn't affect how non-Microsoft antivirus apps register with the Windows Security app. If your organization is using Windows 10 Enterprise E5, individual users can't change the tamper protection setting; in those cases, tamper protection is managed by your security team.

## Potential dependency on cloud protection  
  
Depending on the method or management tool you use to enable tamper protection, there might be a dependency on [cloud-delivered protection](cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) Cloud-delivered protection is also referred to as cloud protection, or Microsoft Advanced Protection Service (MAPS).

The following table provides details on the methods, tools, and dependencies.

| How tamper protection is enabled | Dependency on cloud protection |
|---|---|
|Microsoft Intune|No|
|Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager with Tenant Attach|No|
|Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com))|Yes|

## Manage tamper protection for your organization using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Tamper protection can be turned on or off for your tenant using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). Here are a few points to keep in mind:

- Currently, the option to manage tamper protection in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal is on by default for new deployments. For existing deployments, tamper protection is available on an opt-in basis. To opt in, in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, choose **Settings** \> **Endpoints** \> **Advanced features** \> **Tamper protection**.
- When you use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage tamper protection, you do not have to use Intune or the tenant attach method.
- When you manage tamper protection in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, the setting is applied tenant wide, affecting all of your devices that are running Windows 10, Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Windows 11, Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. To fine-tune tamper protection (such as having tamper protection on for some devices but off for others), use either [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](#manage-tamper-protection-for-your-organization-using-microsoft-endpoint-manager) or [Configuration Manager with tenant attach](#manage-tamper-protection-for-your-organization-with-configuration-manager-version-2006).
- If you have a hybrid environment, tamper protection settings configured in Intune take precedence over settings configured in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

### Requirements for managing tamper protection in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

- You must have appropriate [permissions](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/assign-portal-access) assigned, such as global admin, security admin, or security operations.

- Your Windows devices must be running one of the following versions of Windows:
  
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session 
  - Windows 10
  - Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session
  - Windows Server 2022
  - Windows Server 2019
  - Windows Server, version 1803 or later
  - Windows Server 2016
  - Windows Server 2012 R2

For more information about releases, see [Windows 10 release information](/windows/release-health/release-information).

- Your devices must be [onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/onboarding).
- Your devices must be using anti-malware platform version `4.18.2010.7` (or above) and anti-malware engine version `1.1.17600.5` (or above). ([Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).)
- [Cloud-delivered protection](enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) must be turned on.

> [!NOTE]
> When tamper protection is enabled via the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, cloud-delivered protection is required, so that the enabled state of tamper protection can be controlled.  
> Starting with the November 2021 update (platform version `4.18.2111.5`), if cloud-delivered protection is not turned on for a device and tamper protection is turned on in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, then cloud-delivered protection will be automatically turned on for that device along with tamper protection.   

### Turn tamper protection on (or off) in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mde-turn-tamperprotectionon.png" alt-text="Turn tamper protection turned on in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mde-turn-tamperprotectionon.png":::

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. Choose **Settings** \> **Endpoints**.

3. Go to **General** \> **Advanced features**, and then turn tamper protection on.

## Manage tamper protection for your organization using Microsoft Endpoint Manager

If your organization uses Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) you can turn tamper protection on (or off) for your organization in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)). Use Intune when you want to fine-tune tamper protection settings. For example, if you want to enable tamper protection on some devices, but not all, use Intune.

### Requirements for managing tamper protection in Endpoint Manager

- You must have appropriate [permissions](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/assign-portal-access) assigned, such as global admin, security admin, or security operations.
- Your organization uses [Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage devices](/mem/endpoint-manager-getting-started). (Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) licenses are required; MEM is included in Microsoft 365 E3/E5, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3/E5, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Microsoft 365 F1/F3, Microsoft 365 Government G3/G5, and corresponding education licenses.)
- Your Windows devices must be running Windows 11 or Windows 10 [1709](/lifecycle/announcements/revised-end-of-service-windows-10-1709), [1803](/lifecycle/announcements/windows-server-1803-end-of-servicing), [1809](/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-1809-and-windows-server-2019), or later. (For more information about releases, see [Windows 10 release information](/windows/release-health/release-information).)
- You must be using Windows security with [security intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/definitions) updated to version 1.287.60.0 (or above).
- Your devices must be using anti-malware platform version 4.18.1906.3 (or above) and anti-malware engine version `1.1.15500.X` (or above). ([Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).)

### Turn tamper protection on (or off) in Microsoft Endpoint Manager

:::image type="content" source="images/turnontamperprotectinmem.png" alt-text="Turn tamper protection turned on with Intune" lightbox="images/turnontamperprotectinmem.png":::

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** \> **Antivirus**, and then choose **+ Create Policy**.

   - In the **Platform** list, select **Windows 10 and later**.
   - In the **Profile** list, select **Windows Security experience**.

2. Create a profile that includes the following setting:

    - **Enable tamper protection to prevent Microsoft Defender being disabled: Enable**

3. Assign the profile to one or more groups.
 
### Manage tamper protection for your organization with Configuration Manager, version 2006

If you're using [version 2006 of Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2006), you can manage tamper protection settings on Windows 10, Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Windows 11, Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022 by using a method called *tenant attach*. Tenant attach enables you to sync your on-premises-only Configuration Manager devices into the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, and then deliver endpoint security configuration policies to on-premises collections & devices.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedure can be used to extend tamper protection to devices running Windows 10, Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Windows 11, Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022. Make sure to review the prerequisites and other information in the resources mentioned in this procedure. For Windows Server 2012 R2 running the modern, unified solution [version 2203 of Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2203) is required.

1. Set up tenant attach. To learn more, see [Get started: Create and deploy endpoint security policies from the admin center](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/endpoint-security-get-started).

2. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** \> **Antivirus**, and then choose **+ Create Policy**.

   - In the **Platform** list, select **Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server (ConfigMgr)**.
   - In the **Profile** list, select **Windows Security experience (preview)**.

3. Deploy the policy to your device collection.

## Manage tamper protection on an individual device

> [!NOTE]
> Tamper protection blocks attempts to modify Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings through the registry.
> To help ensure that tamper protection doesn't interfere with non-Microsoft security products or enterprise installation scripts that modify these settings, go to **Windows Security** and update **Security intelligence** to version 1.287.60.0 or later. (See [Security intelligence updates](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/definitions).)
> After you've made this update, tamper protection continues to protect your registry settings, and logs attempts to modify them without returning errors.

If you are a home user, or you are not subject to settings managed by a security team, you can use the Windows Security app to manage tamper protection. You must have appropriate admin permissions on your device to do change security settings, such as tamper protection.

Here's what you see in the Windows Security app:

:::image type="content" source="images/tamperprotectionturnedon.png" alt-text="Turn tamper protection turned on in Windows 10 Home" lightbox="images/tamperprotectionturnedon.png":::

1. Select **Start**, and start typing *Security*. In the search results, select **Windows Security**.

2. Select **Virus & threat protection** \> **Virus & threat protection settings**.

3. Set **Tamper Protection** to **On** or **Off**.

## Are you using Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, or Windows version 1709, 1803, or 1809?

If you are using Windows Server 2012 R2 using the modern unified solution, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 version 1709, 1803, or [1809](/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-1809-and-windows-server-2019), you won't see **Tamper Protection** in the Windows Security app. Instead, you can use PowerShell to determine whether tamper protection is enabled.

On Windows Server 2016, the Settings app will not accurately reflect the status of real-time protection when tamper protection is enabled.

#### Use PowerShell to determine whether tamper protection and real-time protection are turned on

1. Open the Windows PowerShell app.

2. Use the [Get-MpComputerStatus](/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?preserve-view=true&view=win10-ps) PowerShell cmdlet.

3. In the list of results, look for `IsTamperProtected` or `RealTimeProtectionEnabled`. (A value of *true* means tamper protection is enabled.)

## View information about tampering attempts

Tampering attempts typically indicate bigger cyberattacks. Bad actors try to change security settings as a way to persist and stay undetected. If you're part of your organization's security team, you can view information about such attempts, and then take appropriate actions to mitigate threats.

When a tampering attempt is detected, an alert is raised in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/portal-overview) ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)).

Using [endpoint detection and response](overview-endpoint-detection-response.md) and [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, your security operations team can investigate and address such attempts.

## Review your security recommendations

Tamper protection integrates with [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.md) capabilities. [Security recommendations](tvm-security-recommendation.md) include making sure tamper protection is turned on. For example, you can search on *tamper*. In the results, you can select **Turn on Tamper Protection** to learn more and turn it on.

To learn more about Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, see [Dashboard insights - Defender Vulnerability Management](tvm-dashboard-insights.md#dashboard-insights---threat-and-vulnerability-management).

## Frequently asked questions

### On which versions of Windows can I configure tamper protection?

- Windows 11
- Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session
- Windows 10 OS [1709](/lifecycle/announcements/revised-end-of-service-windows-10-1709), [1803](/lifecycle/announcements/windows-server-1803-end-of-servicing), [1809](/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-1809-and-windows-server-2019), or later together with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint).
- Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session
  
If you are using Configuration Manager, version 2006, with tenant attach, tamper protection can be extended to Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022. See [Tenant attach: Create and deploy endpoint security Antivirus policy from the admin center (preview)](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/deploy-antivirus-policy).

### Will tamper protection affect non-Microsoft antivirus registration in the Windows Security app?

No. Non-Microsoft antivirus offerings will continue to register with the Windows Security application.

### What happens if Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not active on a device?

Devices that are onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will have Microsoft Defender Antivirus running in passive mode. In these cases, tamper protection will continue to protect the service and its features.

### How do I turn tamper protection on or off?

If you are a home user, see [Manage tamper protection on an individual device](#manage-tamper-protection-on-an-individual-device).

If you are an organization using [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint), you should be able to manage tamper protection in Intune similar to how you manage other endpoint protection features. See the following sections of this article:

- [Manage tamper protection using Microsoft Endpoint Manager](#manage-tamper-protection-for-your-organization-using-microsoft-endpoint-manager)
- [Manage tamper protection using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](#manage-tamper-protection-for-your-organization-using-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal)

### How does configuring tamper protection in Intune affect how I manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus with Group Policy?

If you are currently using Intune to configure and manage tamper protection, you should continue using Intune. 

Group policy doesn't apply to tamper protection. Changes made to Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings using Group Policy are ignored when tamper protection is turned on, or when tamper protection is configured with Intune.

### If we use Microsoft Intune to configure tamper protection, does it apply only to the entire organization?

You have flexibility in configuring tamper protection with Intune. You can target your entire organization, or select specific devices and user groups.

### Can I configure tamper protection with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager?

If you are using tenant attach, you can use Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. See the following resources:

- [Manage tamper protection for your organization with Configuration Manager, version 2006](#manage-tamper-protection-for-your-organization-with-configuration-manager-version-2006)
- [Tech Community blog: Announcing Tamper Protection for Configuration Manager Tenant Attach clients](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-endpoint-manager-blog/announcing-tamper-protection-for-configuration-manager-tenant/ba-p/1700246#.X3QLR5Ziqq8.linkedin)

### I have the Windows E3 enrollment. Can I use configuring tamper protection in Intune?

Currently, configuring tamper protection in Intune is only available for customers who have [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint).

### I'm an enterprise customer. Can local admins change tamper protection on their devices?

No. Local admins cannot change or modify tamper protection settings.

### What happens if my device is onboarded with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and then goes into an off-boarded state?

If a device is off-boarded from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, tamper protection is turned on, which is the default state for unmanaged devices.

### If the status of tamper protection changes, are alerts shown in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal?

Yes. The alert is shown in [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) under **Alerts**.

Your security operations team can also use hunting queries, such as the following example:

`AlertInfo|where Title == "Tamper Protection bypass"`
