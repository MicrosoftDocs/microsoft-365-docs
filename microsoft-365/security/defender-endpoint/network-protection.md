# Protect your network

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

## Overview of network protection

Network protection helps protect devices from Internet-based events. Network protection is an attack surface reduction capability. It helps prevent employees from accessing dangerous domains through applications. Domains that host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet are considered dangerous. Network protection expands the scope of [Microsoft Defender SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview) to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname).

Network protection extends the protection in [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) to the operating system level. It provides web protection functionality in Edge to other supported browsers and non-browser applications. In addition, network protection provides visibility and blocking of indicators of compromise (IOCs) when used with [Endpoint detection and response](overview-endpoint-detection-response.md). For example, network protection works with your [custom indicators](manage-indicators.md) that you can use to block specific domains or hostnames.

> [!TIP]
> See the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint testground site at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to see how network protection works.

## Requirements for network protection

Network protection requires Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time protection.

<br>

****

|Windows version|Microsoft Defender Antivirus|
|---|---|
|Windows 10 version 1709 or later <p> Windows Server 1803 or later|[Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time protection](configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) and [cloud-delivered protection](enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) must be enabled|
|

After you have enabled the services, you might need to configure your network or firewall to allow the connections between the services and your devices (also referred to as endpoints).

## Configuring network protection

For more information about how to enable network protection, see **[Enable network protection](enable-network-protection.md)**. Use Group Policy, PowerShell, or MDM CSPs to enable and manage network protection in your network.

## Viewing network protection events

Network protection works best with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md), which gives you detailed reporting into exploit protection events and blocks as part of [alert investigation scenarios](investigate-alerts.md).

When network protection blocks a connection, a notification is displayed from the Action Center. Your security operations team can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your organization's details and contact information. In addition, individual attack surface reduction rules can be enabled and customized to suit certain techniques to monitor.

You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md) to evaluate how network protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.

## Review network protection events in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides detailed reporting into events and blocks as part of its [alert investigation scenarios](investigate-alerts.md). You can view these details in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) in the [alerts queue](review-alerts.md) or by using [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md). If you're using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md), you can use advanced hunting to see how network protection settings would affect your environment if they were enabled.

Here is an example query for advanced hunting:

```kusto
DeviceEvents
|where ActionType in ('ExploitGuardNetworkProtectionAudited','ExploitGuardNetworkProtectionBlocked')
```

## Review network protection events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when network protection blocks (or audits) access to a malicious IP or domain:

1. [Copy the XML directly](event-views.md).

2. Select **OK**.

This procedure creates a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to network protection:

<br>

****

|Event ID|Description|
|---|---|
|5007|Event when settings are changed|
|1125|Event when network protection fires in audit mode|
|1126|Event when network protection fires in block mode|
|

## Network protection and the TCP three-way handshake

With network protection, the determination of whether to allow or block access to a site is made after the completion of the [three-way handshake via TCP/IP](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/three-way-handshake-via-tcpip). Thus, when a site is blocked by network protection, you might see an action type of `ConnectionSuccess` under `NetworkConnectionEvents` in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, even though the site was actually blocked. `NetworkConnectionEvents` are reported from the TCP layer, and not from network protection. After the three-way handshake has completed, access to the site is allowed or blocked by network protection.

Here's an example of how that works:

1. Suppose that a user attempts to access a website on his/her device. The site happens to be hosted on a dangerous domain, and it should be blocked by network protection.  

2. The three-way handshake via TCP/IP commences. Before it completes, a `NetworkConnectionEvents` action is logged, and its `ActionType` is listed as `ConnectionSuccess`. However, as soon as the three-way handshake process completes, network protection blocks access to the site. All of this happens very quickly. A similar process occurs with [Microsoft Defender SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview); it's when the three-way handshake completes that a determination is made, and access to a site is either blocked or allowed.

3. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, an alert is listed in the [alerts queue](alerts-queue.md). Details of that alert include both `NetworkConnectionEvents` and `AlertEvents`. You can see that the site was blocked, even though you also have a `NetworkConnectionEvents` item with the ActionType of `ConnectionSuccess`.

## Considerations for Windows virtual desktop running Windows 10 Enterprise Multi-Session

Due to the multi-user nature of Windows 10 Enterprise, keep the following points in mind:

1. Network protection is a device-wide feature and cannot be targeted to specific user sessions.

2. Web content filtering policies are also device wide.

3. If you need to differentiate between user groups, consider creating separate Windows Virtual Desktop host pools and assignments.

4. Test network protection in audit mode to assess its behavior before rolling out.

5. Consider resizing your deployment if you have a large number of users or a large number of multi-user sessions.

### Alternative option for network protection

For Windows 10 Enterprise Multi-Session 1909 and up, used in Windows Virtual Desktop on Azure, network protection for Microsoft Edge can be enabled using the following method:

1. Use [Turn on network protection](enable-network-protection.md) and follow the instructions to apply your policy.

2. Execute the following PowerShell command: `Set-MpPreference -AllowNetworkProtectionOnWinServer 1`

## Network protection troubleshooting

Due to the environment where network protection runs, Microsoft might not be able to detect operating system proxy settings. In some cases, network protection clients are unable to reach Cloud Service. To resolve the connectivity problem, customers with E5 licenses should configure one of the following Defender registry keys:

```console
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v ProxyServer /d "<proxy IP address: Port>" /f
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v ProxyPacUrl /d "<Proxy PAC url>" /f

```
