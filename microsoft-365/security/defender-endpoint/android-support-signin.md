## Report unsafe site

Phishing websites impersonate trustworthy websites for the purpose of obtaining your personal or financial information. Visit the [Provide feedback about network protection](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission/exploitguard/networkprotection) page if you want to report a website that could be a phishing site.

## Phishing pages aren't blocked on some OEM devices

**Applies to:** Specific OEMs only

- **Xiaomi**

Phishing and harmful web threats that are detected by Defender for Endpoint
for Android are not blocked on some Xiaomi devices. The following functionality doesn't work on these devices.

![Image of site reported unsafe.](images/0c04975c74746a5cdb085e1d9386e713.png)

**Cause:**

Xiaomi devices include a new permission model. This prevents Defender for Endpoint for Android from displaying pop-up windows while it runs in the background.

Xiaomi devices permission: "Display pop-up windows while running in the
background."

![Image of pop up setting.](images/6e48e7b29daf50afddcc6c8c7d59fd64.png)

**Solution:**

Enable the required permission on Xiaomi devices.

- Display pop-up windows while running in the background.

## Unable to allow permission for 'Permanent protection' during onboarding on some OEM devices

**Applies to:** Specific OEM devices only.

- **Xiaomi with Android 11**

Defender App asks for Battery Optimization/Permanent Protection permission on devices as part of app onboarding, and selecting **Allow** returns an error that the permission couldn't be set. It only affects the last permission called "Permanent Protection." 

**Cause:**

Xiaomi changed the battery optimization permissions in Android 11. Defender for Endpoint is not allowed to configure this setting to ignore battery optimizations.

**Solution:**

We are working with OEM to find a solution to enable this permission from the app onboarding screen. We will update the documentation when this is resolved.
Users can follow these steps to enable the same permissions from the device settings: 

1. Go to **Settings** on your device.

2. Search for and select **Battery Optimization**.

3. In **Special app access**, select **Battery Optimization**.

4. Change the Dropdown to show **All Apps**.

5. Locate “Microsoft Defender for Endpoint” and select **Don’t Optimize**.

Return to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding screen, select **Allow**, and you will be redirected to the dashboard screen.
