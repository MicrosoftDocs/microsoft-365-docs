You can use Group Policy Objects in Azure Active Directory Domain Services to manage some settings in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Configure your Microsoft 365 Defender portal

If you haven't already done so, configure your Microsoft 365 Defender portal to view alerts, configure threat protection features, and view detailed information about your organization's overall security posture. See [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender). You can also configure whether and what features end users can see in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
