You might need to troubleshoot the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding process if you encounter issues.
This page provides detailed steps to troubleshoot onboarding issues that might occur when deploying with one of the deployment tools and common errors that might occur on the devices.

Before you start troubleshooting issues with onboarding tools, it's important to check if the minimum requirements are met for onboarding devices to the services. [Learn about the licensing, hardware, and software requirements to onboard devices to the service](minimum-requirements.md).

## Troubleshoot issues with onboarding tools

If you've completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the [Devices list](investigate-machines.md) after an hour, it might indicate an onboarding or connectivity problem.

### Troubleshoot onboarding when deploying with Group Policy

Deployment with Group Policy is done by running the onboarding script on the devices. The Group Policy console doesn't indicate if the deployment has succeeded or not.

If you've completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the [Devices list](investigate-machines.md) after an hour, you can check the output of the script on the devices. For more information, see [Troubleshoot onboarding when deploying with a script](#troubleshoot-onboarding-when-deploying-with-a-script).

If the script completes successfully, see [Troubleshoot onboarding issues on the devices](#troubleshoot-onboarding-issues-on-the-device) for additional errors that might occur.

### Troubleshoot onboarding issues when deploying with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager

When onboarding devices using the following versions of Configuration Manager:

- Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
- System Center 2012 Configuration Manager
- System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager

Deployment with the above-mentioned versions of Configuration Manager is done by running the onboarding script on the devices. You can track the deployment in the Configuration Manager Console.

If the deployment fails, you can check the output of the script on the devices.

If the onboarding completed successfully but the devices aren't showing up in the **Devices list** after an hour, see [Troubleshoot onboarding issues on the device](#troubleshoot-onboarding-issues-on-the-device) for additional errors that might occur.

### Troubleshoot onboarding when deploying with a script

**Check the result of the script on the device:**

1. Click **Start**, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2. Go to **Windows Logs** \> **Application**.

3. Look for an event from **WDATPOnboarding** event source.

If the script fails and the event is an error, you can check the event ID in the following table to help you troubleshoot the issue.

> [!NOTE]
> The following event IDs are specific to the onboarding script only.

<br>

****

|Event ID|Error Type|Resolution steps|
|:---:|---|---|
|`5`|Offboarding data was found but couldn't be deleted|Check the permissions on the registry, specifically <p> `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.|
|`10`|Onboarding data couldn't be written to registry|Check the permissions on the registry, specifically <p> `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`. <p> Verify that the script has been run as an administrator.|

|

### Troubleshoot onboarding issues using Microsoft Intune

You can use Microsoft Intune to check error codes and attempt to troubleshoot the cause of the issue.

If you have configured policies in Intune and they aren't propagated on devices, you might need to configure automatic MDM enrollment.

Use the following tables to understand the possible causes of issues while onboarding:

- Microsoft Intune error codes and OMA-URIs table
- Known issues with non-compliance table
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) event logs table

If none of the event logs and troubleshooting steps work, download the Local script from the **Device management** section of the portal, and run it in an elevated command prompt.

There are additional components on the device that the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent depends on to function properly. If there are no onboarding related errors in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent event log, proceed with the following steps to ensure that the additional components are configured correctly.

<span id="ensure-the-diagnostics-service-is-enabled" />

### Ensure the diagnostic data service is enabled

If the devices aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows diagnostic data service is set to automatically start and is running on the device. The service might have been disabled by other programs or user configuration changes.

First, you should check that the service is set to start automatically when Windows starts, then you should check that the service is currently running (and start it if it isn't).

### Ensure the service is set to start

**Use the command line to check the Windows diagnostic data service startup type**:

1. Open an elevated command-line prompt on the device:

   a. Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

   b. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2. Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

   ```console
   sc qc diagtrack
   ```

   If the service is enabled, then the result should look like the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="images/windefatp-sc-qc-diagtrack.png" alt-text="The result of the sc query command for diagtrack" lightbox="images/windefatp-sc-qc-diagtrack.png":::

   If the `START_TYPE` isn't set to `AUTO_START`, then you need to set the service to automatically start.

**Use the command line to set the Windows diagnostic data service to automatically start:**

1. Open an elevated command-line prompt on the device:

   a. Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

   b. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2. Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

   ```console
   sc config diagtrack start=auto
   ```

3. A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command, and press **Enter**:

   ```console
   sc qc diagtrack
   ```

4. Start the service. In the command prompt, type the following command and press **Enter**:

   ```console
   sc start diagtrack
   ```

### Ensure the device has an Internet connection

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint sensor requires Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) to report sensor data and communicate with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service.

WinHTTP is independent of the Internet browsing proxy settings and other user context applications and must be able to detect the proxy servers that are available in your particular environment.

To ensure that sensor has service connectivity, follow the steps described in the [Verify client connectivity to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service URLs](configure-proxy-internet.md#verify-client-connectivity-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls) topic.

If the verification fails and your environment is using a proxy to connect to the Internet, then follow the steps described in [Configure proxy and Internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy-internet.md) topic.

### Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following only applies to devices that have **not** yet received the August 2020 (version 4.18.2007.8) update to Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
>
> The update ensures that Microsoft Defender Antivirus cannot be turned off on client devices via system policy.

**Problem**: The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service doesn't start after onboarding.

**Symptom**: Onboarding successfully completes, but you see error 577 or error 1058 when trying to start the service.

**Solution**: If your devices are running a third-party antimalware client, the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent needs the Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver to be enabled. You must ensure that it's not turned off by a system policy.

- Depending on the tool that you use to implement policies, you need to verify that the following Windows Defender policies are cleared:

  - DisableAntiSpyware
  - DisableAntiVirus

  For example, in Group Policy there should be no entries such as the following values:

  - `<Key Path="SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"><KeyValue Value="0" ValueKind="DWord" Name="DisableAntiSpyware"/></Key>`
  - `<Key Path="SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"><KeyValue Value="0" ValueKind="DWord" Name="DisableAntiVirus"/></Key>`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `disableAntiSpyware` setting is discontinued and will be ignored on all Windows 10 devices, as of the August 2020 (version 4.18.2007.8) update to Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

- After clearing the policy, run the onboarding steps again.

- You can also check the previous registry key values to verify that the policy is disabled, by opening the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender`.

  :::image type="content" source="images/atp-disableantispyware-regkey.png" alt-text="The registry key for Microsoft Defender Antivirus" lightbox="images/atp-disableantispyware-regkey.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > All Windows Defender services (wdboot, wdfilter, wdnisdrv, wdnissvc, and windefend) should be in their default state. Changing the startup of these services is unsupported and may force you to reimage your system.
   >
   > Example default configurations for WdBoot and WdFilter:
   >
   > - `<Key Path="SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WdBoot"><KeyValue Value="0" ValueKind="DWord" Name="Start"/></Key>`
   > - `<Key Path="SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WdFilter"><KeyValue Value="0" ValueKind="DWord" Name="Start"/></Key>`

## Troubleshoot onboarding issues 

> [!NOTE]
> The following troubleshooting guidance is only applicable for Windows Server 2016 and lower.

If you encounter issues while onboarding a server, go through the following verification steps to address possible issues.


- [Ensure Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is installed and configured to report sensor data to the service](configure-server-endpoints.md)
- [Ensure that the server proxy and Internet connectivity settings are configured properly](configure-server-endpoints.md)

You might also need to check the following:

- Check that there's a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Service running in the **Processes** tab in **Task Manager**. For example:

  :::image type="content" source="images/atp-task-manager.png" alt-text="The process view with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Service running" lightbox="images/atp-task-manager.png":::

- Check **Event Viewer** \> **Applications and Services Logs** \> **Operation Manager** to see if there are any errors.

- In **Services**, check if the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** is running on the server. For example,

  :::image type="content" source="images/atp-services.png" alt-text="The services" lightbox="images/atp-services.png":::

- In **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** \> **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**, check the Workspaces and verify that the status is running.

  :::image type="content" source="images/atp-mma-properties.png" alt-text="The Microsoft Monitoring Agent Properties" lightbox="images/atp-mma-properties.png":::

- Check to see that devices are reflected in the **Devices list** in the portal.

## Confirming onboarding of newly built devices

There may be instances when onboarding is deployed on a newly built device but not completed.

The steps below provide guidance for the following scenario:

- Onboarding package is deployed to newly built devices
- Sensor doesn't start because the Out-of-box experience (OOBE) or first user logon hasn't been completed
- Device is turned off or restarted before the end user performs a first logon
- In this scenario, the SENSE service won't start automatically even though onboarding package was deployed

> [!NOTE]
> User Logon after OOBE is no longer required for SENSE service to start on the following or more recent Windows versions: 
> Windows 10, version 1809 or Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022 with [April 22 2021 update rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5001384). 
> Windows 10, version 1909 with [April 2021 update rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5001396). 
> Windows 10, version 2004/20H2 with [April 28 2021 update rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5001391).
