## Setting up the pilot environment 

This section describes the process for setting up the pilot UAT / Test / QA environment.

On about 10-500* Windows and/or Windows Server systems, depending on how many total systems that you all have:

In the Intune portal [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), create or append to your Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy the following setting:
For example, your pilot policy named _MDAV_Settings_Pilot_. If you have a Citrix environment, include at least one Citrix VM (non-persistent and/or  persistent).

> [!NOTE]
> Security intelligence update (SIU) is equivalent to signature updates, which is the same as definition updates.

Recommended settings are as follows:

|Feature  | Recommendation |
|:--- |:--- |
| Engine Updates Channel | Beta Channel |
| Platform Updates Channel | Beta Channel |
| Security Intelligence Updates Channel | Current Channel (Staged) |

## Setting up the Production environment 

In the Intune portal [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), create or append to your Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy using the following setting:
For example, your production policy named _MDAV_Settings_Production_.

:::image type="content" source="images/microsoft-defender-antivirus-deploy-ring-intune-microsoft-defender-antivirus-production-policy-settings.png" alt-text="Shows recommended Intune Microsoft Defender Antivirus production policy settings." lightbox="images/microsoft-defender-antivirus-deploy-ring-intune-microsoft-defender-antivirus-production-policy-settings.png":::

|Feature  | Recommendation | Comments |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Engine Updates Channel | Critical – Time delay | It's delayed by two days.|
| Platform Updates Channel | Critical – Time delay | It's delayed by two days.|
| Security Intelligence Updates Channel | Current Channel (Broad) | This configuration provides you with 3 hours of time to find an FP and prevent the production systems from getting an incompatible signature update. |

### If you encounter problems

If you encounter problems with your deployment, change the source of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates:

1. In the Intune portal [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), go to **Endpoint Security**, select **Antivirus**, and then find your Intune production policy (for example, MDAV_Settings_Production), and then, in **Configuration settings**, select **Edit**.

1. Change the entry to **FileShares**. This change is shown in the following figure.

#### What this change does

It forces Microsoft Defender Antivirus to look for the **Security Intelligence Update**, **Engine Update** or **Platform Update** from a file share that doesn't exist.

#### How long does it take for the Intune policy to refresh?

If you update a policy, it's within a few minutes (3-5 minutes) via WNS, as long the WNS URLs' are open.

Reference:   [Intune actions that immediately send a notification to a device](/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot#intune-actions-that-immediately-send-a-notification-to-a-device)

After the issue is resolved, set the "Signature Update Fallback Order" back to the original setting"
