[Attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](./attack-surface-reduction.md) identify and prevent typical malware exploits. They control when and how potentially malicious code can run. For example, they can prevent JavaScript or VBScript from launching a downloaded executable, block Win32 API calls from Office macros, and block processes that run from USB drives.

*Attack surface management card*

The *Attack surface management card* is an entry point to tools in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> that you can use to:

* Understand how ASR rules are currently deployed in your organization.
* Review ASR detections and identify possible incorrect detections.
* Analyze the impact of exclusions and generate the list of file paths to exclude.

Select **Go to attack surface management** \> **Reports** \> **Attack surface reduction rules** \> **Add exclusions**. From there, you can navigate to other sections of Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
