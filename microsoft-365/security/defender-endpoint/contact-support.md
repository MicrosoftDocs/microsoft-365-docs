Defender for Endpoint has recently upgraded the support process to offer a more modern and advanced support experience.

The new widget allows customers to:

- Find solutions to common problems
- Submit a support case to the Microsoft support team

## Prerequisites

It's important to know the specific roles that have permission to open support cases.

At a minimum, you must have a Service Support Administrator **OR** Helpdesk Administrator role.

For more information on which roles have permission see, [Security Administrator permissions](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator). Roles that include the action `microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks` can submit a case.

For general information on admin roles, see [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

## Access the widget

Accessing the new support widget can be done in one of two ways:

1. Clicking on the question mark on the top right of the portal and then clicking on "Microsoft support":

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/contactsupport.png" alt-text="Microsoft support.":::

2. Clicking on the **Need help?**  button in the bottom right of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:

In the widget you will be offered two options:

- Find solutions to common problems
