Defender for Endpoint has recently upgraded the support process to offer a more modern and advanced support experience. 

The new widget allows customers to:
- Find solutions to common problems
- Submit a support case to the Microsoft support team

## Prerequisites
It's important to know the specific roles that have permission to open support cases.

At a minimum, you must have a Service Support Administrator **OR** Helpdesk Administrator role.


For more information on which roles have permission see, [Security Administrator permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#security-administrator-permissions). Roles that include the action `microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks` can submit a case.

For general information on admin roles, see [About admin roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).


## Access the widget
Accessing the new support widget can be done in one of two ways:

1.  Clicking on the question mark on the top right of the portal and then clicking on "Microsoft support":

2. Clicking on the **Need help?**  button in the bottom right of the Microsoft Defender Security Center:

In the widget you will be offered two options:

- Find solutions to common problems    
- Open a service request  

## Find solutions to common problems
This option includes articles that might be related to the question you may ask. Just start typing the question in the search box and articles related to your search will be surfaced.
