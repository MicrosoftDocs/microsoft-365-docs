## EICAR test file to simulate malware

Run an AV detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

### Windows

1. Prepare for the EICAR test file:

   1. Use an EICAR test file instead of real malware to avoid causing damage. Microsoft Defender Antivirus treats EICAR test files as malware.

1. Create the EICAR test file:

   1. Copy the following string: `X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`

      1. Paste the string into a .TXT file and save it as EICAR.txt

### Linux/macOS

1. Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of 1 from running the following command):

```bash
mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
```

1. Open a Terminal window. Copy and execute the following command:

  
Linux


```bash
curl -o ~/tmp/eicar.com.txt https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
```

macOS


```bash
curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
```

3. The file has been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Mac. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

```bash
mdatp threat list
```
