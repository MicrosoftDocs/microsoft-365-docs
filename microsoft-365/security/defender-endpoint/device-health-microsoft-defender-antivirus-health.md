## Microsoft Defender Antivirus health tab

The Microsoft Defender Antivirus health tab contains eight cards that report on several aspects of Microsoft Defender Antivirus in your organization:

Two cards, [Antivirus mode card](#antivirus-mode-card) and [Recent antivirus scan results card](#recent-antivirus-scan-results-card), report about Microsoft Defender Antivirus functions.

The remaining six cards report about the Microsoft Defender Antivirus status for devices in your organization:

| _version_ cards: | _update_ cards{<a id="fn1">1</a>} |
|:---|:---|
| [Antivirus engine version card](#antivirus-engine-version-card) <br> [Antivirus security intelligence version card](#antivirus-security-intelligence-version-card) <br> [Antivirus platform version card](#antivirus-platform-version-card) | [Antivirus engine updates card](#antivirus-engine-updates-card) <br> [Security intelligence updates card](#security-intelligence-updates-card) <br> [Antivirus platform updates card](#antivirus-platform-updates-card) |
| The three version cards provide flyout reports that provide additional information, and enable further exploration. | The three up-to-date reporting cards provide links to resources to learn more. |

<sup>{[1](#fn1)}</sup> For the three _updates_ cards (also known as up-to-date reporting cards), "**No data available**" (or "Unknown" value) indicates devices that aren't reporting update status. Devices that aren't reporting update status can be due to various reasons, such as:

- Computer is disconnected from the network.
- Computer is powered down or in a hibernation state.
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus is disabled.
- Device is a non-Windows (Mac or Linux) device.
- Cloud protection isn't enabled.
- Device doesn't meet pre-requisites for Antivirus engine or platform version.

### Microsoft Defender Antivirus version and update cards functionality

Following are descriptions for the six cards that report about the _version_ and _update_ information for Microsoft Defender Antivirus engine, security intelligence, and platform components:

#### Full report

In any of the three _version_ cards, select **View full report** to display the nine most recent Microsoft Defender Antivirus _version_ reports for each of the three device types: Windows, Mac, and Linux; if fewer than nine exist, they're all shown. An **Other** category captures recent antivirus engine versions ranking tenth and below, if detected.

:::image type="content" source="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-view-full-report.png" alt-text="Shows the distribution of the top nine operating systems of each type" lightbox="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-view-full-report.png":::

A primary benefit of the three _version_ cards is that they provide quick indicators as to whether the most current versions of the antivirus engines, platforms, and security intelligence are being utilized. Coupled with the detailed information that is linked to the card, the versions cards become a powerful tool to check if versions are up to date and to gather information about individual computers, or groups of computers.
Ideally, when you run these reports, they'll indicate that the most current antivirus versions are installed, as opposed to older versions.
Use these reports to determine whether your organization is taking full advantage of the most current versions.

:::image type="content" source="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-antivirus-details-up-to-date.png" alt-text="Shows Microsoft Defender Antivirus version details" lightbox="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-antivirus-details-up-to-date.png":::

To help ensure your anti-malware solution detects the latest threats, get updates automatically as part of Windows Update.

### Card descriptions

Following are brief summaries of the collected information reported in each of the _Antivirus version_ cards:

#### Antivirus mode card

Reports on how many devices in your organization – on the date indicated on the card – are in any of the following Microsoft Defender Antivirus modes:

| value | mode |
|---|---|
| 0 | Active |
| 1 | Passive |
| 2 | Disabled (uninstalled, disabled, or SideBySidePassive {also known as Low Periodic Scan}) |
| 3 | Others (Not running, Unknown) |
| 4 | EDRBlocked |

:::image type="content" source="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-antivirus-mode.png" alt-text="Shows filtering Microsoft Defender Antivirus modes" lightbox="images/device-health-defender-antivirus-health-antivirus-mode.png":::

Following are descriptions for each mode:

- **Active** mode - In active mode, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is used as the primary antivirus app on the device. Files are scanned, threats are remediated, and detected threats are listed in your organization's security reports and in your Windows Security app.
- **Passive** mode - In passive mode, Microsoft Defender Antivirus isn't used as the primary antivirus app on the device. Files are scanned, and detected threats are reported, but threats aren't remediated by Microsoft Defender Antivirus. IMPORTANT: Microsoft Defender Antivirus can run in passive mode only on endpoints that are onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. See [Requirements for Microsoft Defender Antivirus to run in passive mode](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md#requirements-for-microsoft-defender-antivirus-to-run-in-passive-mode).
- **Disabled** mode - synonymous with: uninstalled, disabled, sideBySidePassive, and Low Periodic Scan. When disabled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus isn't used. Files aren't scanned, and threats aren't remediated. In general, Microsoft doesn't recommend disabling or uninstalling Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- **Others** mode - Not running, Unknown
- **EDR in Block** mode - In endpoint detection and response (EDR) blocked mode. See [Endpoint detection and response in block mode](edr-in-block-mode.md)

Devices that are in either passive, LPS, or Off present a potential security risk and should be investigated.

For details about LPS, see [Use limited periodic scanning in Microsoft Defender Antivirus](limited-periodic-scanning-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

#### Recent antivirus scan results card

This card has two bars graphs showing all-up results for quick scans and full scans. In both graphs, the first bar indicates the completion rate for scans, and indicate **Completed**, **Canceled**, or **Failed**. The second bar in each section provides the error codes for failed scans.
By scanning the **Mode** and **Recent scan results** columns, you can quickly identify devices that aren't in active antivirus scan mode, and devices that have failed or canceled recent antivirus scans. You can return to the report with this information and gather more details and security recommendations. If any error codes are reported in this card, there will be a link to learn more about error codes.

For more details on the current Microsoft Defender Antivirus versions and how to update the different Microsoft Defender Antivirus components, visit [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md).

#### Antivirus engine version card

Shows the real-time results of the most current Microsoft Defender Antivirus engine versions installed across Windows Devices, Mac devices, and Linux devices in your organization. Microsoft Defender Antivirus engine is updated monthly.
For more information on the current versions and how to update the different Microsoft Defender Antivirus components, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform support](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md).

#### Antivirus security intelligence version card

Lists the most common _Microsoft Defender Antivirus security intelligence_ versions installed on devices on your network.
Microsoft continually updates Microsoft Defender security intelligence to address the latest threats, and to refine detection logic. These refinements to security intelligence enhance Microsoft Defender Antivirus' (and other Microsoft anti-malware solutions') ability to accurately identify potential threats. This security intelligence works directly with cloud-based protection to deliver AI-enhanced, next-generation protection that is fast and powerful.

##### Antivirus platform version card

Shows the real-time results of the most current Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform versions installed across versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux devices in your organization. Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform is updated monthly.
For more information on the current versions and how to update the different Microsoft Defender Antivirus components, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform support](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md)

#### Up-to-date cards

The up-to-date cards show the up-to-date status for **Antivirus engine**, **Antivirus platform**, and **Security intelligence** update versions. There are three possible states: _Up to date_ ('True'), _out of date_ ('False'), and _no data available_ ('Unknown').

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The logic used to make up-to-date determinations has recently been enhanced and simplified. The new behavior is documented in this section.

Definitions for _Up to date_, _out of date_, and _no data available_ are provided for each card below.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus uses the additional criteria of "Signature refresh time" (the last time device communicated with up to date reports) to make up-to-date reports and determinations for engine, platform, and security intelligence updates.

The up-to-date status is automatically marked as "unknown" or "no data available" if the device hasn't communicated with reports for more than seven days (signature refresh time >7).

For more information about the aforementioned terms, refer back to the section: [New Microsoft Defender Antivirus filter definitions](#new-microsoft-defender-antivirus-filter-definitions)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Up to date reporting **prerequisites**
>
> Up to date reporting generates information for devices that meet the following criteria:
>
> - Engine version: 1.1.19300.2+
> - Platform version: 4.18.2202.1+
> - Cloud protection enabled
> - Windows OS*
>
>*Currently up to date reporting is only available for Windows devices. Cross platform devices such as Mac and Linux are listed under "no data available"
>

##### Up-to-date definitions

Following are up-to-date definitions for engine and platform:

| The engine/platform on the device is considered: | Situation |
|:---|:---|
| **up to date** | If the device communicated with the Defender report event ('Signature refresh time') within last seven days, and the Engine or Platform build version is greater than or equal to (`>=`) the most recent monthly release version. |
| **out-of-date** | If the device communicated with the Defender report event ('Signature refresh time') within last seven days, but Engine or Platform build version is less than (`<`) the most recent monthly release version. |
| **unknown (no data available)** | If the device hasn't communicated with the report event ('Signature refresh time') for more than seven days. |

Following is the definitions for up-to-date security intelligence:

| The security intelligence update is considered: | Situation |
|:---|:---|
|**up to date** | If the security intelligence version on the device was written in the past seven days and the device has communicated with the report event in past seven days. |

For more information, see:

- [Antivirus engine updates card](#antivirus-engine-updates-card)
- [Security intelligence updates card](#security-intelligence-updates-card)
- [Antivirus platform updates card](#antivirus-platform-updates-card)

##### Antivirus engine updates card

This card identifies devices that have antivirus engine versions that are up to date versus out of date.

**The general definition of 'up to date'** - The engine version on the device is the most recent engine release. The engine is _typically_ released monthly, via Windows Update (WU)). There's a three-day grace period given from the day when Windows Update (WU) is released.

The following table lays out the possible values for up to date reports for **Antivirus Engine**. Reported Status is based on the last time reporting event was received (_signature refresh time_). If the device hasn't communicated with reports for more than seven days (signature refresh time >7 days), then the status is automatically marked as 'Unknown' / 'No Data Available'.

| Event's Last Refresh Time (also known as "Signature Refresh Time" in reports) | _Reported Status_: |
|:----|:----|
| < 7 days (new) | whatever client reports (_Up to date <br/> Out of date <br/> Unknown)_ |
| > 7 days (old) | _Unknown_ |

For information about Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus update versions, see [Monthly platform and engine versions](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md#monthly-platform-and-engine-versions).

#### Antivirus platform updates card

This card identifies devices that have Antivirus platform versions that are up to date versus out of date.

**The general definition of 'up to date'** is that the platform version on the device is the most recent platform release. Platform is _typically_ released monthly, via Windows Update (WU). There's a three-day grace period from the day when WU is released.

The following table lays out the possible up to date report values for **Antivirus Platform**. Reported values are based on the last time reporting event was received (signature refresh time). If the device hasn't communicated with reports for more than seven days (signature refresh time >7 days) then the status is automatically marked as 'Unknown'/ 'No Data Available'.

| Event's Last Refresh Time (also known as "Signature Refresh Time" in reports) | _Reported Status_ |
|:----|:----|
| < 7 days (new) | whatever client reports (_Up to date <br/> Out of date <br/> Unknown)_ |
| > 7 days (old) | _Unknown_ |

For information about Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus update versions, see [Monthly platform and engine versions](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md#monthly-platform-and-engine-versions).

##### Security intelligence updates card

This card identifies devices that have security intelligence versions that are up to date versus out of date.

**The general definition of 'up to date'** is that the security intelligence version on the device was written in the past 7 days.

The following table lays out the possible up to date report values for **Security Intelligence** updates. Reported values are based on the last time reporting event was received, and the security intelligence publish time. If the device hasn't communicated with reports for more than seven days (signature refresh time >7 days), then the status is automatically marked as 'Unknown/ No Data Available'. Otherwise, the determination is made based on whether the security intelligence publish time is within seven days.

| Event's Last Refresh Time <br/> (Also known as "Signature Refresh Time" in reports) | Security Intelligence Publish Time | _Reported Status_ |
|:----|:----|:----|
| >7 days (old) | >7 days (old) | _Unknown_ |
| <7 days (new) | >7 days (old) | _Out of date_ |
| >7 days (old) | <7 days (new) | _Unknown_ |
| <7 days (new) | <7 days (new) | Up to date |

> [!TIP]
> **Performance tip** Due to a variety of factors (examples listed below) Microsoft Defender Antivirus, like other antivirus software, can cause performance issues on endpoint devices. In some cases, you might need to tune the performance of Microsoft Defender Antivirus to alleviate those performance issues. Microsoft's **Performance analyzer** is a PowerShell command-line tool that helps determine which files, file paths, processes, and file extensions might be causing performance issues; some examples are:
>
> - Top paths that impact scan time
> - Top files that impact scan time
> - Top processes that impact scan time
> - Top file extensions that impact scan time
> - Combinations – for example:
>   - top files per extension
>   - top paths per extension
>   - top processes per path
>   - top scans per file
>   - top scans per file per process
>
> You can use the information gathered using Performance analyzer to better assess performance issues and apply remediation actions.
