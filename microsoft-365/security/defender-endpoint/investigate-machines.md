# Investigate devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Devices list

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-investigatemachines-abovefoldlink)

Investigate the details of an alert raised on a specific device to identify other behaviors or events that might be related to the alert or the potential scope of the breach.

> [!NOTE]
> As part of the investigation or response process, you can collect an investigation package from a device. Here's how: [Collect investigation package from devices](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/respond-machine-alerts#collect-investigation-package-from-devices).

You can click on affected devices whenever you see them in the portal to open a detailed report about that device. Affected devices are identified in the following areas:

- [Devices list](investigate-machines.md)
- [Alerts queue](alerts-queue.md)
- [Security operations dashboard](security-operations-dashboard.md)
- Any individual alert
- Any individual file details view
- Any IP address or domain details view

When you investigate a specific device, you'll see:

- Device details
- Response actions
- Tabs (overview, alerts, timeline, security recommendations, software inventory, discovered vulnerabilities, missing KBs)
- Cards (active alerts, logged on users, security assessment, device health status)

> [!NOTE]
> Due to product constrains, the device profile does not consider all cyber evidence when determining the 'Last Seen' timeframe (as seen on the device page as well).
> For example, the 'Last seen' value in the Device page may show an older time frame even though more recent alerts or data is available in the machine's timeline.

## Device details

The device details section provides information such as the domain, OS, and health state of the device. If there's an investigation package available on the device, you'll see a link that allows you to download the package.

## Response actions

Response actions run along the top of a specific device page and include:

- Manage tags
- Isolate device
- Restrict app execution
- Run antivirus scan
- Collect investigation package
- Initiate Live Response Session
- Initiate automated investigation
- Consult a threat expert
- Action center

You can take response actions in the Action center, in a specific device page, or in a specific file page.

For more information on how to take action on a device, see [Take response action on a device](respond-machine-alerts.md).

For more information, see [Investigate user entities](investigate-user.md).

## Tabs

The tabs provide relevant security and threat prevention information related to the device. In each tab, you can customize the columns that are shown by selecting **Customize columns** from the bar above the column headers.

### Overview

The **Overview** tab displays the [cards](#cards) for active alerts, logged on users, and security assessment.

:::image type="content" source="images/overview-device.png" alt-text="The Overview tab on the device page" lightbox="images/overview-device.png":::

### Alerts

The **Alerts** tab provides a list of alerts that are associated with the device. This list is a filtered version of the [Alerts queue](alerts-queue.md), and shows a short description of the alert, severity (high, medium, low, informational), status in the queue (new, in progress, resolved), classification (not set, false alert, true alert), investigation state, category of alert, who is addressing the alert, and last activity. You can also filter the alerts.

:::image type="content" source="images/alerts-device.png" alt-text="The tab of the alerts related to the device" lightbox="images/alerts-device.png":::

When the circle icon to the left of an alert is selected, a fly-out appears. From this panel you can manage the alert and view more details such as incident number and related devices. Multiple alerts can be selected at a time.

To see a full page view of an alert including incident graph and process tree, select the title of the alert.

### Timeline

The **Timeline** tab provides a chronological view of the events and associated alerts that have been observed on the device. This can help you correlate any events, files, and IP addresses in relation to the device.

The timeline also enables you to selectively drill down into events that occurred within a given time period. You can view the temporal sequence of events that occurred on a device over a selected time period. To further control your view, you can filter by event groups or customize the columns.

> [!NOTE]
> For firewall events to be displayed, you'll need to enable the audit policy, see [Audit Filtering Platform connection](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-filtering-platform-connection).
>
> Firewall covers the following events:
>
> - [5025](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5025) - firewall service stopped
> - [5031](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5031) - application blocked from accepting incoming connections on the network
> - [5157](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5157) - blocked connection

:::image type="content" source="images/timeline-device.png" alt-text="The device timeline with events" lightbox="images/timeline-device.png":::

Some of the functionality includes:

- Search for specific events
  - Use the search bar to look for specific timeline events.
- Filter events from a specific date
  - Select the calendar icon in the upper left of the table to display events in the past day, week, 30 days, or custom range. By default, the device timeline is set to display the events from the past 30 days.
  - Use the timeline to jump to a specific moment in time by highlighting the section. The arrows on the timeline pinpoint automated investigations
- Export detailed device timeline events
  - Export the device timeline for the current date or a specified date range up to seven days.

More details about certain events are provided in the **Additional information** section. These details vary depending on the type of event, for example:

- Contained by Application Guard - the web browser event was restricted by an isolated container
- Active threat detected - the threat detection occurred while the threat was running
- Remediation unsuccessful - an attempt to remediate the detected threat was invoked but failed
- Remediation successful - the detected threat was stopped and cleaned
- Warning bypassed by user - the Windows Defender SmartScreen warning was dismissed and overridden by a user
- Suspicious script detected - a potentially malicious script was found running
- The alert category - if the event led to the generation of an alert, the alert category  ("Lateral Movement", for example) is provided

#### Event details

Select an event to view relevant details about that event. A panel displays to show general event information. When applicable and data is available, a graph showing related entities and their relationships are also shown.

To further inspect the event and related events, you can quickly run an [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) query by selecting **Hunt for related events**. The query will return the selected event and the list of other events that occurred around the same time on the same endpoint.

:::image type="content" source="images/missing-kbs-device.png" alt-text="The Missing KBs tab" lightbox="images/missing-kbs-device.png":::

## Cards

### Active alerts

The **Azure Advanced Threat Protection** card will display a high-level overview of alerts related to the device and their risk level, if you have enabled the Microsoft Defender for Identity feature, and there are any active alerts. More information is available in the "Alerts" drill down.

:::image type="content" source="images/risk-level-small.png" alt-text="The active alerts card" lightbox="images/risk-level-small.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to enable the integration on both Microsoft Defender for Identity and Defender for Endpoint to use this feature. In Defender for Endpoint, you can enable this feature in advanced features. For more information on how to enable advanced features, see [Turn on advanced features](advanced-features.md).

### Logged on users

The **Logged on users** card shows how many users have logged on in the past 30 days, along with the most and least frequent users. Selecting the "See all users" link opens the details pane, which displays information such as user type, log on type, and when the user was first and last seen. For more information, see [Investigate user entities](investigate-user.md).

:::image type="content" source="images/logged-on-users.png" alt-text="The user details pane" lightbox="images/logged-on-users.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The 'Most frequent' user value is calculated only based on evidence of users who successfully logged on interactively.
> However, the "All users" side-pane calculates all sorts of user logons so it is expected to see more frequent users in the side-pane, given that those users may not be interactive.

### Security assessments

The **Security assessments** card shows the overall exposure level, security recommendations, installed software, and discovered vulnerabilities. A device's exposure level is determined by the cumulative impact of its pending security recommendations.

:::image type="content" source="images/security-assessments.png" alt-text="The security assessments card" lightbox="images/security-assessments.png":::


### Device health status

The **Device health status** card shows a summarized health report for the specific device. One of the following status is displayed at the top of the card to indicate the overall status of the device:

- Device is up to date
- Platform is not up to date
- Full scan failed
- Quick scan failed
- Engine is not up to date
- Security intelligence is not up to date
- Defender Antivirus not active
- Status not available for macOS & Linux

Other information in the card include: the last full scan, last quick scan, security intelligence update version, engine update version, platform update version, and Defender Antivirus mode. 

>[!NOTE]
>The overall status message for macOS and Linux devices currently shows up as 'Status not available for macOS & Linux'. Currently, the status summary is only available for Windows devices. All other information in the table is up to date to show the individual states of each device health signal for all supported platforms. 

To gain an in-depth view of the device health report, you can go to **Reports > Devices health**. For more information, see [Device health and compliance report in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-reports).
