[Exploit protection](exploit-protection.md) helps protect against malware that uses exploits to infect devices and spread. Exploit protection consists of many mitigations that can be applied to either the operating system or individual apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET 2.0 is not compatible with some exploit protection capabilities, specifically, Export Address Filtering (EAF) and Import Address Filtering (IAF). If you have enabled .NET 2.0, usage of EAF and IAF are not supported.

Many features from the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) are included in exploit protection.

You can enable each mitigation separately by using any of these methods:

- [Windows Security app](#windows-security-app)
- [Microsoft Intune](#intune)
- [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](#mdm)
- [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](#microsoft-endpoint-configuration-manager)
- [Group Policy](#group-policy)
- [PowerShell](#powershell)

Exploit protection is configured by default in Windows 10 and Windows 11. You can set each mitigation to on, off, or to its default value. Some mitigations have more options. You can [export these settings as an XML file](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md) and deploy them to other devices.

You can also set mitigations to [audit mode](evaluate-exploit-protection.md). Audit mode allows you to test how the mitigations would work (and review events) without impacting the normal use of the device.

## Windows Security app

1. Open the Windows Security app by either selecting the shield icon in your task bar, or by searching the Start menu for **Security**.

2. Select the **App & browser control** tile (or the app icon on the left menu bar) and then select **Exploit protection settings**.

3. Go to **Program settings** and choose the app you want to apply mitigations to.
    - If the app you want to configure is already listed, select it, and then select **Edit**.
    - If the app is not listed, at the top of the list select **Add program to customize** and then choose how you want to add the app.
    - Use **Add by program name** to have the mitigation applied to any running process with that name. Specify a file with its extension. You can enter a full path to limit the mitigation to only the app with that name in that location.
    - Use **Choose exact file path** to use a standard Windows Explorer file picker window to find and select the file you want.

4. After selecting the app, you'll see a list of all the mitigations that can be applied. Choosing **Audit** will apply the mitigation in audit mode only. You are notified if you need to restart the process or app, or if you need to restart Windows.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the apps and mitigations you want to configure.

6. Under the **System settings** section, find the mitigation you want to configure and then specify one of the following settings. Apps that aren't configured individually in the **Program settings** section use the settings that are configured here.
    - **On by default**: The mitigation is *enabled* for apps that don't have this mitigation set in the app-specific **Program settings** section
    - **Off by default**: The mitigation is *disabled* for apps that don't have this mitigation set in the app-specific **Program settings** section
    - **Use default**: The mitigation is either enabled or disabled, depending on the default configuration that is set up by Windows 10 or Windows 11 installation; the default value (**On** or **Off**) is always specified next to the **Use default** label for each mitigation

7. Repeat step 6 for all the system-level mitigations you want to configure. Select **Apply** when you're done setting up your configuration.

If you add an app to the **Program settings** section and configure individual mitigation settings there, they will be honored above the configuration for the same mitigations specified in the **System settings** section. The following matrix and examples help to illustrate how defaults work:

|Enabled in **Program settings**|Enabled in **System settings**|Behavior|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Yes|No|As defined in **Program settings**|
|Yes|Yes|As defined in **Program settings**|
|No|Yes|As defined in **System settings**|
|No|No|Default as defined in **Use default** option|

### Example 1: Mikael configures Data Execution Prevention in system settings section to be off by default

Mikael adds the app *test.exe* to the **Program settings** section. In the options for that app, under **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**, Mikael enables the **Override system settings** option and sets the switch to **On**. There are no other apps listed in the **Program settings** section.

The result is that DEP is enabled only for *test.exe*. All other apps will not have DEP applied.

### Example 2: Josie configures Data Execution Prevention in system settings to be off by default

Josie adds the app *test.exe* to the **Program settings** section. In the options for that app, under **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**, Josie enables the **Override system settings** option and sets the switch to **On**.

Josie also adds the app *miles.exe* to the **Program settings** section and configures **Control flow guard (CFG)** to **On**. Josie doesn't enable the **Override system settings** option for DEP or any other mitigations for that app.

The result is that DEP is enabled for *test.exe*. DEP will not be enabled for any other app, including *miles.exe*. CFG will be enabled for *miles.exe*.

1. Open the Windows Security app by selecting the shield icon in the task bar or searching the start menu for **Windows Security**.

2. Select the **App & browser control** tile (or the app icon on the left menu bar) and then select **Exploit protection**.

3. Go to **Program settings** and choose the app you want to apply mitigations to.<br/>
    - If the app you want to configure is already listed, select it, and then select **Edit**.
    - If the app is not listed, at the top of the list select **Add program to customize** and then choose how you want to add the app.<br/>
      - Use **Add by program name** to have the mitigation applied to any running process with that name. Specify a file with an extension. You can enter a full path to limit the mitigation to only the app with that name in that location.
      - Use **Choose exact file path** to use a standard Windows Explorer file picker window to find and select the file you want.

4. After selecting the app, you'll see a list of all the mitigations that can be applied. Choosing **Audit** will apply the mitigation in audit mode only. You will be notified if you need to restart the process or app, or if you need to restart Windows.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the apps and mitigations you want to configure. Select **Apply** when you're done setting up your configuration.

## Intune

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open Intune.

2. Go to **Device configuration** \> **Profiles** \> **Create profile**.

4. Select **Enabled** and type the location of the [XML file](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-exploitguard), and then choose **OK**.

## PowerShell

You can use the PowerShell verb `Get` or `Set` with the cmdlet `ProcessMitigation`. Using `Get` will list the current configuration status of any mitigations that have been enabled on the device - add the `-Name` cmdlet and app exe to see mitigations for just that app:

```PowerShell
Get-ProcessMitigation -Name processName.exe
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System-level mitigations that have not been configured will show a status of `NOTSET`.
>
> - For system-level settings, `NOTSET` indicates the default setting for that mitigation has been applied.
> - For app-level settings, `NOTSET` indicates the system-level setting for the mitigation will be applied.
> The default setting for each system-level mitigation can be seen in the Windows Security.

Use `Set` to configure each mitigation in the following format:

```PowerShell
Set-ProcessMitigation -<scope> <app executable> -<action> <mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>
```

Where:

- \<Scope\>:
  - `-Name` to indicate the mitigations should be applied to a specific app. Specify the app's executable after this flag.
    - `-System` to indicate the mitigation should be applied at the system level
- \<Action\>:
  - `-Enable` to enable the mitigation
  - `-Disable` to disable the mitigation
- \<Mitigation\>:
  - The mitigation's cmdlet along with any suboptions (surrounded with spaces). Each mitigation is separated with a comma.

For example, to enable the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) mitigation with ATL thunk emulation and for an executable called *testing.exe* in the folder *C:\Apps\LOB\tests*, and to prevent that executable from creating child processes, you'd use the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name c:\apps\lob\tests\testing.exe -Enable DEP, EmulateAtlThunks, DisallowChildProcessCreation
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Separate each mitigation option with commas.

If you wanted to apply DEP at the system level, you'd use the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-Processmitigation -System -Enable DEP
```

To disable mitigations, you can replace `-Enable` with `-Disable`. However, for app-level mitigations, this action forces the mitigation to be disabled only for that app.

If you need to restore the mitigation back to the system default, you need to include the `-Remove` cmdlet as well, as in the following example:

```PowerShell
Set-Processmitigation -Name test.exe -Remove -Disable DEP
```

The following table lists the individual **Mitigations** (and **Audits**, when available) to be used with the `-Enable` or `-Disable` cmdlet parameters.<br/><br/>
