If your organization is using [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/) (Defender for Endpoint), [automated investigation and remediation capabilities](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations) can save your security operations team time and effort. As outlined in [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-atp/enhance-your-soc-with-microsoft-defender-atp-automatic/ba-p/848946), these capabilities mimic the ideal steps that a security analyst takes to investigate and remediate threats. [Learn more about automated investigation and remediation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations). 

To configure automated investigation and remediation,
1. [Turn on the features](#turn-on-automated-investigation-and-remediation); and 
2. [Set up device groups](#set-up-device-groups).

## Turn on automated investigation and remediation

1. As a global administrator or security administrator, go to the Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com)) and sign in.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.
3. In the **General** section, select **Advanced features**.
4. Turn on both **Automated Investigation** and **Automatically resolve alerts**.

## Set up device groups

1. In the Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com)), on the **Settings** page, under **Permissions**, select **Device groups**.
2. Select **+ Add device group**.
3. Create at least one device group, as follows:
   - Specify a name and description for the device group.
   - In the **Automation level list**, select a level, such as **Full â€“ remediate threats automatically**. The automation level determines whether remediation actions are taken automatically, or only upon approval.

   - In the **Members** section, use one or more conditions to identify and include devices.
   - On the **User access** tab, select the [Azure Active Directory groups](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups?context=azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/context/ugr-context) who should have access to the device group you're creating.
4. Select **Done** when you're finished setting up your device group.
