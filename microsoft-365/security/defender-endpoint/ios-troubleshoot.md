This topic provides troubleshooting information to help you address issues that may arise as you use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS.



> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint on iOS would use a VPN in order to provide the Web Protection feature. This is not a regular VPN and is a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.

## Apps don't work when VPN is turned on
There are some apps that stop functioning when an active VPN is detected. You can disable the VPN during the time you are using such apps. 

By default, Defender for Endpoint on iOS includes and enables the web protection feature. [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks. Defender for Endpoint on iOS uses a VPN in order to provide this protection. Please note this is a local VPN and unlike traditional VPN, network traffic is not sent outside the device.

While enabled by default, there might be some cases that require you to disable VPN. For example, you want to run some apps that do not work when a VPN is configured. In such cases, you can choose to disable VPN from the app on the device by following the steps below:

1. On your iOS device, open the **Settings** app, click or tap **General** and then **VPN**.
1. Click or tap the "i" button for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
1. Toggle off **Connect On Demand** to disable VPN.

> [!NOTE]
> Web Protection will not be available when VPN is disabled. To re-enable Web Protection, open the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app on the device and click or tap **Start VPN**.

## Co-existence with multiple VPN profiles

Apple iOS does not support multiple **device-wide** VPNs to be active simultaneously. While multiple VPN profiles can exist on the device, only one VPN can be active at a time.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint VPN can co-exist with other VPNs that are configured as *per-app* or *"Personal"*.

## Battery consumption

In the Settings app, iOS only shows battery usage of apps that are visible to the user for a specific duration of time. The battery usage by apps shown on the screen are only for that time duration and is computed by iOS based on a multitude of factors including CPU and Network usage. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses a local/loop-back VPN in the background to check web traffic for any malicious websites or connections. Network packets from any app go through this check and that causes the battery usage of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to be computed inaccurately. The actual battery consumption of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is much less than what is shown on the Battery Settings page on the device.

On an average, per-day battery usage by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint running on the background is **approximately 8.81% of overall battery consumed in that day**. This metric is reported by Apple based on actual usage of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on end-user devices and due to reasons mentioned above can also be accounted to other apps that have network activity.

Also, the VPN used is a local VPN and unlike a traditional VPN, network traffic is not sent outside the device.

## Data usage

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses a local/loopback VPN to check web traffic for any malicious websites or connections. Due to this reason, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data usage can be inaccurately accounted for. We have also observed that if the device is on cellular network only, the data usage reported by service provider is very close to the actual consumption whereas in the Settings app, Apple shows about 1.5x to 2x of actual data consumed.

We have similar observations with other VPN services as well and have reported this to Apple.

In addition, it is critical for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to be up to date with our backend services to provide better protection. However, we are working on optimizing the data usage by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Report unsafe site

Phishing websites impersonate trustworthy websites for the purpose of obtaining your personal or financial information. Visit the [Provide feedback about network protection](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission/exploitguard/networkprotection) page to report a website that could be a phishing site.

## Malicious site detected

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protects you against phishing or other web-based attacks. If a malicious site is detected, the connection is blocked and an alert is sent to the organization's Security Center portal. The alert includes the domain name of the connection, remote IP address and the device details.

In addition, a notification is shown on the iOS device. Tapping on the notification opens the following screen for the user to review the details.
