## API description

Runs a sequence of live response commands on a device

## Limitations

1. Rate limitations for this API are 10 calls per minute (additional requests are responded with HTTP 429).

2. 25 concurrently running sessions (requests exceeding the throttling limit receives a "429 - Too many requests" response).

3. If the machine isn't available, the session is queued for up to three days.

4. RunScript command timeouts after 10 minutes.

5. Live response commands can't be queued up and can only be executed one at a time.

6. If the machine that you're trying to run this API call is in an RBAC device group that doesn't have an automated remediation level assigned to it, you need to at least enable the minimum Remediation Level for a given Device Group.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.  

7. Multiple live response commands can be run on a single API call. However, when a live response command fails all the subsequent actions won't be executed.

8. Multiple live response sessions can't be executed on the same machine (if live response action is already running, subsequent requests are responded to with HTTP 400 - ActiveRequestAlreadyExists).

## Minimum Requirements
