(<a id="fn1">1</a>) Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2 will need to be onboarded using the instructions in [Onboard Windows servers](configure-server-endpoints.md#windows-server-2012-r2-and-windows-server-2016).


## Run a detection test

To verify that your onboarded devices are properly connected to Defender for Endpoint, you can run a detection test.

<br/><br/>

|Operating system|Guidance|
|---|---|
|Windows 10 or later<br/><br/>Windows Server 2022<br/><br/>Windows Server 2019<br/><br/>Windows Server, version 1803, or later<br/><br/>Windows Server 2016<br/><br/>Windows Server 2012 R2|See [Run a detection test](run-detection-test.md).<br/><br/>Visit the Defender for Endpoint demo scenarios site (<https://demo.wd.microsoft.com>) and try one or more of the scenarios. For example, try the **Cloud-delivered protection** demo scenario.|
|macOS (see [System requirements](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md))|Download and use the DIY app at <https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy>. <br/><br/> For more information, see [Defender for Endpoint on macOS](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md).|
|Linux (see [System requirements](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md#system-requirements))|1. Run the following command, and look for a result of **1**: `mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled`.<br/><br/>2. Open a Terminal window, and run the following command: `curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt`.<br/><br/>3. Run the following command to list any detected threats: `mdatp threat list`.<br/><br/>For more information, see [Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md).|


## Confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in passive mode on your endpoints

Now that your endpoints have been onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, your next step is to make sure Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. You can use one of several methods, as described in the following table:

<br/><br/>

|Method|What to do|
|---|---|
|Command Prompt|1. On a Windows device, open Command Prompt.<br/><br/>2. Type `sc query windefend`, and then press Enter.<br/><br/>3. Review the results to confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode.|
|PowerShell|1. On a Windows device, open Windows PowerShell as an administrator.<br/><br/>2. Run following PowerShell cmdlet: `Get-MpComputerStatus|select AMRunningMode`. <br/><br/>3. Review the results. You should see **Passive mode**.|
|Windows Security app|1. On a Windows device, open the Windows Security app.<br/><br/>2. Select **Virus & threat protection**.<br/><br/>3. Under **Who's protecting me?** select **Manage providers**.<br/><br/>4. On the **Security providers** page, under **Antivirus**, look for **Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on**.|
|Task Manager|1. On a Windows device, open the Task Manager app.<br/><br/>2. Select the **Details** tab. Look for **MsMpEng.exe** in the list.|

> [!NOTE]
> You might see *Windows Defender Antivirus* instead of *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* in some versions of Windows.
> To learn more about passive mode and active mode, see [More details about Microsoft Defender Antivirus states](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md#more-details-about-microsoft-defender-antivirus-states).

### Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server to passive mode manually

To set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, or Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022, follow these steps:

1. Open Registry Editor, and then navigate to:

   `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.

2. Edit (or create) a DWORD entry called **ForceDefenderPassiveMode**, and specify the following settings:
   - Set the DWORD's value to **1**.
   - Under **Base**, select **Hexadecimal**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use other methods to set the registry key, such as the following:
>
> - [Group Policy Preference](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn581922(v=ws.11))
> - [Local Group Policy Object tool](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool)
> - [A package in Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs)

### Start Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2016

If you are using Windows Server 2016, you might have to start Microsoft Defender Antivirus manually. You can perform this task by using the PowerShell cmdlet `mpcmdrun.exe -wdenable` on the device.

## Get updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date is critical to assure your devices have the latest technology and features needed to protect against new malware and attack techniques, even if Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. (See [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).)

There are two types of updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date:

- Security intelligence updates
- Product updates

To get your updates, follow the guidance in [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

## Uninstall your non-Microsoft solution

If at this point you have:

- Onboarded your organization's devices to Defender for Endpoint, and
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus is installed and enabled,

Then your next step is to uninstall your non-Microsoft antivirus, antimalware, and endpoint protection solution. When you uninstall your non-Microsoft solution, Microsoft Defender Antivirus switches from passive mode to active mode. In most cases, this happens automatically.

To get help with uninstalling your non-Microsoft solution, contact their technical support team.

## Make sure Defender for Endpoint is working correctly

Now that you have onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, and you have uninstalled your former non-Microsoft solution, your next step is to make sure that Defender for Endpoint working correctly. One good way to perform this task is by visiting the Defender for Endpoint demo scenarios site ([https://demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com)). Try one or more of the demo scenarios on that page, including at least the following:

- Cloud-delivered protection
- Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA)
- Network Protection (NP)
