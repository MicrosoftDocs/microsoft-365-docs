# Device control report

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint device control protects against data loss by monitoring and controlling media use by devices in your organization, such as using removable storage devices and USB drives. You can use device control events through:

- **Advanced hunting**; and
- the **Device control report**. 

Select each tab to learn more about these methods.

## [**Advanced hunting**](#tab/advhunt)


## Advanced hunting

**Applies to:** 

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

The [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting) shows events triggered by the Device Control Removable Storage Access Control and Printer Protection. To access the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you must have the following subscription:

- Microsoft 365 for E5 reporting

- **RemovableStoragePolicyTriggered:** Shows the event triggered by Disk and file system level enforcement for both printer and removable storage when the `AuditAllowed` or `AuditDenied` is configured in your policy and **Send event** is selected in **Options**.
- **RemovableStorageFileEvent:** Shows the event triggered by the Evidence file feature for both printer and removable storage when **Options**  8 is configured in **Allow** Entry.

The event is sent to Advanced hunting or the device control report for every covered access (`AccessMask` in the entry), regardless of whether it was initiated by the system or by the user who signed in.

```kusto

## [**Device control report**](#tab/report)

## Device control report

**Applies to:** 
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Business](/microsoft-365/security/defender-business)


With the device control report, you can view events that relate to media usage. Such events include:

- **Audit events:** Shows the number of audit events that occur when external media is connected.
- **Policy events:** Shows the number of policy events that occur when a device control policy is triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> The audit event to track media usage is enabled by default for devices onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### Understanding the audit events

The audit events include:

- **USB drive mount and unmount:** Audit events that are generated when a USB drive is mounted or unmounted.
- **PnP:** Plug and Play audit events are generated when removable storage, a printer, or Bluetooth media is connected.
- **Removable storage access control:** Events are generated when a removable storage access control policy is triggered. It can be Audit, Block, or Allow.

### Monitor device control security

Device control in Defender for Endpoint empowers security administrators with tools that enable them to track their organization's device control security through reports. You can find the device control report in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). Go to **Reports** > **Endpoints**. Find **Device control** card, and select the link to open the report. 

In the **Reports** dashboard, the **Device protection** card shows the number of audit events generated by media type, over the last 180 days. Under **View details**, raw events over the last 30 days are listed.

The **View details** button shows more media usage data in the **Device control report** page.

The page provides a dashboard with aggregated number of events per type and a list of events and shows 500 events per page, but if you're an administrator (such as a global administrator or security administrator), you can scroll down to see more events and can filter on time range, media class name, and device ID.

When you select an event, a flyout appears that shows you more information:

- **General details:** Date, Action mode, the policy, and Access of this event.
- **Media information:** Media information includes Media name, Class name, Class GUID, Device ID, Vendor ID, Serial number, and Bus type.
- **Location details:** Device name, User, and MDATP device ID.

To see real-time activity for this media across the organization, select the **Open Advanced hunting** button. This includes an embedded, predefined query.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="images/Devicecontrolreportquery.png" alt-text="The Query On Device Control Report page" lightbox="images/Devicecontrolreportquery.png":::

To see the security of the device, select the **Open device page** button on the flyout. This button opens the device entity page.

### Reporting delays

There might be a delay of up to six hours from the time a media connection occurs to the time the event is reflected in the card or in the domain list.

> [!NOTE]
> When you export data, such as a list of events, from the device control report to Excel, up to 500 events are exported. However, if your organization is using Microsoft Sentinel, you can integrate Defender for Endpoint with Sentinel so that all incidents and alerts are streamed. For more information, see [Connect data from Microsoft 365 Defender to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/connect-microsoft-365-defender).
