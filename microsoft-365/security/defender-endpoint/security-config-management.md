1.  Verify that the device appears in the Device Inventory section of [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/).

2.  In the [Azure Active Directory portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_Devices/DevicesMenuBlade/Devices/menuId/), verify that the device has successfully been enrolled.

3.  In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/mDMDevicesPreview),  verify that the device has successfully been enrolled by looking it up in the **Devices > All devices** section.
