## SIEM integration

Defender for Endpoint supports SIEM integration through various of methods. This can include specialized SIEM system interface with out of the box connectors, a generic alert API enabling custom implementations, and an action API enabling alert status management.

## Ticketing and IT service management

Ticketing solution integration helps to implement manual and automatic response processes. Defender for Endpoint can help to create tickets automatically when an alert is generated and resolve the alerts when tickets are closed using the alerts API.

## Security orchestration and automation response (SOAR) integration

Orchestration solutions can help build playbooks and integrate the rich data model and actions that Defender for Endpoint APIs exposes to orchestrate responses, such as query for device data, trigger device isolation, block/allow, resolve alert and others.

## External alert correlation and Automated investigation and remediation

Defender for Endpoint offers unique automated investigation and remediation capabilities to drive incident response at scale.

Integrating the automated investigation and response capability with other solutions such as IDS and firewalls help to address alerts and minimize the complexities surrounding network and device signal correlation, effectively streamlining the investigation and threat remediation actions on devices.

External alerts can be pushed to Defender for Endpoint. These alerts are shown side by side with additional device-based alerts from Defender for Endpoint. This view provides a full context of the alert and can reveal the full story of an attack.

## Indicators matching

You can use threat-intelligence from providers and aggregators to maintain and use indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Defender for Endpoint allows you to integrate with these solutions and act on IoCs by correlating rich telemetry to create alerts. You can also use prevention and automated response capabilities to block execution and take remediation actions when there's a match.

Defender for Endpoint currently supports IOC matching and remediation for file and network indicators. Blocking is supported for file indicators.

## Support for non-Windows platforms

Defender for Endpoint provides a centralized security operations experience for Windows and non-Windows platforms, including mobile devices. You'll be able to see alerts from various supported operating systems (OS) in the portal and better protect your organization's network.
