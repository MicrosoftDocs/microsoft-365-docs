# Export non product code software inventory assessment per device

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](../defender-vulnerability-management/index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-exposedapis-abovefoldlink)

This API returns all the data for installed software that doesn't have a [Common Platform Enumeration(CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe), on a per-device basis. The information returned by this API, along with the information returned by the [Export software inventory assessment](get-assessment-non-cpe-software-inventory.md) API, for software that does have a CPE, gives you full visibility into the software installed across your organization and the devices it’s installed on.

> [!NOTE]
> Software products without a CPE are not supported by vulnerability management. They will be shown in the software inventory page, but because CPEs are used by vulnerability management to identify the software and any vulnerabilities, information like, exploits, number of exposed devices, and weaknesses won't be available for them. For more information, see [Software inventory](../defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-software-inventory.md).

Different API calls get different types of data. Because the amount of data can be large, there are two ways it can be retrieved:

- [Export non product code software inventory assessment **JSON response**](#1-export-non-product-code-software-inventory-assessment-json-response) The API pulls all data in your organization as Json responses. This method is best for _small organizations with less than 100-K devices_. The response is paginated, so you can use the \@odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.

- [Export non product code software inventory assessment **via files**](#2-export-non-product-code-software-inventory-assessment-via-files)  This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows:
  - Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.
  - Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.

Data that is collected (using either _Json response_ or _via files_) is the current snapshot of the current state. It doesn't contain historic data. To collect historic data, customers must save the data in their own data storages.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless indicated otherwise, all export assessment methods listed are **_full export_** and **_by device_** (also referred to as **_per device_**).

## 1. Export non product code software inventory assessment (JSON response)

### 1.1 API method description

This API response contains all the data of installed software that does not have a [Common Platform Enumeration(CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) per device. Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion.

#### Limitations

- Maximum page size is 200,000.
- Rate limitations for this API are 30 calls per minute and 1000 calls per hour.

### 1.2 Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs for details.](apis-intro.md)

Permission type|Permission|Permission display name
---|---|---
Application|Software.Read.All|\'Read Threat and Vulnerability Management vulnerability information\'
Delegated (work or school account)|Software.Read|\'Read Threat and Vulnerability Management vulnerability information\'

### 1.3 URL

```http
GET /api/machines/SoftwareInventoryNoProductCodeByMachine
```

### 1.4 Parameters

- pageSize (default = 50,000): Number of results in response.
- $top: Number of results to return (doesn't return @odata.nextLink and therefore doesn't pull all the data)

### 1.5 Properties

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each record is approximately 0.5KB of data. You should take this into account when choosing the correct pageSize parameter for you.
> - The properties defined in the following table are listed alphabetically, by property ID. When running this API, the resulting output will not necessarily be returned in the same order listed in this table.
> - Some additional columns might be returned in the response. These columns are temporary and might be removed, please use only the documented columns.
