# Configure Defender for Endpoint on Android features

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

## Conditional Access with Defender for Endpoint on Android

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android, along with Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory, enables enforcing Device compliance and Conditional Access policies based on device risk levels. Defender for Endpoint is a Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) solution that you can deploy through Intune.

For more information about how to set up Defender for Endpoint on Android and Conditional Access, see [Defender for Endpoint and Intune](/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection).

## Configure custom indicators

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint on Android only supports creating custom indicators for IP addresses and URLs/domains.

Defender for Endpoint on Android enables admins to configure custom indicators to support Android devices as well. For more information on how to configure custom indicators, see [Manage indicators](manage-indicators.md).

## Configure web protection

Defender for Endpoint on Android allows IT Administrators the ability to configure the web protection feature. This capability is available within the Microsoft Intune admin center.

[Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks. Anti-phishing and custom indicators (URL and IP addresses) are supported as part of web protection. Web content filtering is currently not supported on mobile platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint on Android would use a VPN in order to provide the Web Protection feature. This VPN is not a regular VPN. Instead, it's a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.

> For more information, see [Configure web protection on devices that run Android](/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection-manage-android).

## Network Protection

This feature provides protection against rogue Wi-Fi related threats and rogue certificates, which are the primary attack vector for Wi-Fi networks. Admins can list the root Certificate Authority (CA) and private root CA certificates in Microsoft Intune admin center and establish trust with endpoints. It provides the user a guided experience to connect to secure networks and also notifies them if a related threat is detected.

It includes several admin controls to offer flexibility, such as the ability to configure the feature from within the Microsoft Intune admin center and add trusted certificates. Admins can enable [privacy controls](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/android-configure#privacy-controls) to configure the data sent to Defender for Endpoint from Android devices.

Network protection in Microsoft Defender for endpoint is disabled by default. Admins can use the following steps to **configure Network protection in Android devices.**

1. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, navigate to Apps > App configuration policies. Create a new App configuration policy.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of how to create a policy.](images/android-mem.png)

1. Provide a name and description to uniquely identify the policy. Select **'Android Enterprise'** as the platform and **'Personally-owned work profile only'** as the profile type and **'Microsoft Defender'** as the Targeted app.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of policy details.](images/appconfigdetails.png)

1. In Settings page, select **'Use configuration designer'** and add **'Enable Network Protection in Microsoft Defender'** as the key and value as **'1'** to enable Network Protection. (Network protection is disabled by default)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of how to select enable network protection policy](images/selectnp.png)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of add configuration policy.](images/npvalue.png)

1. If your organization uses root CAs that are private, you must establish explicit trust between Intune (MDM solution) and user devices. Establishing trust helps prevent Defender from flagging root CAs as rogue certificates.

    To establish trust for the root CAs, use **'Trusted CA certificate list for Network Protection'** as the key. In the value, add the **'comma separated list of certificate thumbprints (SHA 1)'**.

    **Example of Thumbprint format to add**: `50 30 06 09 1d 97 d4 f5 ae 39 f7 cb e7 92 7d 7d 65 2d 34 31, 503006091d97d4f5ae39f7cbe7927d7d652d3431`

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint characters should be with either white space separated, or non separated.
   >
   > This format is invalid: `50:30:06:09:1d:97:d4:f5:ae:39:f7:cb:e7:92:7d:7d:65:2d:34:31`

   Any other separation characters are invalid.

1. For other configurations related to Network protection, add the following keys and appropriate corresponding value.

    | Configuration Key| Description|
    |---|---|
    |Trusted CA certificate list for Network Protection|Security admins manage this setting to establish trust for root CA and self-signed certificates.|
    |Enable Network protection in Microsoft Defender|1 - Enable, 0- Disable (default). This setting is used by the IT admin to enable or disable the network protection capabilities in the Defender app.|
    |Enable Network Protection Privacy|1 - Enable (default), 0 - Disable. Security admins manage this setting to enable or disable privacy in network protection.|
    |Enable Users to Trust Networks and Certificates|1 - Enable, 0 - Disable (default). Security admins manage this setting to enable or disable the end user's in-app experience to trust and untrust unsecure and suspicious networks and malicious certificates.|
    |Automatic Remediation of Network Protection Alerts|1 - Enable (default), 0 - Disable. Security admins manage this setting to enable or disable the remediation alerts that are sent when a user performs remediation activities, such as switching to a safer Wi-Fi access point or deleting suspicious certificates detected by Defender.|
    |Manage Network Protection detection for Open Networks|0 - Disable (default), 1 - Audit Mode, 2 - Enable. Security admins manage this setting to disable, audit, or enable open network detection, respectively. In 'Audit' mode, alerts are sent only to the ATP portal with no end user experience. For user experience, set the config to 'Enable' mode.|  
    |Manage Network protection Detection for Certificates|0 - Disable, 1 - Audit mode (default), 2 - Enable. When network protection is enabled, Audit mode for certificate detection is enabled by default. In Audit mode, notification alerts are sent to SOC admins, but no end-user notifications are displayed to the user when Defender detects a bad certificate. Admins can, however, disable this detection with 0 as the value and enable full feature functionality by setting 2 as the value. When the feature is enabled with the value of 2, end-user notifications are sent to the user when Defender detects a bad certificate, and alerts are also sent to the SOC Admin.|

6. Add the required groups to which the policy will have to be applied. Review and create the policy.

    | Configuration Key| Description|
    |---|---|
    |Enable Network protection in Microsoft Defender|1: Enable <br/> 0: Disable (default) <br/><br/> This setting is used by the IT admin to enable or disable the network protection capabilities in the Defender app.|
    |Enable Network Protection Privacy|1: Enable (default) <br/> 0: Disable <br/><br/> Security admins manage this setting to enable or disable privacy in network protection.|
    |Enable Users to Trust Networks and Certificates|1 <br/> Enable <br/> 0:Disable (default) <br/><br/> This setting is used by IT admins to enable or disable the end user in-app experience to trust and untrust the unsecure and suspicious networks and malicious certificates.|
    |Automatic Remediation of Network Protection Alerts|1: Enable (default) <br/> 0: Disable <br/><br/> This setting is used by IT admins to enable or disable the remediation alerts that are sent when a user does remediation activities. For example, the user switches to a safer Wi-Fi access point or deletes suspicious certificates that were detected by Defender.|
    |Manage Network Protection detection for Open Networks|0: Disable (default) <br/> 1: Audit Mode <br/><br/> Security admins manage this setting to enable or disable open network detection.|
    |Manage Network protection Detection for Certificates|0: Disable <br/> 1: Audit mode (default) <br/> 2: Enable <br/><br/> When network protection is enabled, Audit mode for certificate detection is enabled by default. In audit mode, notification alerts are sent to SOC admins, but no end user notifications are shown when Defender detects a bad certificate. Admins can disable this detection with the value 0 or enable full feature functionality by setting the value 2. When the value is 2, end user notifications are sent to users and alerts are sent to SOC admins when Defender detects a bad certificate.|

1. Add the required groups to which the policy has to be applied. Review and create the policy.

> [!NOTE]
> Users need to enable location permission (which is an optional permission); this enables Defender for Endpoint to scan their networks and alert them when there are WIFI-related threats. If the location permission is denied by the user, Defender for Endpoint will only be able to provide limited protection against network threats and will only protect the users from rogue certificates.


## Privacy Controls

Following privacy controls are available for configuring the data that is sent by Defender for Endpoint from Android devices:

|Threat Report     |Details      |
