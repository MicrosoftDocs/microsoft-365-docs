- Are fully supported by Microsoft.
- May only be available in selected geographic regions or cloud environments. For example, the feature may not exist in the government cloud.
- Individual features in preview may have more usage and support restrictions. If so, this information is typically noted in the feature documentation.
- The preview versions are provided with a standard support level, and can be used for production environments.
