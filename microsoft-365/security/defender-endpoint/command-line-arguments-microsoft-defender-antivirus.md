# Configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus with the mpcmdrun.exe command-line tool

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)

You can perform various functions in Microsoft Defender Antivirus using the dedicated command-line tool **mpcmdrun.exe**. This utility is useful when you want to automate Microsoft Defender Antivirus tasks. You can find the utility in `%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe`. Run it from a command prompt.

> [!TIP]
> You might need to open an administrator-level version of the command prompt. When you search for **Command Prompt** on the Start menu, choose **Run as administrator**. If you're running an updated Microsoft Defender Platform version, run `MpCmdRun` from the following location: `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<antimalware platform version>`. For more information about the antimalware platform, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

The MpCmdRun utility uses the following syntax:

```console
MpCmdRun.exe [command] [-options]
```

Here's an example:

```console
MpCmdRun.exe -Scan -ScanType 2
``` 

In our example, the MpCmdRun utility starts a full antivirus scan on the device.
