> - The standalone versions of [Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2](defender-endpoint-plan-1-2.md) do not include server licenses. To onboard servers to those plans, you'll need either Defender for Endpoint for Servers, or Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2 (as part of the [Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) offering). To learn more. see [Defender for Endpoint onboarding Windows Server](onboard-windows-server.md).

When components are up-to-date on Microsoft Windows operating systems, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support will follow the respective operating system's lifecycle. For more information, see [Lifecycle FAQ](/lifecycle/faq/general-lifecycle). New features or capabilities are typically provided only on operating systems that have not yet reached the end of their lifecycle. Security intelligence updates (definition and engine updates) and detection logic will continue to be provided until at least:

- The [end of support date](/lifecycle/products/) (for operating systems that do not have an Extended Security Updates (ESU) program).
- The [end of ESU date](/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates) (for operating systems that have an ESU program).

### Other supported operating systems

- [macOS](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md)
- [Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md)
- [Android](microsoft-defender-endpoint-android.md)
- [iOS](microsoft-defender-endpoint-ios.md)


> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to confirm the Linux distributions and versions of Android, iOS, and macOS are compatible with Defender for Endpoint for the integration to work.

### Network and data storage and configuration requirements

When you run the onboarding wizard for the first time, you must choose where your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint-related information is stored: in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or the United States datacenter.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You cannot change your data storage location after the first-time setup.
> - Review the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data storage and privacy](data-storage-privacy.md) for more information on where and how Microsoft stores your data.

#### Internet connectivity

Internet connectivity on devices is required either directly or through proxy.

For more information on additional proxy configuration settings, see [Configure device proxy and Internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy-internet.md).

## Microsoft Defender Antivirus configuration requirement

The Defender for Endpoint agent depends on the ability of Microsoft Defender Antivirus to scan files and provide information about them.

Configure Security intelligence updates on the Defender for Endpoint devices whether Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the active antimalware or not. For more information, see [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus).

When Microsoft Defender Antivirus isn't the active antimalware in your organization and you use the Defender for Endpoint service, Microsoft Defender Antivirus goes on passive mode.

If your organization has turned off Microsoft Defender Antivirus through group policy or other methods, devices that are onboarded must be excluded from this group policy.

If you're onboarding servers and Microsoft Defender Antivirus isn't the active antimalware on your servers, Microsoft Defender Antivirus will either need to be configured to go on passive mode or uninstalled. The configuration is dependent on the server version. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Your regular group policy doesn't apply to Tamper Protection, and changes to Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings will be ignored when Tamper Protection is on.

## Microsoft Defender Antivirus Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver is enabled

If you're running Microsoft Defender Antivirus as the primary antimalware product on your devices, the Defender for Endpoint agent will successfully onboard.

If you're running a third-party antimalware client and use Mobile Device Management solutions or Microsoft Endpoint Manager (current branch), you'll need to ensure the Microsoft Defender Antivirus ELAM driver is enabled. For more information, see [Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by policy](troubleshoot-onboarding.md#ensure-that-microsoft-defender-antivirus-is-not-disabled-by-a-policy).
