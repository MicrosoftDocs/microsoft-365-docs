# Create a custom gradual rollout process for Microsoft Defender updates

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

**Platforms**
- Windows

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus version 4.18.2106.X or newer.

To create your own custom gradual rollout process for Defender updates, you can use Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Manager, and PowerShell.

The following table lists the available group policy settings for configuring update channels:

<br>

****

|Setting title|Description|Location|
|---|---|---|
|Select gradual Microsoft Defender monthly platform update rollout channel|Enable this policy to specify when devices receive Microsoft Defender platform updates during the monthly gradual rollout. <p> Beta Channel: Devices set to this channel will be the first to receive new updates. Select Beta Channel to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft. Devices in the Windows Insider Program are subscribed to this channel by default. For use in (manual) test environments only and a limited number of devices. <p> Current Channel (Preview): Devices set to this channel will be offered updates earliest during the monthly gradual release cycle. Suggested for pre-production/validation environments. <p> Current Channel (Staged): Devices will be offered updates after the monthly gradual release cycle. Suggested to apply to a small, representative part of your production population (~10%). <p> Current Channel (Broad): Devices will be offered updates only after the gradual release cycle completes. Suggested to apply to a broad set of devices in your production population (~10-100%). <p> Critical- Time Delay: Devices will be offered updates with a 48-hour delay. Suggested for critical environments only. <p>If you disable or do not configure this policy, the device will stay up to date automatically during the gradual release cycle. Suitable for most devices.|Windows Components\Microsoft Defender Antivirus|
|Select gradual Microsoft Defender monthly engine update rollout channel|Enable this policy to specify when devices receive Microsoft Defender engine updates during the monthly gradual rollout. <p> Beta Channel: Devices set to this channel will be the first to receive new updates. Select Beta Channel to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft. Devices in the Windows Insider Program are subscribed to this channel by default. For use in (manual) test environments only and a limited number of devices. <p> Current Channel (Preview): Devices set to this channel will be offered updates earliest during the monthly gradual release cycle. Suggested for pre-production/validation environments. <p> Current Channel (Staged): Devices will be offered updates after the monthly gradual release cycle. Suggested to apply to a small, representative part of your production population (~10%). <p> Current Channel (Broad): Devices will be offered updates only after the gradual release cycle completes. Suggested to apply to a broad set of devices in your production population (~10-100%). <p> Critical- Time Delay: Devices will be offered updates with a 48-hour delay. Suggested for critical environments only.<p> If you disable or do not configure this policy, the device will stay up to date automatically during the gradual release cycle. Suitable for most devices.|Windows Components\Microsoft Defender Antivirus|
|Select gradual Microsoft Defender daily security intelligence updates rollout channel|Enable this policy to specify when devices receive Microsoft Defender security intelligence updates during the daily gradual rollout. <p> Current Channel (Staged): Devices will be offered updates after the release cycle. Suggested to apply to a small, representative part of production population (~10%). <p> Current Channel (Broad): Devices will be offered updates only after the gradual release cycle completes. Suggested to apply to a broad set of devices in your production population (~10-100%). <p>  If you disable or do not configure this policy, the device will stay up to date automatically during the daily release cycle. Suitable for most devices.|Windows Components\Microsoft Defender Antivirus|
|Disable gradual rollout of Microsoft Defender updates|Enable this policy to disable gradual rollout of Defender updates. <p> Current Channel (Broad): Devices set to this channel will be offered updates last during the gradual release cycle. Best for datacenter machines that only receive limited updates. <p> Note: This setting applies to both monthly as well as daily Defender updates and will override any previously configured channel selections for platform and engine updates. <p> If you disable or do not configure this policy, the device will remain in Current Channel (Default) unless specified otherwise in specific channels for platform and engine updates. Stay up to date automatically during the gradual release cycle. Suitable for most devices.|Windows Components\Microsoft Defender Antivirus|

## Group Policy

> [!NOTE]
> An updated Defender ADMX template will be published together with the 21H2 release of Windows 10. A non-localized version is available for download at https://github.com/microsoft/defender-updatecontrols.

You can use [Group Policy](/windows/win32/srvnodes/group-policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN) to configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your endpoints.

In general, you can use the following procedure to configure or change Microsoft Defender Antivirus group policy settings:

1. On your Group Policy management machine, open the **Group Policy Management Console**, right-click the **Group Policy Object** (GPO) you want to configure and click **Edit**.

2. Using the Group Policy Management Editor go to **Computer configuration**.

3. Click **Administrative templates**.

4. Expand the tree to **Windows components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus**.

5. Expand the section (referred to as **Location** in the table in this topic) that contains the setting you want to configure, double-click the setting to open it, and make configuration changes.

6. [Deploy the updated GPO as you normally do](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee663280(v=vs.85).aspx).

## Intune

Follow the instructions in below link to create a custom policy in Intune:

[Add custom settings for Windows 10 devices in Microsoft Intune - Azure \|Microsoft Docs](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-settings-windows-10)

For more information on the Defender CSP used for the gradual rollout process, see [Defender CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/defender-csp).

## PowerShell

Use the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet to configure roll out of the gradual updates.

Use the following parameters:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference
-PlatformUpdatesChannel Beta|Preview|Staged|Broad|Delayed|NotConfigured
-EngineUpdatesChannel Beta|Preview|Staged|Broad|Delayed|NotConfigured
-DisableGradualRelease True|False
-SignaturesUpdatesChannel Staged|Broad|NotConfigured
```

Example:

Use `Set-MpPreference -PlatformUpdatesChannel Beta` to configure platform updates to arrive from the Beta Channel.

For more information on the parameters and how to configure them, see [Set-MpPreference (Microsoft Defender Antivirus)|Microsoft Docs](/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference).
