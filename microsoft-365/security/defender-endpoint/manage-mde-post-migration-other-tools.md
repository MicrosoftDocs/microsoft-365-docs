> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](/mem) to manage your organization's threat protection features for devices (also referred to as endpoints). Endpoint Manager includes [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) and [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction).

You can manage some Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings on devices with [PowerShell](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-powershell),  [Windows Management Instrumentation](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-windows-management-instrumentation-wmi) (WMI), and the [Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-microsoft-malware-protection-command-line-utility-mpcmdrunexe) (MPCmdRun.exe). For example, you can manage some Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings. And, in some cases, you can customize your attack surface reduction rules and exploit protection settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threat protection features that you configure by using PowerShell, WMI, or MCPmdRun.exe can be overwritten by configuration settings that are deployed with Intune or Configuration Manager.

## Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus, exploit protection, and your attack surface reduction rules.

## Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Malware Protection Command-Line Utility (MPCmdRun.exe)

On an individual device, you can run a scan, start diagnostic tracing, check for security intelligence updates, and more using the mpcmdrun.exe command-line tool. You can find the utility in `%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe`. Run it from a command prompt.

To learn more, see [Configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus with mpcmdrun.exe](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus).

## Configure your Microsoft 365 Defender portal

If you haven't already done so, configure your <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> to view alerts, configure threat protection features, and view detailed information about your organization's overall security posture.

You can also configure whether and what features end users can see in the Microsoft Defender Security Center.
