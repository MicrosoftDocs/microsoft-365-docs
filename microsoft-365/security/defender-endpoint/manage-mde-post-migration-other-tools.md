# Manage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with PowerShell, WMI, and MPCmdRun.exe

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-exposedapis-abovefoldlink)

We recommend using [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) or [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) to manage Defender for Endpoint settings. However, you can use other tools to manage some settings, such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, exploit protection, and customized attack surface reduction rules with:

- [PowerShell](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-powershell);
- [Windows Management Instrumentation](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-windows-management-instrumentation-wmi) (WMI); and
- The [Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility](#configure-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-microsoft-malware-protection-command-line-utility-mpcmdrunexe) (MPCmdRun.exe). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threat protection features that you configure by using PowerShell, WMI, or MCPmdRun.exe can be overwritten by configuration settings that are deployed with Intune or Configuration Manager.

## Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus, exploit protection, and your attack surface reduction rules.

## Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Malware Protection Command-Line Utility (MPCmdRun.exe)

On an individual device, you can run a scan, start diagnostic tracing, check for security intelligence updates, and more using the mpcmdrun.exe command-line tool. You can find the utility in `%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe`. Run it from a command prompt.

To learn more, see [Configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus with mpcmdrun.exe](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus).

## Configure your Microsoft 365 Defender portal

If you haven't already done so, configure your <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> to view alerts, configure threat protection features, and view detailed information about your organization's overall security posture.

You can also configure whether and what features end users can see.
