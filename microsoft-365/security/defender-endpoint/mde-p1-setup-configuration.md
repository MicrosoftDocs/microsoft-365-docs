## Plan your deployment

When you plan your deployment, you can choose from several different architectures and deployment methods. Every organization is unique, so you have several options to consider, as listed in the following table: <br/><br/>

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) (included in Microsoft Endpoint Manager) | Use Intune to manage endpoints in a cloud native environment |
| [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) and [Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) (included in Microsoft Endpoint Manager) | Use Intune and Configuration Manager to manage endpoints and workloads that span an on-premises and cloud environment |
| [Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) | Use Configuration Manager to protect on-premises endpoints with the cloud-based power of Defender for Endpoint |
| Local script downloaded from the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal | Use local scripts on endpoints to run a pilot or onboard just a few devices |

To learn more about your deployment options, see [Plan your Defender for Endpoint deployment](deployment-strategy.md). And, download the following poster: 

[:::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-endpoint/mde-deployment-strategy.png" alt-text="Deployment strategy poster thumbnail":::](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/6/0/5609001f-b8ae-412f-89eb-643976f6b79c/mde-deployment-strategy.pdf)

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information about planning your deployment, see [Plan your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployment](deployment-strategy.md).

## Set up your tenant environment

Setting up your tenant environment includes tasks, such as:

- Verifying your licenses
- Configuring your tenant
- Configuring your proxy settings (only if necessary)
- Making sure sensors are working correctly and reporting data to Defender for Endpoint 

These tasks are included in the setup phase for Defender for Endpoint. See [Set up Defender for Endpoint](production-deployment.md).

## Assign roles and permissions

In order to access the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, configure settings for Defender for Endpoint, or perform tasks, such as taking response actions on detected threats, appropriate permissions must be assigned. Defender for Endpoint uses [built-in roles within Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). 

Microsoft recommends assigning users only the level of permission they need to perform their tasks. You can assign permissions by using basic permissions management, or by using [role-based access control](rbac.md) (RBAC). 

- With basic permissions management, global admins and security admins have full access, whereas security readers read-only access.
- With RBAC, you can set more granular permissions through more roles. For example, you can have security readers, security operators, security admins, endpoint administrators, and more.


The following table describes key roles to consider for Defender for Endpoint in your organization: <br/><br/>

| Role | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Global administrators (also referred to as global admins) <br/><br/> *As a best practice, limit the number of global administrators.* | Global admins can perform all kinds of tasks. The person who signed up your company for Microsoft 365 or for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 is a global administrator by default. <br/><br/> Global admins are able to access/change settings across all Microsoft 365 portals, such as: <br/>- The Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) <br/>- Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <br/>- Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com))  |
| Security administrators (also referred to as security admins) | Security admins can perform security operator tasks plus the following tasks: <br/>- Monitor security-related policies <br/>- Manage security threats and alerts <br/>- View reports |
| Security operator | Security operators can perform security reader tasks plus the following tasks: <br/>- View information about detected threats <br/>- Investigate and respond to detected threats  |
| Security reader | Security readers can perform the following tasks: <br/>- View security-related policies across Microsoft 365 services <br/>- View security threats and alerts <br/>- View reports  |


> [!TIP]
> To learn more about roles in Azure Active Directory, see [Assign administrator and non-administrator roles to users with Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal). And, more information about roles for Defender for Endpoint, see [Role-based access control](prepare-deployment.md#role-based-access-control).

## Onboard to Defender for Endpoint

When you're ready to onboard your organization's endpoints, you can choose from several methods, as listed in the following table: <br/><br/>

|Endpoint Operating System | Onboarding methods|
|---|---|
| Windows 10 | [Local script (up to 10 devices)](configure-endpoints-script.md) <br>  [Group Policy](configure-endpoints-gp.md) <br>  [Microsoft Endpoint Manager/ Mobile Device Manager](configure-endpoints-mdm.md) <br> [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](configure-endpoints-sccm.md) <br> [VDI scripts](configure-endpoints-vdi.md)  |
| macOS | [Local scripts](mac-install-manually.md) <br> [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](mac-install-with-intune.md) <br> [JAMF Pro](mac-install-with-jamf.md) <br> [Mobile Device Management](mac-install-with-other-mdm.md) |
| iOS |[App-based](ios-install.md) |
| Android | [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](android-intune.md) |

Then, proceed to configure your next-generation protection and attack surface reduction capabilities.

## Configure next-generation protection

We recommend using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](/mem) to manage your organization's devices and security settings, as shown in the following image:
 
:::image type="content" source="../../media/mde-p1/endpoint-policies.png" alt-text="Endpoint security policies in the Micorosft Endpoint Manager portal" lightbox="../../media/mde-p1/endpoint-policies.png":::

To configure your next-generation protection in Microsoft Endpoint Manager, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. Select **Endpoint security** > **Antivirus**, and then select an existing policy. (If you don't have an existing policy, create a new policy.)

3. Set or change your antivirus configuration settings. Need help? Refer to the following resources: <br/>

   - [Settings for Windows 10 Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows)
   - [Configure Defender for Endpoint on iOS features](ios-configure-features.md)

4. When you are finished specifying your settings, choose **Review + save**.

## Configure your attack surface reduction capabilities

Attack surface reduction is all about reducing the places and ways your organization is open to attack. Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 includes several features and capabilities to help you reduce your attack surfaces across your endpoints. These features and capabilities are listed in the following table: <br/><br/>

| Feature/capability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Attack surface reduction rules](#attack-surface-reduction-rules) | Configure attack surface reduction rules to constrain software-based risky behaviors and help keep your organization safe. Attack surface reduction rules target certain software behaviors, such as<br/>- Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files <br/>- Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts <br/>- Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work <br/><br/>Such software behaviors are sometimes seen in legitimate applications. However, these behaviors are often considered risky because they are commonly abused by attackers through malware.  |
| [Ransomware mitigation](#ransomware-mitigation) | Set up ransomware mitigation by configuring controlled folder access, which helps protect your organization's valuable data from malicious apps and threats, such as ransomware. | 
| [Device control](#device-control) | Configure device control settings for your organization to allow or block removable devices (such as USB drives). | 
| [Network protection](#network-protection) | Set up network protection to prevent people in your organization from using applications that access dangerous domains or malicious content on the Internet. |
| [Web protection](#web-protection) | Set up web threat protection to protect your organization's devices from phishing sites, exploit sites, and other untrusted or low-reputation sites. Set up web content filtering to track and regulate access to websites based on their content categories (such as Leisure, High bandwidth, Adult content, or Legal liability). |
| [Network firewall](#network-firewall) | Configure your network firewall with rules that determine which network traffic is permitted to come into or go out from your organization's devices. |
| [Application control](#application-control)  | Configure application control rules if you want to allow only trusted applications and processes to run on your Windows devices.    |

   - **Turn on Microsoft Defender Firewall for public networks**
   
   Review the list of settings under each of domain networks, private networks, and public networks. You can leave them set to **Not configured**, or change them to suit your organization's needs.

   Then choose **Next**.

7. On the **Scope tags** tab, if your organization is using scope tags, choose **+ Select scope tags**, and then select the tags you want to use. Then, choose **Next**. 
   
   To learn more about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags).

8. On the **Assignments** tab, select **Add all users** and **+ Add all devices**, and then choose **Next**. (You can alternately specify specific groups of users or devices.)

9. On the **Review + create** tab, review your policy settings, and then choose **Create**.

> [!TIP]
> Firewall settings are detailed and can seem complex. Refer to [Best practices for configuring Windows Defender Firewall](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/best-practices-configuring).

### Application control

Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) helps protect your Windows endpoints by only allowing trusted applications and processes to run. Most organizations used a phased deployment of WDAC. That is, most organizations don't roll out WDAC across all Windows endpoints at first. In fact, depending on whether your organization's Windows endpoints are fully managed, lightly managed, or "Bring Your Own Device" endpoints, you might deploy WDAC on all or some endpoints.

To help with planning your WDAC deployment, see the following resources:

- [Application Control for Windows](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control)

- [Windows Defender Application Control policy design decisions](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/understand-windows-defender-application-control-policy-design-decisions)

- [Windows Defender Application Control deployment in different scenarios: types of devices](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/types-of-devices)

## Next steps

Now that you have gone through the setup and configuration process, your next step is to get started using Defender for Endpoint.
