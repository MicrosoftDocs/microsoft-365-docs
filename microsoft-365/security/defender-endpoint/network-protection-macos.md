# Network protection for macOS

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Overview

Microsoft is bringing Network protection functionality to macOS (min. macOS 11).

Microsoft Network protection helps reduce the attack surface of your devices from Internet-based events. It prevents employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host:

- phishing scams
- exploits
- other malicious content on the Internet

Network protection expands the scope of Microsoft 365 Defender [SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview.md) to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources. The blocks on outbound HTTP(s) traffic are based on the domain or hostname.

## New and updated capabilities

- You can run your corporate VPN in tandem or "side by side" with network protection. Currently, no VPN conflicts are identified. If you do experience conflicts, you can provide feedback through the feedback channel listed at the bottom of this page.
  - Web content filtering is supported with network protection for macOS.
  - If network protection is configured and active on the device, web content filtering (WCF) policies created in the MDEP Portal are respected in browsers, including Chromium Microsoft Edge for macOS. Web content filtering in Microsoft Edge on Mac currently requires network protection; other E5 feature, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications or Custom Indicators currently also require network protection.

### Known issues

- Block/Warn UX isn't customizable and might require other look and feel changes
  - Customer feedback is being collected to drive further design improvements

### Important notes

- We don't recommend controlling network protection from System Preferences by using the Disconnect button. Instead, use the mdatp command-line tool or JAMF / Intune to control network protection for macOS.
- To evaluate effectiveness of macOS web threat protection, we recommend trying it in browsers other than Microsoft Edge for macOS (for example, Safari). Microsoft Edge for macOS has built-in web threat protection that is enabled regardless of whether the Mac network protection feature you're evaluating, is turned on or not.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Microsoft Edge for macOS does not currently support web content filtering, custom indicators, or other enterprise features. However, network protection will provide this protection to Microsoft Edge for macOS as well if network protection is enabled.

## Prerequisites

- Licensing: Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint tenant (can be trial)
- Onboarded Machines:
  - Minimum macOS version: 11
  - Product version 101.78.13 or later
  - Your device must be in either the External (Preview) or InsiderFast (Beta) Microsoft AutoUpdate update channel. You can check the update channel using the following command:

```bash
mdatp health --field release_ring
```

If your device isn't already in the External(Preview) update channel, execute the following command from the Terminal. The channel update takes effect next time the product starts (when the next product update is installed or when the device is rebooted).

```bash
defaults write com.microsoft.autoupdate2 ChannelName -string Preview
```

Alternatively, if you are in a managed environment (JAMF or Intune), you can configure the device group remotely. For more information, see [Set preferences for Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint on macOS](mac-preferences.md).

## Deployment instructions

### Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint

After you've configured your device to be in the External(preview) update channel, install the most recent product version through Microsoft AutoUpdate. To open Microsoft AutoUpdate, run the following command from the Terminal:

```bash
open /Library/Application\ Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0/Microsoft\ AutoUpdate.app
```

Configure the product with your organization information using the instructions in our public documentation.

Network protection is disabled by default, but it can be configured to run in one of the following modes (also called enforcement levels):

- **Audit**: useful to make sure it doesn't affect line-of-business apps, or get an idea of how often blocks occur
- **Block**: network protection prevents connection to malicious websites
- **Disabled**: all components associated with network protection are disabled

You can deploy this feature in one of the following ways: manually, through JAMF, or through Intune. The following sections describe each of these methods in detail.

#### Manual deployment

To configure the enforcement level, run the following command from the Terminal:

```bash
mdatp config network-protection enforcement-level --value [enforcement-level]
```

For example, to configure network protection to run in blocking mode, execute the following command:

```bash
mdatp config network-protection enforcement-level --value block
```

To confirm that network protection has been started successfully, run the following command from the Terminal, and verify that it prints "started":

```bash
mdatp health --field network_protection_status
```

#### JAMF deployment

A successful JAMF deployment requires a configuration profile to set the enforcement level of network protection.
After you create this configuration profile, assign it to the devices where you want to enable network protection.

##### Configure the enforcement level

Note: If you've already configured Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint on Mac using the instructions listed here, then update the plist file you previously deployed with the content listed below and redeploy it from JAMF.

## How to explore the features

1. Learn how to [Protect your organization against web threats](web-threat-protection.md) using web threat protection.
   - Web threat protection is part of web protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It uses network protection to secure your devices against web threats.
2. Run through the [Custom Indicators of Compromise](indicator-ip-domain.md) flow to get blocks on the Custom Indicator type.
3. Explore [Web content filtering](web-content-filtering.md).
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are removing a policy or changing device groups at the same time, this might cause a delay in policy deployment.
   > Pro tip: You can deploy a policy without selecting any category on a device group. This action will create an audit only policy, to help you understand user behavior before creating a block policy.
   >
   > Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.

4. [Integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/mde-integration) and your network protection-enabled macOS devices will have endpoint policy enforcement capabilities.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Discovery and other features are currently not supported on these platforms.

## Scenarios

The following scenarios are supported during public preview:

### Web threat protection

Web threat protection is part of web protection in Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint. It uses network protection to secure your devices against web threats. By integrating with Microsoft Edge for macOS and popular third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox, web threat protection stops web threats without a web proxy. Web threat protection can protect devices while they're on premises or away. Web threat protection stops access to the following types of sites:

- phishing sites
- malware vectors
- exploit sites
- untrusted or low-reputation sites
- sites you've blocked in your custom indicator list

:::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-reports-web-protection.png" alt-text="Web Protection reports web threat detections." lightbox="images/network-protection-reports-web-protection.png":::

For more information, see [Protect your organization against web threat](web-threat-protection.md)

### Custom Indicators of Compromise

Indicator of compromise (IoCs) matching is an essential feature in every endpoint protection solution. This capability gives SecOps the ability to set a list of indicators for detection and for blocking (prevention and response).

Create indicators that define the detection, prevention, and exclusion of entities. You can define the action to be taken as well as the duration for when to apply the action and the scope of the device group to apply it to.

Currently supported sources are the cloud detection engine of Defender for Endpoint, the automated investigation and remediation engine, and the endpoint prevention engine (Microsoft Defender Antivirus).

:::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-add-url-domain-indicator.png" alt-text="Shows network protection add url or domain indicator." lightbox="images/network-protection-add-url-domain-indicator.png":::

For more information, see: [Create indicators for IPs and URLs/domains](indicator-ip-domain.md).

### Web content filtering

Web content filtering is part of the [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Business. Web content filtering enables your organization to track and regulate access to websites based on their content categories. Many of these websites (even if they're not malicious) might be problematic because of compliance regulations, bandwidth usage, or other concerns.

Configure policies across your device groups to block certain categories. Blocking a category prevents users within specified device groups from accessing URLs associated with the category. For any category that's not blocked, the URLs are automatically audited. Your users can access the URLs without disruption, and you'll gather access statistics to help create a more custom policy decision. Your users will see a block notification if an element on the page they're viewing is making calls to a blocked resource.

Web content filtering is available on the major web browsers, with blocks performed by Network Protection (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Opera). For more information about browser support, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

:::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-wcf-add-policy.png" alt-text="Shows network protection web content filtering add policy." lightbox="images/network-protection-wcf-add-policy.png":::

For more information about reporting, see [Web content filtering](web-content-filtering.md).

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications / Cloud App Catalog identifies apps you would want end users to be warned upon accessing with Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint, and mark them as _Monitored_. The domains listed under monitored apps would be later synced to Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint:

:::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-macos-mcas-monitored-apps.png" alt-text="Shows network protection monitored apps.":::

Within 10-15 minutes, these domains will be listed in Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint Security Center under Indicators > URLs/Domains with Action=Warn. Within the enforcement SLA (see details at the end of this article), end users will be getting warn messages when attempting to access these domains:

:::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-macos-indicators-urls-domains-warn.png" alt-text="Shows network protection indicators for urls or domains warning.":::

When the end user will be attempting to access monitored domains, they'll be warned by Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint.

- The user will get a plain block experience accompanied by the following toast message, which will be displayed by the operating system including the name of the blocked application (e.g Blogger.com)

  :::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-macos-content-blocked.png" alt-text="Shows end-user network protection content blocked toast notification.":::

If the end user encounters a _block_, the user will have two possible resolutions:

#### User bypass

- **For toast message experience**: Press the Unblock button. By reloading the webpage, the user will be able to proceed and use the cloud app. (This action is applicable for the next 24 hours, after which the user will have to unblock once again)

#### User education

- **For toast message experience**: Press the toast message itself. End user will be redirected to a custom redirect URL set globally in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications (More information at the bottom of this page)

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking bypasses per app** – You can track how many users have bypassed the warning in the _Application_ page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications.

  :::image type="content" source="images/network-protection-macos-mcas-cloud-app-security.png" alt-text="Shows network protection cloud app security overview.":::

## Appendix

### End user education center SharePoint site template

For many organizations, it's important to take the cloud controls provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications, and to not only set limitations on end users when needed, but to also educate and coach them about:

- the specific incident
- why it has happened
- what is the thinking behind this decision
- how encountering block sites can be mitigated

Upon facing an unexpected behavior, users' confusion may be reduced by providing them as much information as possible, not only to explain about what has happened but to also educate them to be more aware the next time they choose a cloud app to complete their job. For example, this information can include:

- Organization security and compliance policies and guidelines for internet and cloud use
- Approved/recommended cloud apps for use
- Restricted/blocked cloud apps for use

For this page, we recommend that your organization uses a basic SharePoint site.

### Important things to know

1. It can take up to two hours (typically less) for app domains to propagate and to be update in the endpoint devices, after it's marked as _Monitored_.
2. By default, action will be taken for all apps and domains that were marked as Monitored in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications portal for all the onboarded endpoints in the organization.
3. Full URLs are currently not supported and won't be sent from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications to Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint, if any full URLs are listed under Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications monitored apps, hence, user won't get warned on access attempt (for example, google.com/drive isn't supported, while drive.google.com is supported).

No End-user notification on third party browsers? Check your toast message settings
