## Create roles and assign the role to an Azure Active Directory group

The following steps guide you on how to create roles in Microsoft 365 Defender. It assumes that you have already created Azure Active Directory user groups.

1. Log in to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender</a> using account with a Security administrator or Global administrator role assigned.

2. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Endpoints** \> **Roles** (under **Permissions**).

3. Select **Add item**.

4. Enter the role name, description, and permissions you'd like to assign to the role.

5. Select **Next** to assign the role to an Azure AD Security group.

6. Use the filter to select the Azure AD group that you'd like to add to this role to.

7. **Save and close**.

8. Apply the configuration settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After creating roles, you'll need to create a device group and provide access to the device group by assigning it to a role that you just created.

> [!NOTE]
> Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
