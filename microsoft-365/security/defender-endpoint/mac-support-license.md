## No license found

While you are going through [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md) and [Manual deployment](mac-install-manually.md) testing or a Proof Of Concept (PoC), you might get the following error:

:::image type="content" source="images/no-license-found.png" alt-text="License error" lightbox="images/no-license-found.png":::

### Message:

No license found

Looks like your organization does not have a license for Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription.

Contact your administrator for help.

### Cause:

You deployed and/or installed the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS package ("Download installation package"), but you might not have run the configuration script ("Download onboarding package"), or you have not assigned a license to the user.

You can also encounter this error when the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS agent isn't up to date. 

### Solution:

Follow the MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.py instructions documented here:
[Client configuration](mac-install-manually.md#client-configuration).

For scenarios where Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS isn't up to date, you'll need to update the agent.

## Sign in with your Microsoft account

### Message:

Sign in with your Microsoft account to get started.

Create new account or Switch to enterprise app

### Cause:

You downloaded and installed [Microsoft Defender for individuals on macOS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals) on top of previously installed Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### Solution:

Click **Switch to enterprise app** to switch to Enterprise experience.

You can also suppress switching to experience for Individuals on MDM enrolled machines by including **userInterface**/**consumerExperience** into Defender's settings:

```json
<key>userInterface</key>
<dict>
    <key>consumerExperience</key>
    <string>disabled</string>
</dict>
```
