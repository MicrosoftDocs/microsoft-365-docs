The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent depends on Microsoft Defender Antivirus for some capabilities such as file scanning.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Defender for Endpoint does not adhere to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus Exclusions settings.

You must configure Security intelligence updates on the Defender for Endpoint devices whether Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the active anti-malware or not. For more information, see [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md).

If an onboarded device is protected by a third-party anti-malware client, Microsoft Defender Antivirus on that endpoint will enter into passive mode.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus will continue to receive updates, and the *mspeng.exe* process will be listed as a running a service. But, it won't perform scans and doesn't replace the running third-party anti-malware client.

The Microsoft Defender Antivirus interface will be disabled. Users on the device won't be able to use Microsoft Defender Antivirus to perform on-demand scans or configure most options.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Defender for Endpoint compatibility topic](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).
