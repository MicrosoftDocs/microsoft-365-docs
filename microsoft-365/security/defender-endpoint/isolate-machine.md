## API description

Isolates a device from accessing external network.

## Limitations

1. Rate limitations for this API are 100 calls per minute and 1500 calls per hour.

[!include[Device actions note](../../includes/machineactionsnote.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Full isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1703, and on Windows 11.
> - Selective isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1709 or later, and on Windows 11.
> - When isolating a device, only certain processes and destinations are allowed. Therefore, devices that are behind a full VPN tunnel won't be able to reach the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud service after the device is isolated. We recommend using a split-tunneling VPN for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud-based protection-related traffic.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs](apis-intro.md)

Permission type|Permission|Permission display name
:---|:---|:---
Application|Machine.Isolate|'Isolate machine'
Delegated (work or school account)|Machine.Isolate|'Isolate machine'

> [!NOTE]
> When obtaining a token using user credentials:
>
> - The user needs to have at least the following role permission: 'Active remediation actions' (See [Create and manage roles](user-roles.md) for more information)
> - The user needs to have access to the device, based on device group settings (See [Create and manage device groups](machine-groups.md) for more information)
>
> Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
