>[!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4wDob]

Defender for Endpoint uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.


-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, device-learning, and
    unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem,
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams,
    and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat
    intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they
    are observed in collected sensor data.
