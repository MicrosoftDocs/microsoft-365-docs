Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android and iOS is our **mobile threat defense solution (MTD)**. Typically, companies are proactive in protecting PCs from vulnerabilities and attack while mobile devices often go unmonitored and unprotected. Where mobile platforms have built-in protection such as app isolation and vetted consumer app stores, these platforms remain vulnerable to web-based or other sophisticated attacks. As more employees use devices for work and to access sensitive information, it is imperative that companies deploy an MTD solution to protect devices and your resources from increasingly sophisticated attacks on mobiles.

### End-user onboarding

- [Configure Zero-touch onboard for iOS enrolled devices](ios-install.md#zero-touch-silent-onboarding-of-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint): Admins can configure zero-touch install to silently onboard Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on enrolled iOS devices without requiring the user to open the app. 

- [Configure Conditional Access to enforce user onboarding](android-configure.md#conditional-access-with-defender-for-endpoint-on-android): This can be applied to ensure end-users onboard to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app after deploying. Watch this video for a quick demo on configuring conditional access with Defender for Endpoint risk signals.

## Pilot evaluation

While evaluating mobile threat defense with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you can verify that certain criteria is met before proceeding to deploy the service to a larger set of devices. You can define the exit criteria and ensure that they are satisfied before deploying widely.

This helps reduce potential issues that could arise while rolling out the service. Here are some tests and exit criteria that might help:

- Devices show up in the device inventory list: After successful onboarding of Defender for Endpoint on the mobile device, verify that the device is listed in the Device Inventory in the [security console](https://security.microsoft.com).

- Run a malware detection test on an Android device: Install any test virus app from the Google play store and verify that it gets detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Here is an example app that can be used for this test: [Test virus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antivirus&hl=en_US&gl=US). Note that on Android Enterprise with a work profile, only the work profile is supported.

- Run a phishing test: Browse to https://smartscreentestratings2.net and verify that it gets blocked by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Note that on Android Enterprise with a work profile, only the work profile is supported.

- Alerts appear in dashboard: Verify that alerts for above detection tests appear on the [security console](https://security.microsoft.com).
