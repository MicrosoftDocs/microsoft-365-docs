	<summary> April-2023 (Build: 101.98.58 | Release version: 30.123022.19858.0)</summary>

&ensp;Released: **April 20,2023**<br/>
&ensp;Published: **April 20, 2023**<br/>
&ensp;Build: **101.98.58**<br/>
&ensp;Release version: **30.123022.19858.0**<br/>
&ensp;Engine version: **1.1.20000.2**<br/>
&ensp;Signature version: **1.381.3067.0**<br/>

**What's new**

- There are multiple fixes and new changes in this release 
	- Logging and error reporting improvements for auditd.
	- Handle failure in reload of auditd configuration.
	- Handling for empty auditd rule files during MDE install.
	- Engine Update to 1.1.20000.2 and Signatures Ver: 1.381.3067.0.
	- Addressed a health issue in mdatp which occur due to selinux denials.
	- Bug fixes.
	
**Known issues**

- While upgrading mdatp to version 101.94.13 or later, you may notice that health is false, with health_issues as "no active supplementary event provider". This may happen due to misconfigured/conflicting auditd rules on existing machines. To mitigate the issue, the auditd rules on the existing machines need to be fixed. The following steps can help you to identify such auditd rules (these commands need to be run as super user). Please take backup of following file: /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules as these steps are only to identify failures.

```bash
echo -c >> /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
augenrules --load
```

- While upgrading from mdatp version 101.75.43 or 101.78.13, you may encounter a kernel hang. Run the following commands before attempting to upgrade to version 101.98.05. More information about the underlying issue can be found at [System hang due to blocked tasks in fanotify code](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2838901).

There are two ways to mitigate this upgrade issue:

Use your package manager to uninstall the 101.75.43 or 101.78.13 mdatp version.
Example:
```bash
sudo apt purge mdatp
sudo apt-get install mdatp
```
	
As an alternative you can follow the instructions to [uninstall](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-resources#uninstall), then [install](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-install-manually#application-installation) the latest version of the package.

If you don't want to uninstall mdatp you can disable rtp and mdatp in sequence before upgrading. 
Caution: Some customers(<1%) are experiencing issues with this method. 

 ```bash
sudo mdatp config real-time-protection --value=disabled
sudo systemctl disable mdatp
```

	<summary> March-2023 (Build: 101.98.30 | Release version: 30.123012.19830.0)</summary>

## March-2023 Build: 101.98.30 | Release version: 30.123012.19830.0

&ensp;Released: **March , 20,2023**<br/>
&ensp;Published: **March 20, 2023**<br/>
&ensp;Build: **101.98.30**<br/>
&ensp;Release version: **30.123012.19830.0**<br/>
&ensp;Engine version: **1.1.19900.2**<br/>
&ensp;Signature version: **1.379.1299.0**<br/>
**What's new**
- This new release is build over March 2023 release (101.98.05) with fix for Live response commands failing for one of our customers. There is no change for other customers and upgrade is optional. 
	
**Known issues**

- With mdatp version 101.98.30 you might see a health false issue in some of the cases, because SELinux rules are not defined for certain scenarios. The health warning could look something like this:

*found SELinux denials within last one day. If the MDATP is recently installed, please clear the existing audit logs or wait for a day for this issue to auto-resolve. Please use command: \"sudo ausearch -i -c 'mdatp_audisp_pl' | grep \"type=AVC\" | grep \" denied\" to find details*

The issue could be mitigated by running the following commands.

```
sudo ausearch -c 'mdatp_audisp_pl' --raw | sudo audit2allow -M my-mdatpaudisppl_v1
sudo semodule -i my-mdatpaudisppl_v1.pp
```

Here my-mdatpaudisppl_v1 represents the policy module name. After running the commands, either wait for 24 hours or clear/archive the audit logs. The audit logs could be archived by running the following command

```
sudo service auditd stop
sudo systemctl stop mdatp
cd /var/log/audit
sudo gzip audit.*
sudo service auditd start
sudo systemctl start mdatp
mdatp health
```

In case the issue reappears with some different denials. We need to run the mitigation again with a different module name(eg my-mdatpaudisppl_v2).

&ensp;Engine version: **1.1.19300.3**<br/>
&ensp;Signature version: **1.369.395.0**<br/>

**What's new**

- Fixes a kernel hang observed on select customer workloads running mdatp version 101.75.43. After RCA this was attributed to a race condition while releasing the ownership of a sensor file descriptor. The race condition was exposed due to a recent product change in the shutdown path. Customers on newer Kernel versions (5.1+) are not impacted by this issue. More information about the underlying issue can be found at [System hang due to blocked tasks in fanotify code](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2838901).

**Known issues**

- When upgrading from mdatp version 101.75.43 or 101.78.13, you might encounter a kernel hang. Run the following commands before attempting to upgrade to version 101.80.97. This should prevent the issue from occurring.

```
sudo mdatp config real-time-protection --value=disabled
sudo systemctl disable mdatp
```

After executing the above, use your package manager to perform the upgrade.

As an alternative to the above, you can follow the instructions to [uninstall](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-resources#uninstall), then [install](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-install-manually#application-installation) the latest version of the package.
