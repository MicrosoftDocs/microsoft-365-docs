## API description

Provides methods and property details about the APIs that pull vulnerability management data on a per-device basis. There are different API calls to get different types of data. In general, each API call contains the requisite data for devices in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless indicated otherwise, all export assessment methods listed are **_full export_** and **_by device_** (also referred to as **_per device_**).

You can use the export assessment APIs to retrieve (export) different types of information:

- [1. Export secure configurations assessment](#1-export-secure-configurations-assessment)
- [2. Export software inventory assessment](#2-export-software-inventory-assessment)
- [3. Export software vulnerabilities assessment](#3-export-software-vulnerabilities-assessment)
- [4. Export non product code software inventory assessment](#4-export-non-product-code-software-inventory-assessment)

The APIs that correspond to the export information types are described in sections 1, 2, and 3.

Each method has different API calls to get different types of data. Because the amount of data can be large, there are two ways it can be retrieved:

- **JSON response**  The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for _small organizations with less than 100-K devices_. The response is paginated, so you can use the \@odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.

- **via files** This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows:
  - Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.
  - Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.

Data that is collected using either '_JSON response_ or _via files_' is the current snapshot of the current state. It doesn't contain historic data. To collect historic data, customers must save the data in their own data storages.

## 1. Export secure configurations assessment

Returns all of the configurations and their status, on a per-device basis.

### 1.1 Methods

The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for small organizations with less than 100-K devices. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.
Export secure configuration assessment **(via files)**|Secure configuration by device collection. See: [1.3 Properties (via files)](#13-properties-via-files)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, ConfigurationId. This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows: <ol><li>Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.</li><li>Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.</li></ol>

## 3. Export software vulnerabilities assessment

Returns all the known vulnerabilities on a device and their details, for all devices.

### 3.1 Methods

Method|Data type|Description
:---|:---|:---
Export software vulnerabilities assessment **(JSON response)**|Investigation collection See: [3.2 Properties (JSON response)](#32-properties-json-response)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId. The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for small organizations with less than 100-K devices. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.
Export software vulnerabilities assessment **(via files)**|Investigation entity See: [3.3 Properties (via files)](#33-properties-via-files)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId. This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows: <ol><li>Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.</li><li>Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.</li></ol>
**Delta export** software vulnerabilities assessment **(JSON response)**|Investigation collection See: [3.4 Properties Delta export (JSON response)](#34-properties-delta-export-json-response)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of: DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId, and EventTimestamp. <p> The API pulls data in your organization as JSON responses. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results. The full software vulnerabilities assessment (JSON response) is used to obtain an entire snapshot of the software vulnerabilities assessment of your organization by device. However, the delta export API call is used to fetch only the changes that have happened between a selected date and the current date (the "delta" API call). Instead of getting a full export with a large amount of data every time, you'll only get specific information on new, fixed, and updated vulnerabilities. Delta export API call can also be used to calculate different KPIs such as "how many vulnerabilities were fixed?" or "how many new vulnerabilities were added to my organization?" <p> Because the Delta export API call for software vulnerabilities returns data for only a targeted date range, it isn't considered a _full export_.
