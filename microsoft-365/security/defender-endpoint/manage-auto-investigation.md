# Review remediation actions following an automated investigation

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


## Remediation actions

When an [automated investigation](automated-investigations.md) runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts can be *Malicious*, *Suspicious*, or *No threats found*.

Depending on

- the type of threat,
- the resulting verdict, and
- how your organization's [device groups](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups) are configured,

remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by your organization's security operations team.

Here are a few examples:

- **Example 1**: Fabrikam's device groups are set to **Full - remediate threats automatically** (the recommended setting). In this case, remediation actions are taken automatically for artifacts that are considered to be malicious following an automated investigation (see [Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions)).

- **Example 2**: Contoso's devices are included in a device group that is set for **Semi - require approval for any remediation**. In this case, Contoso's security operations team must review and approve all remediation actions following an automated investigation (see [Review pending actions](#review-pending-actions)).

- **Example 3**: Tailspin Toys has their device groups set to **No automated response** (not recommended). In this case, automated investigations do not occur. No remediation actions are taken or pending, and no actions are logged in the [Action center](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center#the-action-center) for their devices (see [Manage device groups](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups#manage-device-groups)).

Whether taken automatically or upon approval, an automated investigation can result in one or more of the remediation actions:

- Quarantine a file
- Remove a registry key
- Kill a process
- Stop a service
- Disable a driver
- Remove a scheduled task

## Review pending actions

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 security center ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**.
3. Review the items on the **Pending** tab.
4. Select an action to open its flyout pane.
5. In the flyout pane, review the information, and then take one of the following steps:
   - Select **Open investigation page** to view more details about the investigation.
   - Select **Approve** to initiate a pending action.
   - Select **Reject** to prevent a pending action from being taken.
   - Select **Go hunt** to go into [Advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md).

## Review completed actions

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 security center ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**.
3. Review the items on the **History** tab.
4. Select an item to view more details about that remediation action.

## Undo completed actions

If you've determined that a device or a file is not a threat, you can undo remediation actions that were taken, whether those actions were taken automatically or manually. In the Action center, on the **History** tab, you can undo any of the following actions:

<br>

****

|Action source|Supported Actions|
|---|---|
|<ul><li>Automated investigation</li><li>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</li><li>Manual response actions</li></ul>|<ul><li>Isolate device</li><li>Restrict code execution</li><li>Quarantine a file</li><li>Remove a registry key</li><li>Stop a service</li><li>Disable a driver</li><li>Remove a scheduled task</li></ul>|
|

### To undo multiple actions at one time

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.
2. On the **History** tab, select the actions that you want to undo. Make sure to select items that have the same Action type. A flyout pane opens.
3. In the flyout pane, select **Undo**.

### To remove a file from quarantine across multiple devices

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.
2. On the **History** tab, select an item that has the Action type **Quarantine file**.
3. In the flyout pane, select **Apply to X more instances of this file**, and then select **Undo**.

## Automation levels, automated investigation results, and resulting actions

Automation levels affect whether certain remediation actions are taken automatically or only upon approval. Sometimes your security operations team has more steps to take, depending on the results of an automated investigation. The following table summarizes automation levels, results of automated investigations, and what to do in each case.

<br>

****

|Device group setting|Automated investigation results|What to do|
|---|---|---|
|**Full - remediate threats automatically** (the recommended setting)|A verdict of *Malicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> Appropriate remediation actions are taken automatically.|[Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions)|
|**Full - remediate threats automatically**|A verdict of *Suspicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> Remediation actions are pending approval to proceed.|[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions)|
|**Semi - require approval for any remediation**|A verdict of either *Malicious* or *Suspicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> Remediation actions are pending approval to proceed.|[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions)|
|**Semi - require approval for core folders remediation**|A verdict of *Malicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> If the artifact is a file or executable and is in an operating system directory, such as the Windows folder or the Program files folder, then remediation actions are pending approval. <p> If the artifact is *not* in an operating system directory, remediation actions are taken automatically.|<ol><li>[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions)</li><li>[Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions)</li></ol>|
|**Semi - require approval for core folders remediation**|A verdict of *Suspicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> Remediation actions are pending approval.|[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions).|
|**Semi - require approval for non-temp folders remediation**|A verdict of *Malicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> If the artifact is a file or executable that is not in a temporary folder, such as the user's downloads folder or temp folder, remediation actions are pending approval. <p> If the artifact is a file or executable that *is* in a temporary folder, remediation actions are taken automatically.|<ol><li>[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions)</li><li>[Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions)</li></ol>|
|**Semi - require approval for non-temp folders remediation**|A verdict of *Suspicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> Remediation actions are pending approval.|[Approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions)|
|Any of the **Full** or **Semi** automation levels|A verdict of *No threats found* is reached for a piece of evidence. <p> No remediation actions are taken, and no actions are pending approval.|[View details and results of automated investigations](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center)|
|**No automated response** (not recommended)|No automated investigations run, so no verdicts are reached, and no remediation actions are taken or awaiting approval.|[Consider setting up or changing your device groups to use **Full** or **Semi** automation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups)|
|

In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, all verdicts are tracked in the [Action center](auto-investigation-action-center.md#new-a-unified-action-center).
