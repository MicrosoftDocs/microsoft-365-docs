Attack surfaces are all the places where your organization is vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks. Defender for Endpoint includes several capabilities to help reduce your attack surfaces. Watch the following video to learn more about attack surface reduction.

## Configure attack surface reduction capabilities

To configure attack surface reduction in your environment, follow these steps:

1. [Enable hardware-based isolation for Microsoft Edge](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/install-md-app-guard).

2. [Enable attack surface reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment.md).

3. Enable application control.

   1. Review base policies in Windows. See [Example Base Policies](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/example-wdac-base-policies).

   2. See the [Windows Defender Application Control design guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-design-guide).

   3. Refer to [Deploying Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-deployment-guide).

4. [Enable controlled folder access](enable-controlled-folders.md).

5. Enable [removable storage protection](device-control-overview.md).

6. [Turn on network protection](enable-network-protection.md).

7. Enable [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md).

8. [Enable exploit protection](enable-exploit-protection.md).

9. Set up your network firewall.

   1. Get an overview of [Windows Firewall with advanced security](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security).

   2. Use the [Windows Firewall design guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design-guide) to decide how you want to design your firewall policies.

   3. Use the [Windows Firewall deployment guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-guide) to set up your organization's firewall with advanced security.

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, when you configure attack surface reduction capabilities, you can choose from among several methods:
>
> - Microsoft Intune
> - Microsoft Configuration Manager
> - Group Policy
> - PowerShell cmdlets

## Test attack surface reduction in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

As part of your organization's security team, you can configure attack surface reduction capabilities to run in audit mode to see how they work. You can enable the following attack surface reduction security features in audit mode:

- Attack surface reduction rules
- Exploit protection
- Network protection
- Controlled folder access
- Device control

Audit mode lets you see a record of what *would* have happened if the feature were enabled.

You can enable audit mode when testing how the features work. Enabling audit mode only for testing helps to prevent audit mode from affecting your line-of-business apps. You can also get an idea of how many suspicious file modification attempts occur over a certain period of time.

The features don't block or prevent apps, scripts, or files from being modified. However, the Windows Event Log records events as if the features were fully enabled. With audit mode, you can review the event log to see what effect the feature would have had if it was enabled.

To find the audited entries, go to **Applications and Services** \> **Microsoft** \> **Windows** \> **Windows Defender** \> **Operational**.

Use Defender for Endpoint to get greater details for each event. These details are especially helpful for investigating attack surface reduction rules. Using the Defender for Endpoint console lets you [investigate issues as part of the alert timeline and investigation scenarios](investigate-alerts.md).

You can enable audit mode using Group Policy, PowerShell, and configuration service providers (CSPs).

| Audit options | How to enable audit mode | How to view events |
|---|---|---|
| Audit applies to all events | [Enable controlled folder access](enable-controlled-folders.md) | [Controlled folder access events](evaluate-controlled-folder-access.md#review-controlled-folder-access-events-in-windows-event-viewer) |
| Audit applies to individual rules | [Step 1: Test attack surface reduction rules using Audit mode](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md#step-1-test-attack-surface-reduction-rules-using-audit) | [Step 2: Understand the Attack surface reduction rules reporting page](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md#step-2-understand-the-asr-rules-reporting-page-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal) |
| Audit applies to all events | [Enable network protection](enable-network-protection.md) | [Network protection events](evaluate-network-protection.md#review-network-protection-events-in-windows-event-viewer) |
| Audit applies to individual mitigations | [Enable exploit protection](enable-exploit-protection.md) | [Exploit protection events](exploit-protection.md#review-exploit-protection-events-in-windows-event-viewer) |

For example, you can test attack surface reduction rules in audit mode before you enable them in block mode. Attack surface reduction rules are predefined to harden common, known attack surfaces. There are several methods you can use to implement attack surface reduction rules. The preferred method is documented in the following attack surface reduction rules deployment articles:

- [Attack surface reduction rules deployment overview](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment.md)
- [Plan attack surface reduction rules deployment](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-plan.md)
- [Test attack surface reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md)
- [Enable attack surface reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-implement.md)
- [Operationalize attack surface reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-operationalize.md)

## View attack surface reduction events

Review attack surface reduction events in Event Viewer to monitor what rules or settings are working. You can also determine if any settings are too "noisy" or impacting your day to day workflow.

Reviewing events is handy when you're evaluating the features. You can enable audit mode for features or settings, and then review what would have happened if they were fully enabled.

This section lists all the events, their associated feature or setting, and describes how to create custom views to filter to specific events.

Get detailed reporting into events, blocks, and warnings as part of Windows Security if you have an E5 subscription and use [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md).

### Use custom views to review attack surface reduction capabilities

Create custom views in the Windows Event Viewer to only see events for specific capabilities and settings. The easiest way is to import a custom view as an XML file. You can copy the XML directly from this page.

You can also manually navigate to the event area that corresponds to the feature.

#### Import an existing XML custom view

1. Create an empty .txt file and copy the XML for the custom view you want to use into the .txt file. Do this for each of the custom views you want to use. Rename the files as follows (ensure you change the type from .txt to .xml):

   - Controlled folder access events custom view: *cfa-events.xml*
   - Exploit protection events custom view: *ep-events.xml*
   - Attack surface reduction events custom view: *asr-events.xml*
   - Network/ protection events custom view: *np-events.xml*

2. Type **event viewer** in the Start menu and open **Event Viewer**.

3. Select **Action** \> **Import Custom View...**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Animation highlighting Import custom view on the left of the Even viewer window.](media/events-import.gif)

4. Navigate to where you extracted the XML file for the custom view you want and select it.

5. Select **Open**.

6. It creates a custom view that filters to only show the events related to that feature.

#### Copy the XML directly

1. Type **event viewer** in the Start menu and open the Windows **Event Viewer**.

2. On the left panel, under **Actions**, select **Create Custom View...**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Animation highlighting the create custom view option on the Event viewer window.](media/events-create.gif)

3. Go to the XML tab and select **Edit query manually**. You see a warning that you can't edit the query using the **Filter** tab if you use the XML option. Select **Yes**.

4. Paste the XML code for the feature you want to filter events from into the XML section.

5. Select **OK**. Specify a name for your filter. This action creates a custom view that filters to only show the events related to that feature.
