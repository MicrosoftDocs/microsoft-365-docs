# Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) demonstration

The Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA) protection feature in Microsoft Defender Antivirus can identify and block PUAs from downloading and installing on endpoints in your network. These applications are not considered viruses, malware, or other types of threats, but might perform actions on endpoints that adversely affect their performance or use.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 10, Windows 11

- Enable PUA protection. See the [Detect and block Potentially Unwanted Applications](detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) article for more information.
- You can also [download and use the PowerShell script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsDefender_InternalEvaluationSettings/) to enable this setting and others.

## Scenario

1. Go to [http://www.amtso.org/feature-settings-check-potentially-unwanted-applications/](http://www.amtso.org/feature-settings-check-potentially-unwanted-applications/)
2. Click "Download the Potentially Unwanted Application ‘test’ file" link
3. After downloading the file, it is automatically blocked and prevented from running.
