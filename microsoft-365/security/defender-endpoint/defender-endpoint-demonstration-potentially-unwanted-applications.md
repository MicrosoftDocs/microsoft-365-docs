The Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA) protection feature in Microsoft Defender Antivirus can identify and block PUAs from downloading and installing on endpoints in your network. These applications aren't considered viruses, malware, or other types of threats, but might perform actions on endpoints that adversely affect their performance or use.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 11 or Windows 10
- Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
- Enable PUA protection. For more information, see the [Detect and block Potentially Unwanted Applications](detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) article.
- You can also [download and use the PowerShell script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsDefender_InternalEvaluationSettings/) to enable this setting and others.
