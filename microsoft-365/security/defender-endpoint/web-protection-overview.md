## Web threat protection

The cards that make up web threat protection are **Web threat detections over time** and **Web threat summary**.

Web threat protection includes:
- Comprehensive visibility into web threats affecting your organization
- Investigation capabilities over web-related threat activity through alerts and comprehensive profiles of URLs and the devices that access these URLs
- A full set of security features that track general access trends to malicious and unwanted websites

## Web content filtering

The cards that comprise web content filtering are **Web activity by category**, **Web content filtering summary**, and **Web activity summary**.

Web content filtering includes:
- Users are prevented from accessing websites in blocked categories, whether they are browsing on-premises or away
- You can conveniently deploy varied policies to various sets of users using the device groups defined in the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint role-based access control settings](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/rbac)
- You can access web reports in the same central location, with visibility over actual blocks and web usage
