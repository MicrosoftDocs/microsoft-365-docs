# Migrate from Symantec to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
If you are planning to switch from Symantec Endpoint Protection (Symantec) to [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection) (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint), you're in the right place. Use this article as a guide.

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

When you make the switch from Symantec to Defender for Endpoint, you begin with your Symantec solution in active mode, configure Defender for Endpoint in passive mode, onboard to Defender for Endpoint, and then set Defender for Endpoint to active mode and remove Symantec.

## The migration process

When you switch from Symantec to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you follow a process that can be divided into three phases, as described in the following table:

![Migration phases - prepare, setup, onboard](images/phase-diagrams/migration-phases.png)

|Phase |Description |
|--|--|
|[Prepare for your migration](symantec-to-microsoft-defender-atp-prepare.md) |During the **Prepare** phase, you get Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, plan your roles and permissions, and grant access to the Microsoft Defender Security Center. You also configure your device proxy and internet settings to enable communication between your organization's devices and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. |
|[Set up Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](symantec-to-microsoft-defender-atp-setup.md) |During the **Setup** phase, you configure settings and exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Symantec Endpoint Protection. You also create device groups, collections, and organizational units. Finally, you configure your antimalware policies and real-time protection settings.|
|[Onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](symantec-to-microsoft-defender-atp-onboard.md) |During the **Onboard** phase, you onboard your devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and verify that those devices are communicating with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Last, you uninstall Symantec and make sure protection through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is in active mode. |

## What's included in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?

In this migration guide, we focus on [next-generation protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) and [endpoint detection and response](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/overview-endpoint-detection-response) capabilities as a starting point for moving to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. However, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes much more than antivirus and endpoint protection.
