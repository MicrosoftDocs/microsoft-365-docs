> For Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2 and Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2016 to appear in device health reports, these devices must be onboarded using the modern unified solution package. For more information, see [New functionality in the modern unified solution for Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution).

In the Microsoft 365 Security dashboard navigation panel, select **Reports**, and then open **Device health and compliance**.
The Device health and compliance dashboard is structured in two tabs:

  - [Sensor health card](device-health-sensor-health-os.md#sensor-health-card)
  - [Operating systems and platforms card](device-health-sensor-health-os.md#operating-systems-and-platforms-card)
  - [Windows versions card](device-health-sensor-health-os.md#windows-versions-card)

- The [**Microsoft Defender Antivirus health** tab](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#microsoft-defender-antivirus-health-tab) has eight cards that report on aspects of Microsoft Defender Antivirus:
  - [Antivirus mode card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#antivirus-mode-card)
  - [Antivirus engine version card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#antivirus-engine-version-card)

  - [Antivirus platform version card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#antivirus-platform-version-card)
  - [Recent antivirus scan results card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#recent-antivirus-scan-results-card)
  - [Antivirus engine updates card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#antivirus-engine-updates-card)
  - [Security intelligence updates card](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md#security-intelligence-updates-card)
