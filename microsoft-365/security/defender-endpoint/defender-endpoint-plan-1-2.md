These plans provide advanced threat protection with antivirus and antimalware protection, ransomware mitigation, and more, together with centralized management and reporting.

## Mixed-licensing scenarios

A mixed-licensing scenario is a situation in which an organization is using a mix of subscriptions, such as Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2. The following table describes examples of mixed-licensing scenarios: 

| Scenario | Description |
|:---|:---|
| *Mixed tenant* | Use different sets of capabilities for groups of users and their devices. Examples include:<br/>- Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Defender for Endpoint Plan 2<br/>- Microsoft 365 E3 and Microsoft 365 E5  |
| *Mixed trial* | Try a premium level subscription for some users. Examples include: <br/>- Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (purchased for all users), and Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 (a trial subscription has been started for some users)<br/>- Microsoft 365 E3 (purchased for all users), and Microsoft 365 E5 (a trial subscription has been started for some users) |
| *Phased upgrades* | Upgrade user licenses in phases. Examples include:<br/>- Moving groups of users from Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 to Plan 2<br/>- Moving groups of users from Microsoft 365 E3 to E5  |

**If you have Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2 in your tenant, the ability to manage your subscription settings across client devices is now in preview**! This new capability enables you to:

- Apply *either* Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 *or* Plan 2 settings to all your client devices; or
- Use mixed mode, and apply Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 settings to some client devices, and Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 to other client devices.

You can also use a newly added license usage report to track status. 

**For more information, including how to use mixed-licensing scenarios in your tenant, see [Manage your Defender for Endpoint subscription settings across devices](defender-endpoint-subscription-settings.md)**.
