# Use eBPF-based sensor for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prerelease product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux provides supplementary event data for Linux operating systems. eBPF can be used as an alternative technology to auditd because eBPF helps address several classes of issues seen with the auditd event provider and is beneficial in the areas of performance and system stability.

Key benefits include:

- Reduced system-wide auditd-related log noise
- Optimized system-wide event rules otherwise causing conflict between applications
- Reduced overhead for file event (file read/open) monitoring
- Improved event rate throughput and reduced memory footprint
- Optimized performance for specific configurations

## How eBPF works

With eBPF, events previously obtained from the auditd event provider now flow from the eBPF sensor. This helps with system stability and improving CPU and memory utilization and reduces disk usage. Also, when eBPF is enabled, all auditd-related custom rules are eliminated which help reduce the possibility of conflicts between applications.

In addition, the eBPF sensor uses capabilities of the Linux kernel without requiring the use of a kernel module that helps increase system stability.

> [!NOTE]
> In the preview version eBPF will be used in conjunction with auditd while auditd will be used only for logging data and network protection events and will capture these events without any custom rules and flow them automatically. Be aware that auditd will be removed in future versions.

## System prerequisites

The eBPF sensor for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux is supported on the following minimum distribution and kernel versions:

| **Linux Distribution** | **Distribution version** | **Kernel version** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Ubuntu                 | 16.04                    | 4.15.0             |
| Fedora                 | 33                       | 5.8.15             |
| CentOS                 | 7.6                      | 3.10.0-957         |
| SLES                   | 15                       | 5.3.18-18.47       |
| RHEL                   | 7.6                      | 3.10.0-957         |
| Debian                 | 9.0                      | 4.19.0             |
| Oracle Linux           | 8.0                      | 4.18.0             |

When the eBPF sensor is enabled on an endpoint, Defender for Endpoint on Linux updates supplementary_events_subsystem to ebpf.

## Use eBPF

The eBPF sensor will be automatically turned on and gradually rolled out across all insider machines over the coming days following this publication. You will need Microsoft Defender for Endpoint version 101.23062.0005 or later to experience the most recent improvements using the new sensor.

If you're running a production build and interested in evaluating the eBPF preview functionality, you can use the following mdatp config command (requires privileges):

```bash
sudo mdatp config ebpf-supplementary-event-provider --value [enabled/disabled]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you disable eBPF, the supplementary event provider switches back to auditd.

### Troubleshooting and diagnostics

You can check the agent health status by running the **mdatp** health command. Make sure that the eBPF sensor for Defender for Endpoint on Linux is supported by checking the current kernel version by using the following command line:

```bash
uname -a
``````

The following two sets of data help analyze potential issues and determine the most effective resolution options.

1.  Collect a diagnostic package from the client analyzer tool by using the following instructions:Â [Troubleshoot performance issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-support-perf.md)

2.  Collect a debug diagnostic package when Defender for Endpoint is utilizing high resources by using the following instructions: [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux resources](linux-resources.md#collect-diagnostic-information)

> [!NOTE]
> In the preview version, diagnostic capabilities for top processes consuming eBPF resources and troubleshooting capabilities for configuring eBPF exclusions are not supported. These functionalities will be available in future versions.
