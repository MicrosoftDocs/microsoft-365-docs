## Background execution

Starting with macOS 13, a user must explicitly allow an application to run in background.
macOS will pop a prompt up, telling the user that Microsoft Defender can run in background.

:::image type="content" source="images/background-items-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows background items notification":::

You can view applications permitted to run in background in System Settings => Login Items => Allow in the Background at any time:

:::image type="content" source="images/background-items.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows background items":::

Make sure all Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Corporation items are enabled. If they are disabled then macOS will not start Microsoft Defender after a machine restart.

## Onboarding Package

Once you have installed the MDE on macOS client, you must now onboard the package, which registers to your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant and licenses it.

1. Verify if MDE on macOS has already been onboarded.

   Copy *wdav.pkg* and *MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh* to the device where you have deployed Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

   The client device isn't associated with *org_id*. The *org_id* attribute is blank.

   ```bash
   mdatp health --field org_id
   ```

2. Run the Bash script to install the onboarding package:

   ```bash
   sudo bash -x MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh
   ```

3. Verify that the device is now associated with your organization and reports a valid org ID:

   ```bash
   mdatp health --field org_id
   ```

   After installation, you'll see the Microsoft Defender icon in the macOS status bar in the top-right corner.

4. Run the connectivity test.

   ```bash
   mdatp connectivity test
   ```
