## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, see [the main Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS page](microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements for the current software version.

## Download installation and onboarding packages

Download the installation and onboarding packages from Microsoft 365 Defender portal:

1. In <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, go to **Settings > Endpoints > Device management > Onboarding**.
2. In Section 1 of the page, set operating system to **macOS** and Deployment method to **Local script**.
3. In Section 2 of the page, select **Download installation package**. Save it as wdav.pkg to a local directory.
4. In Section 2 of the page, select **Download onboarding package**. Save it as WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip to the same directory.

## Client configuration

1. Copy wdav.pkg and MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh to the device where you deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

    The client device isn't associated with org_id. Note that the *org_id* attribute is blank.

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

2. Run the Bash script to install the configuration file:

    ```bash
    Sudo bash -x MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh
    ```

3. Verify that the device is now associated with your organization and reports a valid org ID:

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

    After installation, you'll see the Microsoft Defender icon in the macOS status bar in the top-right corner.

## How to Allow Full Disk Access

1. To grant consent, open **System Preferences** \> **Security & Privacy** \> **Privacy** \> **Full Disk Access**. Click the lock icon to make changes (bottom of the dialog box). Select Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

2. Run an AV detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

    1. Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of 1 from running the following command):

        ```bash
        mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
        ```

    1. Open a Terminal window. Copy and execute the following command:

        ```bash
        curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt
        ```

    1. The file should have been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Mac. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

        ```bash
        mdatp threat list
        ```

3. Run an EDR detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

   1. In your browser such as Microsoft Edge for Mac or Safari.

   1. Download MDATP MacOS DIY.zip from https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy and extract.

      You may be prompted:

      > Do you want to allow downloads on "mdatpclientanalyzer.blob.core.windows.net"?<br/>
      > You can change which websites can download files in Websites Preferences.

4. Click **Allow**.

5. Open **Downloads**.

6. You should see **MDATP MacOS DIY**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you double-click, you will get the following message:
   >
   > > **"MDATP MacOS DIY" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verifier.**<br/>
   > > macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.<br/>
   > > **\[Move to Trash\]** **\[Cancel\]**

7. Click **Cancel**.

8. Right-click **MDATP MacOS DIY**, and then click **Open**.

    The system should display the following message:

    > **macOS cannot verify the developer of MDATP MacOS DIY. Are you sure you want to open it?**<br/>
    > By opening this app, you will be overriding system security which can expose your computer and personal information to malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

9. Click **Open**.

    The system should display the following message:

    > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - macOS EDR DIY test file<br/>
    > Corresponding alert will be available in the MDATP portal.

10. Click **Open**.

    In a few minutes an alert named "macOS EDR Test Alert" should be raised.

11. Go to Microsoft 365 Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com/).

12. Go to the Alert Queue.
