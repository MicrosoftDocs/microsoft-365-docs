# Microsoft Defender Antivirus in Windows

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

**Platforms**
- Windows 

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is available in Windows 10 and Windows 11, and in versions of Windows Server.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a major component of your next-generation protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This protection brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices (or endpoints) in your organization. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is built into Windows, and it works with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide protection on your device and in the cloud.

## Compatibility with other antivirus products

If you're using a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware product on your device, you might be able to run Microsoft Defender Antivirus in passive mode alongside the non-Microsoft antivirus solution. It depends on the operating system used and whether your device is onboarded to Defender for Endpoint. To learn more, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).

## Comparing active mode, passive mode, and disabled mode

The following table describes what to expect when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in active mode, passive mode, or disabled.

<br/><br/>

| Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| Active mode | In active mode, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is used as the primary antivirus app on the device. Files are scanned, threats are remediated, and detected threats are listed in your organization's security reports and in your Windows Security app. |
| Passive mode | In passive mode, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not used as the primary antivirus app on the device. Files are scanned, and detected threats are reported, but threats are not remediated by Microsoft Defender Antivirus. <br/><br/> **IMPORTANT**: Microsoft Defender Antivirus can run in passive mode only on endpoints that are onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. See [Requirements for Microsoft Defender Antivirus to run in passive mode](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md#requirements-for-microsoft-defender-antivirus-to-run-in-passive-mode). |
| Disabled or uninstalled | When disabled or uninstalled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not used. Files are not scanned, and threats are not remediated. In general, we do not recommend disabling or uninstalling Microsoft Defender Antivirus. |

To learn more, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).

## Check the state of Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your device

If you want to check the state of Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your device, you can use one of several methods, such as the Windows Security app or Windows PowerShell.

### Use the Windows Security app to check status of Microsoft Defender Antivirus
