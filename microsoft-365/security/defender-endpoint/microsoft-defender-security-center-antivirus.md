# Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the Windows Security app

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

Beginning with Windows 10, version 1703 and later, Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings are viewable in the Windows Security app. See [Windows Security](/windows/security/operating-system-security/system-security/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center) for more information about security features and settings that are built into Windows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disabling the Windows Security app does not disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus or [Windows Defender Firewall](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security). These capabilities are disabled or set to passive mode when non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware software is installed on the device and kept up to date.
> If you do disable the Windows Security app, or configure its associated Group Policy settings to prevent it from starting or running, the Windows Security app might display stale or inaccurate information about any antivirus or firewall products that are installed on the device.It might also prevent Microsoft Defender Antivirus from re-enabling when you uninstall any non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware software.
> Disabling the Windows Security app can significantly lower the level protection of your device and could lead to malware infection.

> [!NOTE]
> If these settings are configured and deployed using Group Policy, the settings described in this section will be greyed-out and unavailable for use on individual endpoints. Changes made through a Group Policy Object must first be deployed to individual endpoints before the setting will be updated in Windows Settings. The [Configure end-user interaction with Microsoft Defender Antivirus](configure-end-user-interaction-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) topic describes how local policy override settings can be configured.
