# Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the Windows Security app

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

In Windows 10, version 1703 and later, the Windows Defender app is part of the Windows Security.

Settings that were previously part of the Windows Defender client and main Windows Settings have been combined and moved to the new app, which is installed by default as part of Windows 10, version 1703.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disabling the Windows Security app service does not disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus or [Windows Defender Firewall](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security). These are disabled automatically when a third-party antivirus or firewall product is installed and kept up to date.
>
> If you do disable the Windows Security app service, or configure its associated Group Policy settings to prevent it from starting or running, the Windows Security app might display stale or inaccurate information about any antivirus or firewall products you have installed on the device.
> It might also prevent Microsoft Defender Antivirus from enabling itself if you have an old or outdated third-party antivirus, or if you uninstall any third-party antivirus products you might have previously installed.
> This will significantly lower the protection of your device and could lead to malware infection.

See the [Windows Security article](/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center) for more information on other Windows security features that can be monitored in the app.

The Windows Security app is a client interface on Windows 10, version 1703 and later. It is not the Microsoft 365 Defender web portal that is used to review and manage [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint).

## Review virus and threat protection settings in the Windows Security app

:::image type="content" source="../../media/wdav-protection-settings-wdsc.png" alt-text="Virus and threat protection settings in Windows Security app.":::

1. Open the Windows Security app by clicking the shield icon in the task bar or searching the start menu for **Windows Security**.

2. Select the **Virus & threat protection** tile (or the shield icon on the left menu bar).

The following sections describe how to perform some of the most common tasks when reviewing or interacting with the threat protection provided by Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the Windows Security app.

> [!NOTE]
> If these settings are configured and deployed using Group Policy, the settings described in this section will be greyed-out and unavailable for use on individual endpoints. Changes made through a Group Policy Object must first be deployed to individual endpoints before the setting will be updated in Windows Settings. The [Configure end-user interaction with Microsoft Defender Antivirus](configure-end-user-interaction-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) topic describes how local policy override settings can be configured.

## Run a scan with the Windows Security app

1. Open the Windows Security app by searching the start menu for **Security**, and then selecting **Windows Security**.

2. Select the **Virus & threat protection** tile (or the shield icon on the left menu bar).

3. Select **Quick scan**. Or, to run a full scan, select **Scan options**, and then select an option, such as **Full scan**.

## Review the security intelligence update version and download the latest updates in the Windows Security app

:::image type="content" source="../../media/wdav-wdsc-defs.png" alt-text="Security intelligence version number.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you switch **Real-time protection** off, it will automatically turn back on after a short delay. This is to ensure you are protected from malware and threats.
    > If you install another antivirus product, Microsoft Defender Antivirus automatically disables itself and is indicated as such in the Windows Security app. A setting will appear that will allow you to enable [limited periodic scanning](limited-periodic-scanning-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

## Add exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the Windows Security app
