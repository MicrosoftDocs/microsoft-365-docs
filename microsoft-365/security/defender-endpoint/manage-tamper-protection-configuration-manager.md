[Tamper protection](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md) helps protect certain [security settings](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md#what-happens-when-tamper-protection-is-turned-on), such as virus and threat protection, from being disabled or changed. If you're part of your organization's security team, and you're using [version 2006 of Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2006), you can manage tamper protection for devices by using a method called *tenant attach*. Tenant attach enables you to sync your on-premises-only Configuration Manager devices into the Intune admin center, and then deliver endpoint security configuration policies to on-premises collections & devices. 

Using Configuration Manager with tenant attach, you can turn tamper protection on (or off) for some or all devices. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When tamper protection is turned on, [tamper-protected settings](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md#what-is-tamper-protection) cannot be changed. To avoid breaking management experiences, including Intune and Configuration Manager, keep in mind that changes to tamper-protected settings might appear to succeed but are actually blocked by tamper protection. Depending on your particular scenario, you have several options available: 
> - If you must make changes to a device and those changes are blocked by tamper protection, use [troubleshooting mode](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-troubleshooting-mode) to temporarily disable tamper protection on the device.
> - Use [Intune](manage-tamper-protection-intune.md) or Configuration Manager to exclude devices from tamper protection.
