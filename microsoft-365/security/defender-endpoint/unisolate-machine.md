## API description

Undo isolation of a device.

## Limitations

1. Rate limitations for this API are 100 calls per minute and 1500 calls per hour.

[!include[Device actions note](../../includes/machineactionsnote.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Full isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1703.
> - Full isolation is available in **public preview** for all supported Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux listed in [System requirements](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md#system-requirements).
> - Selective isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1709 or later.
> - When isolating a device, only certain processes and destinations are allowed. Therefore, devices that are behind a full VPN tunnel won't be able to reach the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud service after the device is isolated. We recommend using a split-tunneling VPN for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud-based protection-related traffic.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs](apis-intro.md)

> - The user needs to have access to the device, based on device group settings (See [Create and manage device groups](machine-groups.md) for more information)
>
