# Get devices onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-onboardconfigure-abovefoldlink)

Each onboarded device adds an additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) sensor and increases visibility over breach activity in your network. Onboarding also ensures that a device can be checked for vulnerable components as well security configuration issues and can receive critical remediation actions during attacks.

Before you can track and manage onboarding of devices:

- [Enroll your devices to Intune management](configure-machines.md#enroll-devices-to-intune-management)
- [Ensure you have the necessary permissions](configure-machines.md#obtain-required-permissions)

## Discover and track unprotected devices

The **Onboarding** card provides a high-level overview of your onboarding rate by comparing the number of Windows devices that have actually onboarded to Defender for Endpoint against the total number of Intune-managed Windows devices.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used Configuration Manager, the onboarding script, or other onboarding methods that don't use Intune profiles, you might encounter data discrepancies. To resolve these discrepancies, create a corresponding Intune configuration profile for Defender for Endpoint onboarding and assign that profile to your devices.

## Onboard more devices with Intune profiles

Defender for Endpoint provides several convenient options for [onboarding Windows devices](onboard-configure.md). For Intune-managed devices, however, you can leverage Intune profiles to conveniently deploy the Defender for Endpoint sensor to select devices, effectively onboarding these devices to the service.

From the **Onboarding** card, select **Onboard more devices** to create and assign a profile on Intune. The link takes you to the device compliance page on Intune, which provides a similar overview of your onboarding state.

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can navigate to the Defender for Endpoint onboarding compliance page in the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) from **All services > Intune > Device compliance > Microsoft Defender ATP**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to view the most up-to-date device data, click on **List of devices without ATP sensor**.

From the device compliance page, create a configuration profile specifically for the deployment of the Defender for Endpoint sensor and assign that profile to the devices you want to onboard. To do this, you can either:

- Select **Create a device configuration profile to configure ATP sensor** to start with a predefined device configuration profile.
- Create the device configuration profile from scratch.
