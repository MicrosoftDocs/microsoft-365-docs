Follow the corresponding instructions depending on your preferred deployment method.

> [!NOTE]
> The status of a device will be switched to [Inactive](fix-unhealthy-sensors.md#inactive-devices) 7 days after offboarding.
>
> Offboarded devices' data (such as Timeline, Alerts, Vulnerabilities, etc.) will remain in the portal until the configured [retention period](data-storage-privacy.md#how-long-will-microsoft-store-my-data-what-is-microsofts-data-retention-policy) expires.
>
> The device's profile (without data) will remain in the [Devices List](machines-view-overview.md) for no longer than 180 days.
>
> In addition, devices that are not active in the last 30 days are not factored in on the data that reflects your organization's Defender Vulnerability Management [exposure score](tvm-exposure-score.md) and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices.
>
> To view only active devices, you can filter by [sensor health state](machines-view-overview.md#use-filters-to-customize-the-device-inventory-views), [device tags](machine-tags.md) or [machine groups](machine-groups.md).
