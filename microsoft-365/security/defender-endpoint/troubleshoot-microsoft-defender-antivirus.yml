## Microsoft Defender Antivirus event IDs

Microsoft Defender Antivirus records event IDs in the Windows event log.

You can directly view the event log, or if you have a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) tool, you can also consume [Microsoft Defender Antivirus client event IDs](troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md#windows-defender-av-ids) to review specific events and errors from your endpoints.

The table in this section lists the main Microsoft Defender Antivirus event IDs and, where possible, provides suggested solutions to fix or resolve the error.

## To view a Microsoft Defender Antivirus event

 1. Open **Event Viewer**.
 2. In the console tree, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, then **Microsoft**, then **Windows**, then **Windows Defender**.
 3. Double-click on **Operational**.
 4. In the details pane, view the list of individual events to find your event.
 5. Click the event to see specific details about an event in the lower pane, under the **General** and **Details** tabs.

### Event ID: 2011

Symbolic name: MALWAREPROTECTION_SIGNATURE_FASTPATH_DELETED

Message: The Dynamic Signature Service deleted the out-of-date dynamic definitions.

Change to default behavior:	Change to dynamic signature event reporting default behavior

When a dynamic signature is received by MDE, a 2010 event is reported. However, when the dynamic signature expires or is manually deleted a 2011 event is reported. In some cases, when a new signature is delivered to MDE sometimes hundreds of dynamic signatures will expire at the same time; therefore hundreds of 2011 events are reported. The generation of so many 2011 events can cause a Security information and event management (SIEM) server to become flooded.

To avoid the above situation - starting with platform version 4.18.2207.7 - by default, MDE will now *not* report 2011 events:

  - This new default behavior is controlled by registry entry: **HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Reporting\EnableDynamicSignatureDroppedEventReporting.**
  - The default value for **EnableDynamicSignatureDroppedEventReporting** is **false**, which means 2011 *events are not reported*. If it's set to true, 2011 *events are reported*.
  
Because 2010 signature events are timely distributed sporadically - and will not cause a spike - 2010 signature event behavior is unchanged.

Description: Microsoft Defender Antivirus used Dynamic Signature Service to discard obsolete signatures.

 - Current Signature Version: <Current signature version>
 - Signature Type: <Signature type>, for example:
    - Antivirus
    - Antispyware
    - Antimalware

 - Removal Reason:
 - Persistence Limit Type: <Persistence limit type>, for example:
    - VDM version
    - Timestamp
    - No limit
 - Persistence Limit: Persistence limit of the fastpath signature.

User action:	No action is necessary. The Microsoft Defender Antivirus client is in a healthy state. This event is reported when the Dynamic Signature Service successfully deletes out-of-date dynamic definitions.
