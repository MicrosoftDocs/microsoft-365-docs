     - question: Event ID 2011
       answer: |

         Symbolic name: `MALWAREPROTECTION_SIGNATURE_FASTPATH_DELETED`

         Message: The Dynamic Signature Service deleted the out-of-date dynamic definitions.

         Change to default behavior: Change to dynamic signature event reporting default behavior

           When a dynamic signature is received by MDE, a 2010 event is reported. However, when the dynamic signature expires or is manually deleted a 2011 event is reported. In some cases, when a new signature is delivered to MDE sometimes hundreds of dynamic signatures expire at the same time; therefore hundreds of 2011 events are reported. The generation of so many 2011 events can cause a Security information and event management (SIEM) server to become flooded.

           To avoid the previously described situation - starting with platform version 4.18.2207.7 - by default, Defender for Endpoint will now *not* report 2011 events:

            - This new default behavior is controlled by registry entry: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Reporting\EnableDynamicSignatureDroppedEventReporting`.
            - The default value for `EnableDynamicSignatureDroppedEventReporting` is **false**, which means 2011 *events aren't reported*. If it's set to true, 2011 *events are reported*.
  
           Because 2010 signature events are timely distributed sporadically - and won't cause a spike - 2010 signature event behavior is unchanged.

         Description: Microsoft Defender Antivirus used Dynamic Signature Service to discard obsolete signatures.

          - Persistence Limit: Persistence limit of the fastpath signature.

         User action: No action is necessary. The Microsoft Defender Antivirus client is in a healthy state. This event is reported when the Dynamic Signature Service successfully deletes out-of-date dynamic definitions.
