Cloud-delivered protection for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, also referred to as Microsoft Advanced Protection Service (MAPS), provides you with strong, fast protection in addition to our standard real-time protection.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7 SP1
- Microsoft Defender Real-time protection is enabled
- Cloud-delivered protection is enabled by default, however you may need to re-enable it if it has been disabled as part of previous organizational policies. For more information, see [Enable cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus?ocid=wd-av-demo-cloud-middle).
- You can also download and use the [PowerShell script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsDefender_InternalEvaluationSettings/) to enable this setting and others on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

### Scenario

1. Download the [test file](https://aka.ms/ioavtest). Important: The test file isn't malicious, it's just a harmless file simulating a virus.

2. If you see file blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, select on "View downloads" button.

3. In Downloads menu right select on the blocked file and select on **Download unsafe file**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/cloud-delivered-protection-smartscreen-block-view-downloads.png" alt-text="Lists the download as unsafe, but provides an option to proceed with the download":::

4. You should see that "Microsoft Defender Antivirus" found a virus and deleted it.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > In some cases, you might also see **Threat Found** notification from Microsoft Defender Security Center.

5. If the file executes, or if you see that it was blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen,  cloud-delivered protection isn't working.
