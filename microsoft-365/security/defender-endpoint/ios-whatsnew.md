## Network protection

Network Protection on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now in public preview. Network protection provides protection against rogue Wi-Fi related threats, rogue hardware like pineapple devices and notifies the user if a related threat is detected. Users will also see a guided experience to connect to secure networks and change networks when they are connected to an unsecure connection.

It includes several admin controls to offer flexibility, such as the ability to configure the feature from within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin center. Admins can also enable privacy controls to configure the data that is sent by Defender for Endpoint from iOS devices. For more information, read [Configure Network Protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-network-protection).

Network protection for iOS is already enabled for your tenant. End-users who are testing Network protection feature can install the preview version of the app via TestFlight. Browse to https://aka.ms/mdeiospp on the iOS device. This will prompt you to install the TestFlight app on your device or open TestFlight in case it is already installed. On the TestFlight app, follow the onscreen instructions to install Microsoft Defender Endpoint. Please verify that the version number of MDE is 1.1.29270104.

## Privacy Controls

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS enables Privacy Controls for both the Admins and the End Users. This includes the controls for enrolled (MDM) as well as unenrolled (MAM) devices. Admins can configure the privacy in the phish alert report while End Users can configure the information shared to their organization.

## Optional Permissions and Disable Web Protection

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS enables **Optional Permissions** in the onboarding flow. Currently the permissions required by MDE are mandatory in the onboarding flow. With this feature, admin can deploy MDE on BYOD devices without enforcing the mandatory **VPN Permission** during onboarding. End Users can onboard the app without the mandatory permissions and can later review these permissions. This feature is currently present only for enrolled devices (MDM).

With **Disable Web Protection**,Customers who do not want to setup a VPN, can configure to disable **Web Protection** and deploy MDE without that feature. Other MDE features will continue to work. This configuration is available for both the enrolled (MDM) devices as well as unenrolled (MAM) devices.

## Integration with Tunnel

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS can now integrate with Microsoft Tunnel, a VPN gateway solution to enable security and connectivity in a single app.  Integration with Tunnel provides a simpler, secure VPN experience on iOS with just one app. This feature was earlier available only on Android. For more details, [see the techcommunity post here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-endpoint-manager-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-endpoint-manager-2204-april-edition/ba-p/3297995)

## Improved experience on supervised iOS devices

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS now has specialized ability on supervised iOS/iPadOS devices, given the increased management capabilities provided by the platform on these types of devices. It can also provide Web Protection **without setting up a local VPN on the device**. This gives end-users a seamless experience while still being protected from phishing and other web-based attacks.
