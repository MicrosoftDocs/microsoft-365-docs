# Better together: Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Office 365

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Microsoft 365

You might already know that:

- **Microsoft Defender Antivirus protects your Windows 10 device from software threats, such as viruses, malware, and spyware**. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is your complete, ongoing protection, built into Windows 10 and ready to go. [Microsoft Defender Antivirus is your next-generation protection](./microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10.md). 

- **Office 365 includes antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection**. With your Office 365 subscription, you get premium email and calendars, Office apps, 1 TB of cloud storage (via OneDrive), and advanced security across all your devices. This is true for home and business users. And if you're a business user, and your organization is using Office 365 E5, you get even more protection through Microsoft Defender for Office 365 [Protect against threats with Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/protect-against-threats).

- **OneDrive, included in Office 365, enables you to store your files and folders online, and share them as you see fit**. You can work together with people (for work or fun), and coauthor files that are stored in OneDrive. You can also access your files across all your devices (your PC, phone, and tablet). [Manage sharing in OneDrive](/OneDrive/manage-sharing).

**But did you know there are good security reasons to use Microsoft Defender Antivirus together with Office 365**? Here are two:

 1. [You get ransomware protection and recovery](#ransomware-protection-and-recovery).

 2. [Integration means better protection](#integration-means-better-protection).

Read the following sections to learn more.

## Ransomware protection and recovery

When you save your files to [OneDrive](/onedrive), and [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](./microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10.md) detects a ransomware threat on your device, the following things occur:

1. **You are told about the threat**. (If your organization is using [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md), your security operations team is notified, too.)

2. **Microsoft Defender Antivirus helps you (and your organization's security team) remove the ransomware** from your device(s). (If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, your security operations team can determine whether other devices are infected and take appropriate action, too.)

3. **You get the option to recover your files in OneDrive**. With the OneDrive Files Restore feature, you can recover your files in OneDrive to the state they were in before the ransomware attack occurred. See [Ransomware detection and recovering your files](https://support.office.com/article/0d90ec50-6bfd-40f4-acc7-b8c12c73637f).

Think of the time and hassle this can save. 

## Integration means better protection

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint means better protection for your organization. Here's how:

- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp) safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed in email messages, email attachments, and links (URLs) in Office documents.

    AND

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md) protects your devices from cyber threats, detects advanced attacks and data breaches, automates security incidents, and improves your security posture.

    SO

- Once integration is enabled, your security operations team can see a list of devices that are used by the recipients of any detected URLs or email messages, along with recent alerts for those devices, in the Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com)).

If you haven't already done so, [integrate Microsoft Defender for Office 365 with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/integrate-office-365-ti-with-wdatp).
