## MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS: MICROSOFT DEFENDER FOR ENDPOINT ON IOS

IF YOU LIVE IN (OR ARE A BUSINESS WITH A PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE “BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION BELOW. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except that such services or updates may have new or more terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and don't alter your or Microsoft’s rights that relate to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.  INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO APPLE INC. ("APPLE") FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT IF APPLICABLE.

1. **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.** You may install and use a copy of the software on an iOS-based device as permitted by Apple’s app store usage rules.

    a) **General.** You may install a copy of the software on an iOS-based device you own or control as permitted by Apple’s app store usage rules.

    b) **Third Party Terms of Agreement.**  Follow applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the software.

    c) **Work or School Accounts.** You can sign into the software with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain that is associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. You further agree that your use of the software may be subject to: i) your organization’s guidelines and policies about the use of the software; and ii) the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization, and in such case these terms may not apply.  If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access the software, you may be prompted to update the email address that is associated with your Microsoft account to continue accessing the software.

    d) **Third Party Components.** The software may include third-party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) that comes with the software.

    e) **Microsoft Services Agreement.** Some features of the software provide access to, or rely on, online services. The use of those services (but not the software) is governed by the separate terms and privacy policies in the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398923). Read them. The services may not be available in all regions.

1. **DATA.**

    a) **Data Collection.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must follow applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. Learn more about data collection and use, in the help documentation and the privacy statement at [https://aka.ms/privacy](https://aka.ms/privacy). Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

    b) **Processing of Personal Data.** To the extent that Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data of the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr](/legal/gdpr).

1. **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you won't (and have no right to):

    a) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;

    b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms that govern the use of certain open-source components that may be included in the software;

    c) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

    d) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or

    e) share, publish, distribute, or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

1. **TRANSFER TO ANOTHER DEVICE.** You may uninstall the software and install it on another device for your use. You may not share this license on multiple devices.

1. **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** Follow all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit [https://aka.ms/exporting](https://aka.ms/exporting).

1. **LEGAL COMPLIANCE.** You represent and warrant that (a) you aren't located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country.  (b) you aren't listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

1. **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft isn't obliged under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind. You accept that Apple doesn't have any obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services for the software.

1. **UPDATES.** The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without another notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

1. **BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** This Section applies if you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States.  If you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren't allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at [https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4](https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4). You and Microsoft agree to these terms.

1. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

1. **APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), whatever may be the conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything that is related to arbitration. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration).

1. **THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.** You agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement, and Apple has the right to enforce this agreement.

1. **PRODUCT CLAIMS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.** Microsoft, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims that relate to the software or your possession and/or use of the software. If there's any third-party claim that the software or your possession and use of that software infringes the third party’s intellectual property rights, Microsoft, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.

1. **CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights of the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement doesn't change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country don't permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

      a) **Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

      b) **Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if you reconnect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

      c) **Germany and Austria.**<br>
        i) **Warranty**. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that come with the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee for the licensed software.<br>
        ii) **Limitation of Liability.** If there is intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act and, if there is death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.<br>
        Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
1. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.** THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. IF DESIRED, YOU MAY NOTIFY APPLE FOR A REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE WILL HAVE NO OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS THAT THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

1. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM APPLE, MICROSOFT, AND MICROSOFT’S SUPPLIERS: ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to: 
    a. Anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third-party Internet sites, or third-party applications; 
    b. Claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft or Apple knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

1. **CONTACT INFORMATION.** If you have questions, complaints or claims about the software, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (see [https://aka.ms/msoffices](https://aka.ms/msoffices)).
