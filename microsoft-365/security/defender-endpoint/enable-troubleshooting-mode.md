Microsoft Defender for Endpoint troubleshooting mode allows you to troubleshoot various Microsoft Defender antivirus features by enabling them from the device and testing different scenarios, even if they're controlled by the organization policy. The troubleshooting mode is disabled by default and requires you to turn it on for a device (and/or group of devices) for a limited time. Note that this is exclusively an Enterprise-only feature, and requires Microsoft 365 Defender access.

## What do you need to know before you begin?
During troubleshooting mode, you can use the PowerShell command `Set-MPPreference -DisableTamperProtection $true` or, on client operating systems, the Security Center app to temporarily disable tamper protection on your device and make your necessary configuration changes. 

- Use troubleshooting mode to disable/change the tamper protection setting to perform:

  - Microsoft Defender Antivirus functional troubleshooting /application compatibility (false positive application blocks).
  - Microsoft Defender Antivirus performance troubleshooting by using the troubleshooting mode and manipulating tamper protection and other antivirus settings.

- If a tampering event occurs (for example, the `MpPreference` snapshot is altered or deleted), troubleshooting mode will end and tamper protection will be enabled on the device.

- Local admins, with appropriate permissions, can change configurations on individual endpoints that are usually locked by policy. Having a device in troubleshooting mode can be helpful when diagnosing Microsoft Defender Antivirus performance and compatibility scenarios.

  - Local admins won't be able to turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or uninstall it.
  - Local admins will be able to configure all other security settings in the Microsoft Defender Antivirus suite (for example, cloud protection, tamper protection).

- Admins with "Manage Security settings" permissions will have access to turn on troubleshooting mode.

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint collects logs and investigation data throughout the troubleshooting process.

  - Snapshot of `MpPreference` will be taken before troubleshooting mode begins.
  - Second snapshot will be taken just before troubleshooting mode expires.
  - Operational logs from during troubleshooting mode will also be collected.

  - All the above logs and snapshots will be collected and will be available for an admin to collect using the [Collect investigation package](respond-machine-alerts.md#collect-investigation-package-from-devices) feature on the device page. Note that Microsoft won't remove this data from the device until an admin collects them.

- Admins can also review the changes in settings that take place during Troubleshooting mode in **Event Viewer** on the device page.

- Troubleshooting mode automatically turns off after reaching the expiration time (it lasts for 3 hours). After expiration, all policy-managed configurations will become read-only again and will revert back to how it was before setting the troubleshooting mode on.

- It could take up to 15 minutes from the time the command is sent from Microsoft 365 Defender to when it becomes active on the device.

- Notification will be sent to the end user when the troubleshooting mode begins and when the troubleshooting mode ends. A warning will also be sent notifying that it will end soon.

- The beginning and ending of troubleshooting mode will be identified in the **Device Timeline** on the device page.

- You can query all troubleshooting mode events in advanced hunting.

> [!NOTE]
> Policy management changes will be applied to the machine when it is actively in Troubleshooting mode. However, the changes will not take effect until the Troubleshooting mode expires. Additionally, Microsoft Defender Antivirus Platform updates will not be applied during Troubleshooting mode. Platform updates will be applied once Troubleshooting mode ends with a Windows update.

## Prerequisites

- A device running Windows 10 (version 19044.1618 or later), Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022.

  - Defender Antivirus - Engine: 1.1.19500.2 or later ([KB2267602: Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates))

- For troubleshooting mode to be applied, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint must be tenant-enrolled and active on the device.

- The device must be actively running Microsoft Defender Antivirus, version 4.18.2203 or later.

## Enable the troubleshooting mode

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), and sign in.

2. Navigate to the device page/machine page for the device you would like to turn on troubleshooting mode. Select **Turn on troubleshooting mode**. Note that this requires "Manage security settings in Security Center" permissions for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Advanced hunting queries

Here are some pre-built advanced hunting queries to give you visibility into the troubleshooting events that are occurring in your environment. You can also use these queries to [create detection rules](/defender/custom-detection-rules.md#create-a-custom-detection-rule) that'd alert you when the devices are in troubleshooting mode.

### Get troubleshooting events for a particular device

Search by deviceId or deviceName by commenting out the respective lines. 
 
```kusto
//let deviceName = "<deviceName>";   // update with device name
let deviceId = "<deviceID>";   // update with device id
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceId == deviceId
//| where DeviceName  == deviceName
| where ActionType == "AntivirusTroubleshootModeEvent"
| extend _tsmodeproperties = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| project Timestamp,DeviceId, DeviceName, _tsmodeproperties,
 _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingState, _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingPreviousState, _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStartTime,
 _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateExpiry, _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateRemainingMinutes,
 _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateChangeReason, _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateChangeSource
```

### Devices currently in troubleshooting mode  

```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(3h) // troubleshooting mode automatically disables after 3 hours 
| where ActionType == "AntivirusTroubleshootModeEvent"
| extend _tsmodeproperties = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| where _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateChangeReason contains "started"
|summarize (Timestamp, ReportId)=arg_max(Timestamp, ReportId), count() by DeviceId
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Count of troubleshooting mode instances by device

```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "AntivirusTroubleshootModeEvent"
| extend _tsmodeproperties = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)  // choose the date range you want
| where _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateChangeReason contains "started"
| summarize (Timestamp, ReportId)=arg_max(Timestamp, ReportId), count() by DeviceId
| sort by count_
```

### Total count

```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "AntivirusTroubleshootModeEvent"
| extend _tsmodeproperties = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| where Timestamp > ago(2d) //beginning of time range
| where Timestamp < ago(1d) //end of time range
| where _tsmodeproperties.TroubleshootingStateChangeReason contains "started"
| summarize (Timestamp, ReportId)=arg_max(Timestamp, ReportId), count()
| where count_ > 5          // choose your max # of TS mode instances for your time range
```

> [!TIP]
> **Performance tip** Due to a variety of factors (examples listed below) Microsoft Defender Antivirus, like other antivirus software, can cause performance issues on endpoint devices. In some cases, you might need to tune the performance of Microsoft Defender Antivirus to alleviate those performance issues. Microsoft's **Performance analyzer** is a PowerShell command-line tool that helps determine which files, file paths, processes, and file extensions might be causing performance issues; some examples are:
>
> - Top paths that impact scan time
> - Top files that impact scan time
> - Top processes that impact scan time
> - Top file extensions that impact scan time
> - Combinations – for example:
>   - top files per extension
>   - top paths per extension
>   - top processes per path
>   - top scans per file
>   - top scans per file per process
>
> You can use the information gathered using Performance analyzer to better assess performance issues and apply remediation actions.
