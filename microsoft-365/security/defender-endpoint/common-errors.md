# Handling REST API errors 

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

HTTP error responses are divided into two categories:
* Client error (400-code level) – the client sent an invalid request or the request is not in accordance with definitions.
* Server error (500-level) – the server temporarily failed to fulfill the request or a server error occurred. Try sending the HTTP request again.

The error codes listed in the following table may be returned by an operation on any of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs.
* In addition to the error code, every error response contains an error message, which can help resolve the problem.
* The message is a free text that can be changed.
* At the bottom of the page, you can find response examples.

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)

## Throttling   
The HTTP client may receive a 'Too Many Requests error (429)' when the number of HTTP requests in a given time frame exceeds the allowed number of calls per API.

The HTTP client should delay resubmitting further HTTPS requests and then submit them in a way that complies with the rate limitations. A Retry-After in the response header indicating how long to wait (in seconds) before making a new request

Ignoring the 429 response or trying to resubmit HTTP requests in a shorter time frame will cause a return of the 429 error code.

## Body parameters are case-sensitive

The submitted body parameters are currently case-sensitive.

If you experience an **InvalidRequestBody** or **MissingRequiredParameter** errors, it might be caused from a wrong parameter capital or lower-case letter.

Review the API documentation page and check that the submitted parameters match the relevant example.

## Correlation request ID

Each error response contains a unique ID parameter for tracking.

The property name of this parameter is "target".

When contacting us about an error, attaching this ID will help find the root cause of the problem.

## Examples

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "ResourceNotFound",
        "message": "Machine 123123123 was not found",
        "target": "43f4cb08-8fac-4b65-9db1-745c2ae65f3a"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "InvalidRequestBody",
        "message": "Request body is incorrect",
        "target": "1fa66c0f-18bd-4133-b378-36d76f3a2ba0"
    }
}
```
