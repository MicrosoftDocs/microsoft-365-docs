Connected applications integrates with the Defender for Endpoint platform using APIs.

Applications use standard OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate and provide tokens for use with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs. In addition, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) applications allow tenant admins to set explicit control over which APIs can be accessed using the corresponding app.

You'll need to follow [these steps](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/apis-intro) to use the APIs with the connected application.

From the left navigation menu, select **Partners & APIs** (under **Endpoints**) > **Connected applications**.

## View connected application details

The Connected applications page provides information about the Azure AD applications connected to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in your organization. You can review the usage of the connected applications: last seen, number of requests in the past 24 hours, and request trends in the last 30 days.
