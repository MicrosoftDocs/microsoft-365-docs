   > [!NOTE]
   > After a new package version is released, support for the previous two versions is reduced to technical support only. Versions older than that which are listed in this section are provided for technical upgrade support only.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > Running Defender for Endpoint on Linux side by side with other `fanotify`-based security solutions is not supported. It can lead to unpredictable results, including hanging the operating system. If there are any other applications on the system that use `fanotify` in blocking mode, applications are listed in the `conflicting_applications` field of the `mdatp health` command output. The Linux **FAPolicyD** feature uses `fanotify` in blocking mode, and is therefore unsupported when running Defender for Endpoint in active mode. You can still safely take advantage of Defender for Endpoint on Linux EDR functionality after configuring the antivirus functionality Real Time Protection Enabled to [Passive mode](linux-preferences.md#enforcement-level-for-antivirus-engine).

- Disk space: 2 GB

  > [!NOTE]
  > An additional 2 GB disk space might be needed if cloud diagnostics are enabled for crash collections.

- /opt/microsoft/mdatp/sbin/wdavdaemon requires executable permission. For more information, see "Ensure that the daemon has executable permission" in [Troubleshoot installation issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-support-install).

- Cores: 2 minimum, 4 preferred

- Memory: 1 GB minimum, 4 preferred

    > [!NOTE]
    > Please make sure that you have free disk space in /var.

- The solution currently provides real-time protection for the following file system types:

  - `btrfs`
  - `ecryptfs`
  - `ext2`
  - `ext3`
  - `ext4`
  - `fuse`
  - `fuseblk`
  - `jfs`
  - `nfs (v3 only)`
  - `overlay`
  - `ramfs`
  - `reiserfs`
  - `tmpfs`
  - `udf`
  - `vfat`
  - `xfs`

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

- Audit framework (`auditd`) must be enabled.

  > [!NOTE]
  > System events captured by rules added to `/etc/audit/rules.d/` will add to `audit.log`(s) and might affect host auditing and upstream collection. Events added by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux will be tagged with `mdatp` key.

### External package dependency
The following external package dependencies exist for the mdatp package:
- The mdatp RPM package requires "glibc >= 2.17", "audit", "policycoreutils", "semanage" "selinux-policy-targeted", "mde-netfilter"
- For RHEL6 the mdatp RPM package requires "audit", "policycoreutils", "libselinux", "mde-netfilter"
- For DEBIAN the mdatp package requires "libc6 >= 2.23", "uuid-runtime", "auditd", "mde-netfilter"

The mde-netfilter package also has the following package dependencies:
- For DEBIAN the mde-netfilter package requires "libnetfilter-queue1", "libglib2.0-0"
- For RPM the mde-netfilter package requires "libmnl", "libnfnetlink", "libnetfilter_queue", "glib2"

If the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation fails due to missing dependencies errors, you can manually download the pre-requisite dependencies.

### Configuring Exclusions

When adding exclusions to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, you should be mindful of [Common Exclusion Mistakes for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/common-exclusion-mistakes-microsoft-defender-antivirus)

### Network connections

The following downloadable spreadsheet lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure that there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs. If there are, you may need to create an *allow* rule specifically for them.

|Spreadsheet of domains list| Description|
|---|---|
|Microsoft Defender for Endpoint URL list for commercial customers| Spreadsheet of specific DNS records for service locations, geographic locations, and OS for commercial customers. <p> [Download the spreadsheet here.](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/b/f/6bfff670-47c3-4e45-b01b-64a2610eaefa/mde-urls-commercial.xlsx)|
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint URL list for Gov/GCC/DoD | Spreadsheet of specific DNS records for service locations, geographic locations, and OS for Gov/GCC/DoD customers. <p> [Download the spreadsheet here.](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/a/0/6a041da5-c43b-4f17-8167-79dfdc10507f/mde-urls-gov.xlsx)|

> [!NOTE]
> For a more specific URL list, see [Configure proxy and internet connectivity settings](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-atp-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server).

Defender for Endpoint can discover a proxy server by using the following discovery methods:

- Transparent proxy
- Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs. For transparent proxies, no additional configuration is needed for Defender for Endpoint. For static proxy, follow the steps in [Manual Static Proxy Configuration](linux-static-proxy-configuration.md).

> [!WARNING]
> PAC, WPAD, and authenticated proxies are not supported. Ensure that only a static proxy or transparent proxy is being used.
>
> SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are also not supported for security reasons. Configure an exception for SSL inspection and your proxy server to directly pass through data from Defender for Endpoint on Linux to the relevant URLs without interception. Adding your interception certificate to the global store will not allow for interception.

For troubleshooting steps, see [Troubleshoot cloud connectivity issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-support-connectivity.md).
