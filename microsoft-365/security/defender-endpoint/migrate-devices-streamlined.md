# Migrate devices to use the streamlined connectivity method

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)


[!Include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]


This article describes how to migrate (reonboard) devices that are currently onboarded to Defender for Endpoint to use the streamlined device connectivity method. For more information on streamlined connectivity, see [Onboarding devices using streamlined connectivity](configure-device-connectivity.md). Devices must meet the prerequisites listed in [Streamlined connectivity](configure-device-connectivity.md#prerequisites). 

In most cases, full device offboarding isn't required when reonboarding. You can run the updated onboarding package and reboot your device to switch connectivity over. See below for details on individual operating systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview limitations and known issues: <br>
> - For device migrations (reonboarding): Offboarding is not required to switch over to streamlined connectivity method. Once the updated onboarding package is run, a full device reboot is required for Windows devices and a service restart for macOS and Linux. For more information, see the details included in this article. <br>
> - Windows 10 versions 1607, 1703, 1709, and 1803 do not support reonboarding. Offboard first and then onboard using the updated package. These versions also require a longer URL list. 
> - Devices running the MMA agent are not supported and must continue using the MMA onboarding method.

## Migrating devices using the streamlined method

### Migration recommendation:

- **Start small**. It's recommended to start with a small set of devices first, apply the onboarding blob using any of the supported deployment tools, then monitor for connectivity. If you are using a new onboarding policy, to prevent conflicts make sure to exclude device from any other existing onboarding policies.  

- **Validate and monitor**. After onboarding the small set of devices, validate that devices have successfully onboarded and are communicating with the service. 

- **Complete migration**. At this stage, you can gradually roll out the migration to a larger set of devices. To complete the migration, you can replace previous onboarding policies and remove the old URLs from your network device.
  
Validate [device prerequisites](configure-device-connectivity.md#prerequisites) before proceeding with any migrations. This information builds upon the previous article by focusing on migrating existing devices. 

To reonboard devices, you will need to use the streamlined onboarding package. For more information on how to access the package, see [Streamlined connectivity](configure-device-connectivity.md).

Depending on the OS, migrations may require a device reboot or service restart once the onboarding package is applied:

- Windows: reboot the device
- macOS: Reboot the device or restart the Defender for Endpoint service by running:
  1.	`sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.fresno.plist`
  2.	`sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.fresno.plist` 
	
- Linux: Restart the Defender for Endpoint service by running: `sudo systemctl restart mdatp`

The following table lists migration instructions for the available onboarding tools based on the device's operating system.

## Verifying device connectivity with streamlined method for migrated devices

You can use the following methods to check that you have successfully connected Windows devices:

- [Client analyzer](#use-defender-for-endpoint-client-analyzer-windows-to-validate-connectivity-after-onboarding-for-migrated-endpoints)
- [Tracking with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR](#tracking-with-advanced-hunting-in-microsoft-365-defender)
- [Track locally using Event Viewer (for Windows)](#tracking-locally-on-a-device-through-windows-event-viewer)
- [Run tests to confirm connectivity with Defender for Endpoint services](#)
- Checking the registry editor
- [PowerShell detection test](#powershell-detection-test)

For macOS and Linux, you can use the following methods:

- MDATP connectivity tests
- Tracking with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR
- Run tests to confirm connectivity with Defender for Endpoint services

### Use Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer (Windows) to validate connectivity after onboarding for migrated endpoints

Once onboarded, run the MDE Client Analyzer to confirm your device is connecting to the appropriate updated URLs.

Download the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer tool where Defender for Endpoint sensor is running.

You can follow the same instructions as in [Verify client connectivity to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service](verify-connectivity.md).  The script automatically uses the onboarding package configured on the device (should be streamlined version) to test connectivity. 

Ensure connectivity is established with the appropriate URLs. 

<a name='tracking-with-advanced-hunting-in-microsoft-365-defender'></a>

### Tracking with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR

You can use advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender portal to view the connectivity type status. 

This information is found in the DeviceInfo table under the "ConnectivityType" column:
- Column Name: ConnectivityType
- Possible Values: `<blank>`, Streamlined, Standard
- Data type: String
- Description: Type of connectivity from the device to the cloud

Once a device is migrated to use the streamlined method and the device establishes successful communication with the EDR command & control channel, the value will be represented as "Streamlined".

If you move the device back to the regular method, the value will be "standard".

For devices that have not yet attempted reonboard, the value will remain blank. 


### Tracking locally on a device through Windows Event Viewer

You can use Windows Event Viewer's SENSE operational log to locally validate connections with the new streamlined approach. SENSE Event ID 4 tracks successful EDR connections.

Open the Defender for Endpoint service event log using the following steps:

1. On the Windows menu, select **Start**, then type **Event Viewer**. Then select **Event Viewer**.

2. In the log list, under **Log Summary**, scroll down until you see **Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational**. Double-click the item to open the log. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/log-summary-event-viewer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Event Viewer with log summary section":::

	You can also access the log by expanding**Applications and Services Logs>Microsoft>Windows>SENSE** and select **Operational**. 

3. Event ID 4 tracks successful connections with Defender for Endpoint Command & Control channel. Verify successful connections with updated URL. For example:

    ```
    Contacted server 6 times, all succeeded, URI: <region>.<geo>.endpoint.security.microsoft.com. 
	<EventData> 
	  <Data Name="UInt1">6</Data>  
	  <Data Name="Message1">https://<region>.<geo>.endpoint.security.microsoft.com>  
	</EventData> 
	```

4. Message1 contains the contacted URL. Confirm the event includes the streamlined URL (endpoint.security.microsoft, com).

5. Event ID 5 tracks errors if applicable. 

> [!NOTE]
> SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. <br>
> Events recorded by the service will appear in the log. <br>
> For more information, see [Review events and error using Event Viewer](event-error-codes.md).

### Run tests to confirm connectivity with Defender for Endpoint services  

Once the device is onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, validate that it's continuing to appear in Device Inventory. The DeviceID should remain the same.

Check the Device Page Timeline tab to confirm events are flowing from the device. 

#### Live Response 

Ensure [Live Response](respond-machine-alerts.md#initiate-live-response-session) is working on your test device. Follow instructions in [Investigate entities on devices using live response](live-response.md).

Make sure to run a couple of basic commands post-connection to confirm connectivity (such as cd, jobs, connect).

#### Automated investigation and response 

Ensure that Automated investigation and response is working on your test device: [Configure automated investigation and response capabilities](/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-configure-auto-investigation-response).

For Auto-IR testing labs, navigate to **Microsoft Defender XDR** \> **Evaluations & Tutorials** \> **Tutorials & Simulations** \> **Tutorials \> **Automated Investigation tutorials**.

#### Cloud-delivered protection 

1. Open a Command Prompt as an administrator.

2. Right-click the item in the Start menu, select **Run as administrator** then select **Yes** at the permissions prompt. 

3. Use the following argument with the Microsoft Defender Antivirus command-line utility (mpcmdrun.exe) to verify that your network can communicate with the Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud service: 

	```
	"%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -ValidateMapsConnection
	```

  > [!NOTE]
  > This command will only work on Windows 10, version 1703 or higher, or Windows 11. 
  > For more information, see [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus with the mpcmdrun.exe commandline tool](command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md). 

#### Test Block at First Sight 

Follow instructions in [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Block at First Sight (BAFS) demonstration](defender-endpoint-demonstration-block-at-first-sight-bafs.md).

#### Test SmartScreen 

Follow instructions in [Microsoft Defender SmartScreen Demo (msft.net)](https://demo.smartscreen.msft.net/). 


### PowerShell detection test
1. On the Windows device, create a folder: `C:\test-MDATP-test`.

2. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.

3. In the Command Prompt window, run the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference = 'silentlycontinue';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe');Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
   ```

After the command runs, the Command Prompt window closes automatically. If successful, the detection test is marked as completed.

For macOS and Linux, you can use the following methods:

- MDATP connectivity tests
- Tracking with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR
- Run tests to confirm connectivity with Defender for Endpoint services

### MDATP connectivity test (macOS and Linux)

Run `mdatp health -details features ` to confirm simplified_connectivity: "enabled".

Run `mdatp health -details edr` to confirm `edr_partner_geo_location` is available. The value should be `GW_<geo>` where 'geo' is your tenant's geo-location.

Run mdatp connectivity test. Ensure the streamlined URL pattern is present. You should expect two for '\storage', one for '\mdav', one for '\xplat', and one for '/packages'.

For example: `https:mdav.us.endpoint.security.microsoft/com/storage`

### Tracking with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR

Follow the same instructions as for Windows.

### Use Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer (cross-platform) to validate connectivity for newly migrated endpoints

Download and run the client analyzer for macOS or Linux. For more information, see [Download and run the client analyzer](download-client-analyzer.md).

1. Run `mdeclientanalyzer.cmd -o <path to cmd file>` from within the MDEClientAnalyzer folder. The command uses parameters from the onboarding package to test connectivity.

2.	Run `mdeclientanalyzer.cmd -g <GW_US, GW_UK, GW_EU>` (where parameter is of GW_US, GW_EU, GW_UK). GW refers to the streamlined option. Run with applicable tenant geo.
