# Visit the Action center to see remediation actions

During and after an automated investigation, remediation actions for threat detections are identified. Depending on the particular threat and how [automated investigation and remediation capabilities are configured](configure-automated-investigations-remediation.md) for your organization, some remediation actions are taken automatically, and others require approval. If you're part of your organization's security operations team, you can view pending and completed [remediation actions](manage-auto-investigation.md#remediation-actions) in the **Action center**.

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Business](../defender-business/mdb-overview.md)

## The unified Action center

Recently, the Action center was updated. You now have a unified Action center experience. To access your Action center, go to [https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center) and sign in.

The unified Action center brings together remediation actions across Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Office 365. It defines a common language for all remediation actions, and provides a unified investigation experience.

You can use the unified Action center if you have appropriate permissions and one or more of the following subscriptions:

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-threat-protection)
- [Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365)
- [Defender for Business](../defender-business/mdb-overview.md)
