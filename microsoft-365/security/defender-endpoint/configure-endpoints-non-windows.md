[!INCLUDE [Defender for Endpoint repackaging warning](../../includes/repackaging-warning.md)]


You'll need to take the following steps:

1.	Select your preferred method of onboarding:
    - To onboard macOS devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Mac](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac).
    - To onboard Linux devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux).
    - To onboard non-windows devices using third party solution:
        1.	In the navigation pane, select **Partners and APIs > Connected Applications**. Make sure the third-party solution is listed.
        2.	In the **Connected Applications** page, select the partner that supports your non-Windows devices.
        3.	Select **View** to open the partner's page. Follow the instructions provided on the page.
        4.	After creating an account or subscribing to the partner solution, you should get to a stage where a tenant Global Admin in your organization is asked to accept a permission request from the partner application. Read the permission request carefully to make sure that it's aligned with the service that you require.


2. Run a detection test by following the instructions of the third-party solution.

## Offboard non-Windows devices

For macOS and Linux devices, you can choose to offboard through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Offboard** \> **Select Operating System to start the offboarding Process**.

You can also offboard non-Windows devices by disabling the third-party integration. Enable coverage for devices running non-Windows platforms by [integrating third-party solutions](https://security.microsoft.com/interoperability/partners).
