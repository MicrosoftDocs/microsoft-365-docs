## Onboarding non-Windows devices

You can choose to onboard non-Windows devices through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or through a third-party solution.

[!INCLUDE [Defender for Endpoint repackaging warning](../../includes/repackaging-warning.md)]

You'll need to take the following steps:

1. Select your preferred method of onboarding:
   - To onboard macOS devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Mac](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac).
   - To onboard Linux devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux).
   - To onboard non-windows devices using third party solution:
     1. In the navigation pane, select **Partners and APIs > Connected Applications**. Make sure the third-party solution is listed.
     2. In the **Connected Applications** page, select the partner that supports your non-Windows devices.
     3. Select **View** to open the partner's page. Follow the instructions provided on the page.
     4. After creating an account or subscribing to the partner solution, you should get to a stage where a tenant Global Admin in your organization is asked to accept a permission request from the partner application. Read the permission request carefully to make sure that it's aligned with the service that you require.

2. Run a detection test by following the instructions of the third-party solution.

## Offboard non-Windows devices

For macOS and Linux devices, you can choose to offboard through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Offboard** > **Select Operating System to start the offboarding Process**.

For details on offboarding Microsoft Defender on macOS, see [Uninstalling Microsoft Defender for macOS](mac-resources.md).

You can also offboard non-Windows devices by disabling the third-party integration. Enable coverage for devices running non-Windows platforms by [integrating third-party solutions](https://security.microsoft.com/interoperability/partners).
