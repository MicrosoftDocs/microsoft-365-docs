## December 2022

Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS is now Generally Available. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For more details,  see [Configure vulnerability assessment of apps](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-vulnerability-assessment-of-apps).

## October 2022

Several Linux platforms have high numbers of CVEs that are reported in official channels as not having a fix available (Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu). This results in a high volume of non-actionable CVEs appearing in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

To address this, Defender Vulnerability Management will no longer report such CVEs on the above Linux platforms. The new behavior may lead to reporting of fewer exposed devices and lower organization exposure score.

## September 2022

- Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS is now in public preview. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For more information, see [Configure vulnerability assessment of apps](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-vulnerability-assessment-of-apps). If you are interested in participating in the preview, share your tenant name and ID with us at: [mdatpmobile@microsoft.com](mailto:mdatpmobile@microsoft.com).

## August 2022

- Defender Vulnerability Management is now supported for Amazon Linux 2 and Fedora 33 or higher.

- [Browser extensions APIs](../defender-endpoint/get-assessment-browser-extensions.md) </br>
  You can now use the new browser extensions APIs to view all browser extensions installed in your organization, including installed versions, permissions requested,  and associated risk.

- [Extended software inventory API support for non product code software](../defender-endpoint/get-assessment-non-cpe-software-inventory.md) </br>
  A new API is now available and returns all the data for installed software that doesn't have a [Common Platform Enumeration(CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe). The information returned by this API, along with the information returned by the Export software inventory assessment API, for software that does have a CPE, gives you full visibility into the software installed across your organization and the devices it's installed on.
