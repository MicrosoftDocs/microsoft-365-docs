This string is now represented in the portal for every weakness, and can be pulled via the [List vulnerabilities API](../defender-endpoint/api/get-all-vulnerabilities.md) and Advanced Hunting. For more information on the CVSS Vector, see [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#:~:text=The%20Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System,Threat%2C%20Environmental%2C%20and%20Supplemental)

## December 2022

Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS is now Generally Available. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For more details,  see [Configure vulnerability assessment of apps](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-vulnerability-assessment-of-apps).

## October 2022

Several Linux platforms have high numbers of CVEs that are reported in official channels as not having a fix available (Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu). This results in a high volume of non-actionable CVEs appearing in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

To address this, Defender Vulnerability Management will no longer report such CVEs on the above Linux platforms. The new behavior may lead to reporting of fewer exposed devices and lower organization exposure score.

## September 2022

- Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS is now in public preview. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For more information, see [Configure vulnerability assessment of apps](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-vulnerability-assessment-of-apps).
