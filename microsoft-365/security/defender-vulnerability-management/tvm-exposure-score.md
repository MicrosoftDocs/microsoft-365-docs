# Exposure score in Defender Vulnerability Management

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

>[!Note]
> Want to experience Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management? Learn more about how you can sign up to the [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management public preview trial](../defender-vulnerability-management/get-defender-vulnerability-management.md).

Your exposure score is visible in the [Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard](tvm-dashboard-insights.md) of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. It reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. Low exposure score means your devices are less vulnerable from exploitation.

- Quickly understand and identify high-level takeaways about the state of security in your organization.
- Detect and respond to areas that require investigation or action to improve the current state.
- Communicate with peers and management about the impact of security efforts.

The card gives you a high-level view of your exposure score trend over time. Any spikes in the chart give you a visual indication of a high cybersecurity threat exposure that you can investigate further.

## How it works

The exposure score is broken down into the following levels:

- 0-29: low exposure score
- 30-69: medium exposure score
- 70-100: high exposure score

You can remediate the issues based on prioritized [security recommendations](tvm-security-recommendation.md) to reduce the exposure score. Each software has weaknesses that are transformed into recommendations and prioritized based on risk to the organization.

## Reduce your vulnerability exposure

Lower your vulnerability exposure by remediating [security recommendations](tvm-security-recommendation.md). Make the most impact to your exposure score by remediating the top security recommendations, which can be viewed in the [Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard](tvm-dashboard-insights.md).
