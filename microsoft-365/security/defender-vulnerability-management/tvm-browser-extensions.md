# Browser extensions assessment

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan)

> [!NOTE]
> To use this feature you'll require Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Standalone or if you're already a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 customer, the Defender Vulnerability Management add-on.

A browser extension is a small software application that adds functionality to a web browser. Visibility into the browser extensions installed can help you ensure the safe usage of extensions in your organization.

The **Browser extensions** page displays a list of the browser extensions installed across different browsers in your organization. For each installed extension, you can see the devices it's installed on and if it's turned on or off on these devices. You can also filter the view by users to see which browser extensions they're using on which device. The information available will not only help you learn about the installed extensions, but it can help you make decisions on how you want to manage the extensions.

> [!TIP]
> Did you know you can try all the features in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management for free? Find out how to [sign up for a free trial](../defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management-trial.md).

## View your browser extensions

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** \> **Software inventory** in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Browser extensions** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Browser extension assessment is only available on Windows devices. Only extensions that exist in Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, will appear in browser extension list.

The **Browser extensions** page opens with a list of the browser extensions installed across your organization, including details on the extension name, browser, the number of devices the extension is installed on, and the number that have it turned on.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Browser extensions page" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions.png":::

You can use the Browser filter to view the relevant list of extensions for a particular browser.

The **Requested permissions** and **Permissions risk** columns provide more specific information on the number of permissions requested by the extension, and the permissions risk level based on the type of access to devices or sites it requested.

Select a browser extension to open its flyout pane, where you can learn more about the extension:

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Browser extensions details pane" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_details.png":::

Where applicable, there will be a link available on this page to access the extension in the store it was installed from.

### Browser extension permissions

Browser extensions usually need different types of permission to run properly, for example, they may require permission to modify a webpage.

Select the **Permissions** tab, from the browser extension flyout pane, to see information on the permissions the browser extension needs to run, and whether this permission is optional or not.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Browser extensions permissions page" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_permissions.png":::

The permission risk level generated is based on the type of access the permission is requesting. You can use this information to help make an informed decision on whether you want to allow or block this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Risk is subjective, and it's up to each organization to determine the types of risk they are willing to take on.

Select a permission to see a further flyout with more information.

### View installed devices

To see the list of the devices the extension is installed on, choose the **Installed devices** tab from the browser extension flyout pane:

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_devices.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Browser extensions devices tab" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/browser_extensions_devices.png":::

From here, you can search for a particular device the extension is installed on, and you can export a list of the devices to a csv file.

### View installed versions

Select the **Installed versions** tab, from the browser extension flyout pane, to see information on the versions of the extension installed in your organization.
