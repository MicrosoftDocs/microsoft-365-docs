# Device restart status

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229011)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan)

Security recommendations in Defender Vulnerability Management can help reduce your overall vulnerability exposure and your exposure score. A robust update process is key when it comes to addressing these recommendations in your organization. If an update hasn't completed for some devices due to a pending restart, the effect of addressing the security recommendation isn't reflected in your exposure score.

The **Pending restart** tag helps you identify devices in this state so you can take action, and it gives you visibility into why some update actions taken aren't being reflected in your exposure score.

> [!NOTE]
> The tag is currently available for Windows(OS) updates and KB corrections.
