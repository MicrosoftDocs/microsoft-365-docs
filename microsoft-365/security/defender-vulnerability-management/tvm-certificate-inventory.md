# Certificate inventory

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan)

> [!NOTE]
> To use this feature you'll require Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Standalone or if you're already a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 customer, the Defender Vulnerability Management add-on.

Certificates can be used in multiple ways, this includes:

- being part of the TLS\SSL protocol
- user certificates being used for VPN client authentication, document signing, email encryption and email signing
- providing data encryption and authentication to ensure the secure transfer of information within your network and over the internet

If there is an issue with a certificate, for example, it has expired or is misconfigured, it could leave your organization vulnerable, cause an outage, and have an impact on day-to-day business operations.

The **Certificate inventory** lets you view a list of the certificates installed across your organization in a single central certificate inventory page. This can help you:

- Identify certificates that are about to expire so you can update them and prevent service disruption
- Detect potential vulnerabilities due to the use of weak signature algorithm (e.g. SHA-1-RSA), short key size (e.g. RSA 512bit), or weak signature hash algorithm (e.g. MD5)
- Ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines and organizational policy

## View your certificates

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** > **Software inventory** in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Certificates** tab.

The **Certificate inventory** page opens with a list of the certificates installed across your organization, including details on the expiration date, key size, who issued the certificate, and the number of instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Only certificates found on Windows devices (in the local machine certificate store) will be displayed in certificate inventory list.

## Gain insights into potentially vulnerable certificates

At the top of the page, you can view the number of certificates that have been identified as potentially less secure and introduce risk into your organization. This includes the number of certificates that:

- have already expired
- will expire in 60 days or less
- have a key size with fewer than 2048 bits, as they are considered less secure
- have a weak signature algorithm, like SHA-1 and MD5
- are considered vulnerable since they are self-signed

## Use filters on the certificate inventory page

You can use filters to view the inventory based on:

- **Certificate status:** view the certificates that have expired, are expiring soon, are issued with a future date, or are current
- **Self-signed:** view certificates that are self-signed
- **Key size:** view certificates that have a short key size or valid key size
- **Signature hash:** view certificates that have a weak signature hash or valid signature hash
- **Key usage:** view certificates with key usage values, such as digital signature, repudiation, and certificate signing

## Get more information on a discovered certificate

When you select the certificate that you want to investigate, a flyout panel will open with the certificate details page:

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/certificate_details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the certificate details page" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/certificate_details.png":::

You can select the **Issuing details** tab to see information on who the certificate was issued to and who it was issued by.

### Certificates on devices

To see the list of the devices the certificate is installed on, choose the **Installed devices** tab from the certificate flyout pane. From here, you can search for a particular device the certificate is installed on, and you can export a list of the devices to a csv file.

You can also view a list of certificates installed on a device:

1. Select the device from the **Installed devices** tab in the flyout panel or select the device directly from the **Device inventory** page.
2. Select the **Certificate inventory** tab to see a list of certificates installed on that device.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/certificate_inventory_page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the certificate inventory page" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/certificate_inventory_page.png":::

3. Select a certificate to open the flyout with more information.

## Vulnerability management dashboard widget

See how many certificates have expired or are due to expire in the next 30, 60 or 90 days from the **Expiring certificates** widget available in the vulnerability management dashboard.

Select **View all** to go to the certificate inventory page.

## Use advanced hunting

You can use advanced hunting queries to gain visibility on certificates in your organization. For example, using the **DeviceTvmCertificateInfo** table, you can query to show all expired certificates.
