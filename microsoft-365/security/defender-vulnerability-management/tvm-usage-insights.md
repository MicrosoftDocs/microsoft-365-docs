Defender Vulnerability Management software usage information gives you insights into the total number of devices using an application in your organization and the median usage (in days) for that application over the past 30 days.

Software usage information is critical when it comes to evaluating software vulnerabilities in your organization. When vulnerable applications are widely and frequently used, it poses a security risk. These insights can help organizations understand the potential affect of blocking vulnerable applications.

## Minimum requirements

**Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active or passive mode)**:
The detection of file execution events requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be enabled in active or passive mode. To learn more, see [Deploy Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../defender-endpoint/deploy-manage-report-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

## View software usage information

Daily software usage is calculated from process events collected by the core endpoint detection and response service for all onboarded devices. Software usage information can be viewed through the following experiences in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

### Software inventory view

You can view software usage by selecting an application in the software inventory page. A flyout panel will open with more details including data related to that software’s usage over the past 30 days.
