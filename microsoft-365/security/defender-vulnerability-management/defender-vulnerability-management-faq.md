## Defender Vulnerability Management licensing FAQs

### What license does the user need to benefit from Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities?

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is available for public preview via two services:

1. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 / E5 customers can seamlessly enhance their existing generally available vulnerability management capabilities with the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management add-on. This service provides consolidated inventories, expanded asset coverage, cross-platform support, and new assessment and mitigation tools. Customers can directly sign up for the [free 120-day public preview trial](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=5908ecaa-b8a7-4a04-b6c0-d44fd934b6f2&ali=1&bac=1&signedinuser=siosulli%40microsoft.com).

2. For non-Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 / non-E5 customers looking for a risk-based vulnerability management solution, Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management standalone helps you efficiently discover, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in one place. Customers can [email](mailto:mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) (mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) to sign up for the free 120-day public preview trial.

### Is Defender Vulnerability Management available as part of E5?

If the customer has E5, they have Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 and core vulnerability management capabilities. Defender Vulnerability Management is a separate solution from Defender for Endpoint (not included in E5) and is available as an add-on.

### Why is this value not included in Defender for Endpoint Plan 2?

As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we’re committed to providing an enhanced vulnerability management solution beyond the core capabilities currently in Defender for Endpoint Plan 2. Defender Vulnerability Management includes significant new value such as enhanced discovery and assessment tools, consolidated inventories, and risk mitigation capabilities. It will also be our dedicated solution for all currently planned and upcoming vulnerability management engineering investments.

## Defender Vulnerability Management trial FAQs

### How do customers sign up for a trial?

For existing Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 / E5 customers who want to evaluate the experience first-hand, we encourage directly onboarding onto the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management add-on [free 120-day public preview trial](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=5908ecaa-b8a7-4a04-b6c0-d44fd934b6f2&ali=1&bac=1&signedinuser=siosulli%40microsoft.com). For more information, see [Get Defender Vulnerability Management](get-defender-vulnerability-management.md).

For new customers (non-Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 / non-E5), [email](mailto:mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) (mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) to sign up for the free 120-day public preview trial.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers need to have the global admin role defined in Azure AD to onboard the trial.
>
> We’re happy to assist with initial trial onboarding and to meet with customers to provide an overview of the product capabilities. To do this or if you have any questions, [contact us](mailto:mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) (mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) and we will get in touch!

### How is the service provisioned/deployed?

Once a customer is onboarded on to the free-trial experience, Defender Vulnerability Management features are turned on by default at the tenant level for all users within the organization.

### Do I need to assign Defender Vulnerability Management trial licenses to users in my organization as instructed in the admin center?

Currently, there is no need to assign the new Defender Vulnerability Management license to users. Licenses will be applied automatically after a customer signs up for the free public preview trial.

### If a customer is in private preview, what will happen to their premium capabilities if I don’t sign up for a free public preview trial?

The new capabilities will be available only to customers who onboard the public preview trial. Customers who haven’t onboarded will lose access to these capabilities. Blocked applications will be immediately unblocked. Security baseline profiles may be stored for a short additional time before being deleted.

### How long does the public preview trial last and what happens at the end of my trial?

The public preview trial lasts for 120 days.

After your trial ends, you'll have a 30 day grace period of active trial before the license becomes suspended. When the trial is suspended, you will retain your security baselines, but you may lose access to your portal and your blocked applications may become unblocked.

After 180 days, your license will be deactivated and your profiles will be deleted.

## Block vulnerable applications FAQs

### I want to block a vulnerable application but it's not showing up as available to block?

If you try to block an application and it doesn’t work, you may have reached the maximum indicator capacity. If this is the case, you can delete old indicators. To learn more see, [Manage indicators](../defender-endpoint/indicator-manage.md).

Recommendations that don’t include mitigation actions (such as block) include:

- Microsoft applications
- Recommendations related to operating systems  
- Recommendations related to apps for MacOS and Linux  
- Apps where Microsoft does not have sufficient information or a high confidence to block

### Does blocking vulnerable apps work on all devices?

This feature is supported on Windows devices (1809 or later) with the latest Windows updates installed. Each device must have a minimum antimalware client version of 4.18.1901.x or later. The Engine version must be 1.1.16200.x or later.

## Security baselines FAQs

### What is the full list of baseline benchmarks I can use as part of security baselines assessment?

There is currently support for:

- Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks for Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2008R2 and above.
- Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) benchmarks for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

### What operating systems can I measure using security baseline assessments?

Currently Windows is supported, but coverage will be expanded to cover additional operating systems such as Mac and Linux.

## Defender Vulnerability Management general FAQs

### Can I set up a customer meeting to learn more about Defender Vulnerability Management?

Yes, to do this or if you have any questions, [contact us](mailto:mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) (mdvmtrial@microsoft.com) and we will get in touch!

### Where can I find the full list of capabilities across different plans?

For details on the full list of capabilities across Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and Defender for Endpoint, see [Defender Vulnerability Management Capabilities](defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities.md).

### Can customers buy only one capability?

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is available as a vulnerability management solution comprised of multiple premium capabilities.

### Can I turn on Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities on a subset of devices in my organization?

There isn’t a way to selectively light up the Defender Vulnerability Management assessment capabilities (block vulnerable applications, browser extension, certificate inventory, and network share assessment) on a subset of devices in a given tenant.
