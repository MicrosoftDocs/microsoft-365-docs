Ensure that your devices:

- Are onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 or Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

- Run [supported operating systems and platforms](tvm-supported-os.md)

- Have the following mandatory updates installed and deployed in your network to boost your vulnerability assessment detection rates:

  > Release | Security update KB number and link
  > :---|:---
  > Windows 10 Version 1709 | [KB4493441](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4493441/windows-10-update-kb4493441) and [KB 4516071](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4516071/windows-10-update-kb4516071)
  > Windows 10 Version 1803 | [KB4493464](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4493464) and [KB 4516045](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4516045/windows-10-update-kb4516045)
  > Windows 10 Version 1809 | [KB 4516077](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4516077/windows-10-update-kb4516077)

If you're using Configuration Manager, update your console to the latest version.
