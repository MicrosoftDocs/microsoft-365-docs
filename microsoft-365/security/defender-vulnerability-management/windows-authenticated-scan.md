# Authenticated scan for Windows

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Authenticated scan for Windows provides the ability to run scans on unmanaged Windows devices. You can remotely target by IP ranges or hostnames and scan Windows services by providing Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management with credentials to remotely access the devices. Once configured the targeted unmanaged devices will be scanned regularly for software vulnerabilities.

This is applicable for devices that don't have the Defender Vulnerability Management or Defender for Endpoint agent deployed.

## Scanner Installation

Similar to [network device](../defender-endpoint/network-devices.md) authenticated scan, you'll need a scanning device with the scanner installed. If you don’t already have the scanner installed, see [Install the scanner](../defender-endpoint/network-devices.md#install-the-scanner) for steps on how to download and install it.

>[!NOTE]
> No changes are required for pre-existing installed scanners.

## Pre-requisites

The following section lists the pre-requisites you need to configure to use Authenticated scan for Windows.

### Scanning account

A scanning account is required to remotely access the devices. This must be a [Group Managed Service Account (gMsa)](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview/). To create a gMsa account:

1. On your domain controller in a PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
New-ADServiceAccount -name gmsa1 -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword scanner-win11-i$ -KerberosEncryptionType RC4, AES128, AES256 –verbose
```

   - gmsa1 stands for the name of the account you are creating, and scanner-win11-I$ stands for the machine name where the scanner agent will run. Only this machine will be able to retrieve the account password. You can provide a comma separated list of machines.
   - Modifying an existing account can be done with *Get-ADServiceAccount* and *Set-ADServiceAccount*

2. To Install the AD Service Account, on the machine where the scanner agent will run using an elevated PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity gmsa1
```

If your PowerShell doesn’t recognize those commands, it probably means you're missing a required PowerShell module. Instructions on how to install the module vary depending on your operating system. For more information, see [Getting Started with Group Managed Service Accounts](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts/).

### Devices to be scanned

Use the table below for guidance on what needs to be configured on the devices that will be scanned.

>[!Note]
> The account to be used for scanning requires all the permissions below. The below steps are only one recommended way to configure the permissions on the devices to be scanned and uses the Performance Monitor Users group. You can also add the account to a different user group and give all the permissions required to that group, or you can give these permissions explicitly to the scanning account.

| Devices to be scanned requirements | Description |
|:---|:---|
|Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Registry is enabled| To enable remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): </br> </br> - Verify the Windows Management Instrumentation service is running. </br> - Go to **Control Panel** &gt; **All Control Panel Items** &gt; **Windows Defender Firewall** &gt; **Allowed applications** and ensure Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is allowed through Windows Firewall.|
|Scanning account is a member of Performance Monitor Users group| The scanning account must be a member of the **Performance Monitor Users** group on the device to be scanned.|
|Performance Monitor Users group has 'Enable Account' and 'Remote Enable' permissions on Root/CIMV2 WMI namespace | To verify or enable these permissions: </br> </br> - Run wmimgmt.msc </br> - Right click **WMI Control (Local)** and select **Properties**</br> - Go to the Security tab</br> - Select the relevant WMI namespace and select **Security**</br> - Add the specified group and select to allow the specific permissions</br> - Select **Advanced**, choose the specified entry, and select **Edit**</br> - Set **Applies To** to “This namespace and subnamespaces”|
|**Performance Monitor Users** group should have permissions on DCOM operations| To verify or enable these permissions: </br></br> - Run dcomcnfg </br> - Navigate to **Component Services** > **Computers** > **My Computer** </br> - Right click My Computer and choose **Properties** </br> - Go to the COM Security tab </br> - Go to **Launch and Activation Permissions**  and select **Edit Limits** </br> - Add the specified group and select to allow **Remote Launch** and **Remote Activation** |

## Configure a new authenticated scan

To configure a new authenticated scan:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Device discovery** > **Authenticated scans** in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Add new scan** and choose **Windows authenticated scan** and select **Next**.

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/authenticated-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add new authenticated scan screen" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/authenticated-scan.png":::

3. Enter a **Scan name**.
4. Select the **Scanning device:** The onboarded device you'll use to scan the unmanaged devices.
5. Enter the **Target (range):** The IP address ranges or hostnames you want to scan. You can either enter the addresses or import a CSV file. Importing a file will override any manually added addresses.
6. Select the **Scan interval:** By default, the scan will run every four hours, you can change the scan interval or have it only run once, by selecting ‘Do not repeat’.
7. Choose your **Authentication method** - there are two options to choose from:  
    - Kerberos (preferred)
    - Negotiate

    >[!Note]
    > Negotiate option will fallback to NTLM in cases where Kerberos fails. Using NTLM is not recommended as it is not a secure protocol.

8. Enter the credentials Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management will use to remotely access the devices:

    - **Use azure KeyVault:** If you manage your credentials in Azure KeyVault you can enter the Azure KeyVault URL and Azure KeyVault secret name to be accessed by the scanning device to provide credentials
    - **Enter [gMSA account details](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview/):** Input the Domain and Username
9. Select **Next** to run or skip the test scan. For more information on test scans, see [Scan and add network devices](../defender-endpoint/network-devices.md#scan-and-add-network-devices).
10. Select **Next** to review the settings and then select **Submit** to create your new authenticated scan.

>[!Note]
>As the authenticated scanner currently uses an encryption algorithm that is not compliant with [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/system-cryptography-use-fips-compliant-algorithms-for-encryption-hashing-and-signing/), the scanner can't operate when an organization enforces the use of FIPS compliant algorithms.
>
> To allow algorithms that are not compliant with FIPS, set the following value in the registry for the devices where the scanner will run: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FipsAlgorithmPolicy with a DWORD value named **Enabled** and value of **0x0**
>
>FIPS compliant algorithms are only used in relation to departments and agencies of the United States federal government.

### Authenticated scan for Windows APIs

You can use APIs to create a new scan and view all existing configured scans in your organization. For more information, see:

- [Get all scan definitions](../defender-endpoint/get-all-scan-definitions.md)
- [Add, delete or update a scan definition](../defender-endpoint/add-a-new-scan-definition.md)
- [Get all scan agents](../defender-endpoint/get-all-scan-agents.md)
- [Get scan history by definition](../defender-endpoint/get-scan-history-by-definition.md)
- [Get scan history by session](../defender-endpoint/get-scan-history-by-session.md)
