# Fixed customer reported inaccuracies

The report inaccuracy capabilities provides a way to report false positive, inaccurate, or incomplete information identified in [Weaknesses](https://security.microsoft.com/vulnerabilities/cves) and [Recommendations](https://security.microsoft.com/security-recommendations) in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. Microsoft uses the information in reported inaccuracies to:

- Help update and correct the data for the organization that reported the inaccuracy
- As a basis to continue to improve our vulnerability management capabilities

You can use this article to find details on the inaccuracies that have been reported and are now fixed. The following tables present the fixed inaccuracies organized by month:
