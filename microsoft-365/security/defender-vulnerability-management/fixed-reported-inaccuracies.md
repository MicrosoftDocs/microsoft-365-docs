# Fixed customer reported inaccuracies

The report inaccuracy capabilities provides a way to report false positive, inaccurate, or incomplete information identified in [Weaknesses](https://security.microsoft.com/vulnerabilities/cves) and [Recommendations](https://security.microsoft.com/security-recommendations) in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. Microsoft uses the information in reported inaccuracies to:

- Help update and correct the data for the organization that reported the inaccuracy
- As a basis to continue to improve our vulnerability management capabilities
