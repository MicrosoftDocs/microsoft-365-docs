# Learn how to manage the Log4Shell vulnerability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The Log4Shell vulnerability is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability found in the Apache Log4j 2 logging library. As Apache Log4j 2 is commonly used by many software applications and online services, it represents a complex and high-risk situation for companies across the globe. Referred to as "Log4Shell" ([CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228), [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046)) it introduces a new attack vector that attackers can exploit to extract data and deploy ransomware in an organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the blogs [Guidance for preventing, detecting, and hunting for exploitation of the Log4j 2 vulnerability and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/) [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/) for guidance and technical information about the vulnerability and product specific mitigation recommendations to protect your organization.

## Overview of discovery, monitoring and mitigation capabilities

Defender Vulnerability Management provides you with the following capabilities to help you identify, monitor, and mitigate your organizational exposure to the Log4Shell vulnerability:

- **Discovery**: Detection of exposed devices, both Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarded devices as well as devices that have been discovered but are not yet onboarded, is based on vulnerable software and vulnerable files detected on disk.
- **Threat awareness:** A consolidated view to assess your organizational exposure. This view shows your exposure at the device level and software level, and provides access to details on vulnerable files like, the last time it was seen, the last time it was executed and the last time it was executed with open ports. You can use this information to prioritize your remediation actions. It can take up to 24 hours for data related to exposed devices to appear on the dashboard.
- **Mitigation options:** Apply mitigation options to help lower your exposure risk.
- **Advanced hunting:** Use advanced hunting to return details for vulnerable log4j files identified on disk.

> [!NOTE]
> These capabilities are supported on Windows 10 & Windows 11, Windows Server, Linux and macOS.
>
> Support on Linux requires Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Linux client version 101.52.57 (30.121092.15257.0) or later.
>
> Support on macOS requires Microsoft Defender for Endpoint macOS client version 20.121111.15416.0 or later.
>
> For more information on supported versions, see [Supported operating systems platforms and capabilities](tvm-supported-os.md).

## Exposed devices discovery

Embedded Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities, along with enabling Log4j detection, in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, will help you discover devices exposed to the Log4Shell vulnerability.

Onboarded devices, are assessed using existing embedded Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities that can discover vulnerable software and files.

For detection on discovered but not yet onboarded devices, Log4j detection must be enabled. This will initiate probes in the same way device discovery actively probes your network. This includes probing from multiple onboarded endpoints (Windows 10+ and Windows Server 2019+ devices) and only probing within subnets, to detect devices that are vulnerable and remotely exposed to CVE-2021-44228.

To enable Log4 detection:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Device discovery** > **Discovery setup**.
2. Select **Enable Log4j2 detection (CVE-2021-44228)**.
3. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="media/enable-log4j.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting to enable log4j2 detection." lightbox="media/enable-log4j.png":::

Running these probes will trigger the standard Log4j flow without causing any harmful impact on either the device being probed or the probing device. The probing itself is done by sending multiple HTTP requests to discovered devices, targeting common web application ports (for example - 80,8000,8080,443,8443) and URLs. The request contains HTTP headers with a JNDI payload that triggers a DNS request from the probed machine.

For example, User-Agent: ${jndi:dns://192.168.1.3:5353/MDEDiscoveryUser-Agent} where 192.168.1.3 is the IP of the probing machine.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Log4j2 detection also means onboarded devices will use self-probing to detect local vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerable software and files detection

Defender Vulnerability Management provides layers of detection to help you discover:

- **Vulnerable software**: Discovery is based on installed application Common Platform Enumerations (CPE) that are known to be vulnerable to Log4j remote code execution.
- **Vulnerable files:** Both files in memory and files in the file system are assessed. These files can be Log4j-core jar files with the known vulnerable version or an Uber-JAR that contains either a vulnerable jndi lookup class or a vulnerable log4j-core file. Specifically, it:

  - determines if a JAR file contains a vulnerable Log4j file by examining JAR files and searching for the following file:
      \\META-INF\\maven\\org.apache.logging.log4j\\log4j-core\\pom.properties - if this file exists, the Log4j version is read and extracted.
  - searches for the JndiLookup.class file inside the JAR file by looking for paths that contain the string "/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class" - if the JndiLookup.class file exists, Defender Vulnerability Management determines if this JAR contains a Log4j file with the version defined in pom.properties.
  - searches for any vulnerable Log4j-core JAR files embedded within a nested-JAR by searching for paths that contain any of these strings:
    - lib/log4j-core-
    - WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-
    - App-INF/lib/log4j-core-

This table describes the search capabilities supported platforms and versions:

|Capability|File Type|Windows10+,<br>server2019+|Server 2012R2,<br>server2016|Server 2008R2|Linux + macOS|
