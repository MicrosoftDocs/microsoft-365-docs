# Microsoft Virus Initiative

The Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) helps organizations develop better-together security solutions that are performant, reliable, and aligned with Microsoft technology and strategy.

## Become a member

> [!NOTE]
> The MVI Program is not currently accepting new applications for membership. Please contact MVI@microsoft.com for more information.

You can request membership if you're a representative for an organization that develops and produces antimalware or antivirus technology. 

To qualify for the MVI program, your organization must meet all the following requirements:

1. Your security solution either replaces or compliments Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

2. Your organization is responsible for both developing and distributing app updates to end-customers that address compatibility with Windows.

3. Your organization must be active in the antimalware industry and have a positive reputation, as evidenced by participation in industry conferences or being reviewed in an industry-standard report such as AV-Comparatives, OPSWAT, or Gartner.

4. Your organization must sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Microsoft.

5. Your organization must sign a program license agreement. Maintaining this license agreement requires that you adhere to all program requirements for antimalware apps. These requirements define the behavior of antimalware apps necessary to ensure proper interaction with Windows.

6. You must submit your app to Microsoft for periodic performance testing and feature review.

7. Your solution must be certified through independent testing by at least one industry-standard organization, and yearly certification must be maintained.
