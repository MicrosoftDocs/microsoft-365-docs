# Virus Information Alliance

The Virus Information Alliance (VIA) is a public anti-malware collaboration program for security software providers, security service providers, anti-malware testing organizations, and other organizations involved in fighting cyber crime.

Members of the VIA program collaborate by exchanging technical information on malicious software with Microsoft. The goal is to improve protection for Microsoft customers.

## Better protection for customers against malware

The VIA program gives members access to information that will help them improve protection. For example, the program provides malware telemetry and samples to security teams so they can identify gaps and prioritize new threat coverage.

Malware prevalence data is provided to anti-malware testers to assist them in selecting sample sets. The data also helps set scoring criteria that represent the real-world threat landscape. Service organizations, such as a CERT, can leverage our data to help assess the impact of policy changes or to help shut down malicious activity.

Microsoft is committed to continuous improvement to help reduce the impact of malware on customers. By sharing malware-related information, Microsoft enables members of this community to work towards better protection for customers.
