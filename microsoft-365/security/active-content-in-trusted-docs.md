# Manage active content in Office documents

> [!NOTE]
> The features that are described in this article are in Preview, aren't available to everyone, and are subject to change.

Office documents can be automatically refreshed, updated, or executed when they contain _active content_. Examples of active content are macros, ActiveX controls, and Office Add-ins. Active content can provide powerful and useful functionality to users, but attackers can also use active content to deliver malware.

Admins can create organization policies (group policies or cloud policies) that limit the use of active content to specific sets of users, or to disable active content entirely. Users can configure their own security and privacy settings in the Office Trust Center in their Office apps at **File** \> **Options** \> **Trust Center**.

Previously, when users identified documents as trusted documents, their selection would allow active content to run, even if an admin configured policies to block active content in Office documents. Now, policies set by admins take precedence over user identification of trusted documents. This change in behavior might cause issues for users.

The updated Trust Center logic is described in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="../media/office-trust-center-flow.png" alt-text="A flow chart describing Trust center Logic in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../media/office-trust-center-flow.png":::

1. A user opens an Office document that contains active content.

2. If the document is from a trusted location, the document is opened with the active content enabled. If the document is not from a trusted location, the evaluation continues.

3. It is here the updated behavior takes effect:
   - Previously, the next evaluated setting would have been if the user had identified this document as a trusted document. If they did, the document would open with the active content enabled.
   - Now, whether or not the user identified the document as a trusted document is not considered here (now at step 8).

     The fundamental change in behavior is described as follows: cloud policies (step 4), group policies (step 6), and local settings (step 7) are checked _before_ the user designation of a trusted document is even considered. If any of those steps block access to the active content **and** none of the steps allow user overrides, then user identification of the document as a trusted document is irrelevant.

4. Cloud policies are checked to see if this type of active content is allowed or blocked. If the active content is not blocked, the evaluation continues to step 6.

   If the active content is blocked by policy, the experience is described in step 5.

5. The opening of the document is blocked with a notification in the trust bar. What happens next is controlled by the user override settings in the policy:
   a. **User override not allowed**: The user can't open the document and the evaluation stops.
   b. **User override allowed**: The user can click the link in the trust bar to open the document with the active content enabled.

6. Group policies are checked to see if this type of active content is allowed or blocked. If the active content is not blocked, the evaluation continues to step 7.

   If the active content is blocked by policy, the experience is described in step 5.

7. Local settings are checked to see if this type of active content is allowed or blocked. If the active content is blocked, the opening of the document is blocked with a notification in the trust bar. If the active content is not blocked, the evaluation continues.

8. If the user previously identified the document as a trusted document, the document is opened with the active content enabled. If not, the opening of the document is blocked.

## What is a trusted document?

Trusted documents are Office documents that open without any security prompts for macros, ActiveX controls, and other types of active content in the document. Protected View or Application Guard is not used to open the document. When users open a Trusted Document, and all active content is enabled. Even if the document contains new active content or updates to existing active content, users won't receive security prompts the next time they open the document.

Because of this behavior, users should clearly trust documents only if they trust the document source.

If an admin blocks active content by using a policy, or if users set a Trust Center setting that blocks active content, the active content will remain blocked.

## Configure trusted document settings in Office policies

Admins have many ways to configure Office in an organization. For example:

- **Office cloud policy service**: Set up a user-based policy that applies to a user on any device accessing files in Office apps with their Azure AD account. See the steps for [creating an Office cloud policy configuration](/DeployOffice/overview-office-cloud-policy-service) in the [Office Cloud Policy Service](https://config.office.com/officeSettings/officePolicies).
- **Office policies in Intune**: Use the Intune Settings catalog or Administrative templates to deploy HKCU policies to Windows 10 PCs: In the [MEM admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/configurationProfiles) under **Devices** \> **Configuration Profiles**.
  - ***Administrative Templates***: See instructions to use Windows 10 templates to configure [Administrative Templates](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-windows).
  - ***Settings catalog (preview)***: See instructions to use the [Settings catalog (preview)](/mem/intune/configuration/settings-catalog).
- **Group policy**: Use your on-premise Active Directory to deploy group policy objects (GPOs) to users and computers. To create a GPO for this setting, download the latest [Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, and Office 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030).

## Known issues

- When the policy **VBA Macro notifications** (Access, PowerPoint, Visio, Word) or **Macro notifications** (Excel) is set to the value **Disable all except digitally signed macros**, the expected trust bar is not displayed, and **Security Information** in the backstage does not list details of macros blocked, even though the setting is working as expected. The Office team is working to resolve this issue.

## Admin options for restricting active content

There's a large difference in the level of trust in internally created content vs. content that users download from the internet. Consider allowing active content in internal documents and globally not allowing active content in documents from the internet.

If your users don't need specific types of active content, your most secure option is to use policies to turn off user access to that active content, and allow exceptions as needed.

The following policies are available:

- **Turn off Trusted Locations**: Exceptions for groups available.
- **Turn off Trusted Documents**: Exceptions for groups available.
- **Turn off all active content**: Exceptions for individuals.

The tables in the following sections describe the settings that control active content. These policies, if applied to users, will be enforced on trusted documents, and the previous end-user experience might not be the same. The tables also include the recommended security baselines setting, and identify other settings where the user prompt to override is available (allowing the user to enable the active content).
