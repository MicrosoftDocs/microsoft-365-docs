# Incidents overview in Microsoft Threat Protection

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection



The basis of all incidents are alerts. Alerts are created when a malicious event or activity is seen on your network. Individual alerts provide valuable clues in what's happening on individual events or entities. However, attacks typically employ various attack vectors to carry out a breach. Piecing individual clues together can be a challenging and time-consuming task. 

Microsoft Threat Protection connects the dots on individual alerts. Malicious events on the following entities are surfaced in the Microsoft 365 security center:
- Devices
- Users
- Mailboxes

Suspicious events that show characteristics of being part of a larger attack are aggregated into an incident. 

You'll know exactly where an attack started and other details to help you see the extent of the attack.

The platform provides security defenders with the right visuals and data representations to understand and address complex cross-entity threats. 

Not only will you have visibility on the scope of an attack, but you'll also have access to services that will allow you to take tactical steps to contain an incident.
