# Data monitoring and reporting in the Microsoft 365 security center

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


The **Data** category helps track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure. They are the rework of existing DLP policy reports plus a third-party DLP policy match report.

You can see:

- Users who share the most files from cloud apps
- How many DLP policy matches occurred
- How many DLP policies overrides or false positives are reported
- How many DLP policy matches happened in third-party cloud services via Microsoft Cloud App Security
