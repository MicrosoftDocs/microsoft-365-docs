# App monitoring and reporting in the Microsoft 365 security center

These reports provide more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization. Includes different kinds of apps, their level of risk, and alerts.

## Monitor email accounts at risk

## Monitor app permissions granted by users

**Cloud App Security - OAuth apps** lists apps discovered by Cloud App Security that have been granted permissions by users. Cloud App Security's risk catalog includes over 16,000 apps that are assessed using over 70 risk factors.

The risk factors start from general information, such as the app publisher. It then moves to security measures and controls, such as whether the app supports encryption at rest or provides an audit log of user activity.
