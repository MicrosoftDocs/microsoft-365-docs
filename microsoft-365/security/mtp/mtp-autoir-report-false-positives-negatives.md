# Handle false positives/negatives in automated investigation and response capabilities

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

False positives/negatives can occasionally occur with any threat protection solution. If [automated investigation and response capabilities](mtp-autoir.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender missed or wrongly detected something, there are steps your security operations team can take:

- [Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft](#report-a-false-positivenegative-to-microsoft-for-analysis);
- [Adjust your alerts](#adjust-an-alert-to-prevent-false-positives-from-recurring) (if needed); and 
- [Undo remediation actions that were taken on devices](#undo-a-remediation-action-that-was-taken-on-a-device). 

The following sections describe how to perform these tasks.

## Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft for analysis

## Undo a remediation action that was taken on a device

If a remediation action was taken on an entity (such as a device or an email message) and the affected entity is not actually a threat, your security operations team can undo the remediation action in the [Action center](mtp-action-center.md).

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. 
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**. 
3. On the **History** tab, select an action that you want to undo. Its flyout pane opens.
4. In the flyout pane, select **Undo**.

> [!TIP]
> See [Undo completed actions](mtp-autoir-actions.md#undo-completed-actions).
