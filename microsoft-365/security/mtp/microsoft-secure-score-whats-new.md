## Incompatibility with Identity Secure Score and Graph API

In the recent release of Microsoft Secure Score, an improved scoring model has been released. These changes allow for a more flexible and accurate view of your security posture. However, these updates have made Microsoft Secure Score temporarily incompatible with Identity Secure Score and the Graph API.

In time, Identity Secure Score and the Graph API will adopt the new scoring model. Until then, customers will see differences in the scores reported by Microsoft Secure Score, Identity Secure Score, and the Graph API. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes, and are working to ensure these experiences are more compatible in the future.

## Updated improvement actions

- Added Azure Active Directory improvement actions
- Added Azure Advanced Threat Protection improvement actions
- Support for Microsoft Defender ATP [Threat & Vulnerability Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) security recommendations
    - All released security recommendations supplied by TVM are now available

## Updated interface and functionality

* All new metrics and trends views for CISO and lead level discussions
* New ways to track and benchmark your score
* Better tracking and understanding for score regressions
