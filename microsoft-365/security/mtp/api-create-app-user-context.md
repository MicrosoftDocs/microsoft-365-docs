# Access Microsoft Threat Protection APIs on behalf of user

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.


This page describes how to create an application to get programmatic access to Microsoft Threat Protection on behalf of a user.

If you need programmatic access Microsoft Threat Protection without a user, refer to [Create an app to access Microsoft Threat Protection without a user](api-create-app-web.md).

If you are not sure which access you need, read the [Access the Microsoft Threat Protection APIs](api-access.md).

Microsoft Threat Protection exposes much of its data and actions through a set of programmatic APIs. Those APIs will enable you to automate work flows and innovate based on Microsoft Threat Protection capabilities. The API access requires OAuth2.0 authentication. For more information, see [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code).

In general, youâ€™ll need to take the following steps to use the APIs:
- Create an AAD application
- Get an access token using this application
- Use the token to access Microsoft Threat Protection API

This page explains how to create an AAD application, get an access token to Microsoft Threat Protection and validate the token.

>[!NOTE]
> When accessing Microsoft Threat Protection API on behalf of a user, you will need the correct Application permission and user permission.


>[!TIP]
> If you have the permission to perform an action in the portal, you have the permission to perform the action in the API.

## Create an app

1. Log on to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) with user that has **Global Administrator** role.

2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.

## Get an access token using PowerShell

```
#Install the ADAL.PS package if it's not installed.
if(!(Get-Package adal.ps)) { Install-Package -Name adal.ps }

$authority = "https://login.windows.net/{tenant-id}" # replace {tenant-id} with your tenant ID.

$clientId = "{application-id}" #replace {application-id} with your application ID.

$redirectUri = "{redirect-uri}" # replace {redirect-uri} with your application redirect URI.

$resourceUrl = "https://api.security.microsoft.com"

$response = Get-ADALToken -Resource $resourceUrl -ClientId $clientId -RedirectUri $redirectUri -Authority $authority -PromptBehavior:Always
$response.AccessToken | clip
$response.AccessToken
