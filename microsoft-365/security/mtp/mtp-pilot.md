# Run your pilot Microsoft Threat Protection project 

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

To effectively determine the benefit and adoption of Microsoft Threat Protection (MTP), you can run a pilot project. Before enabling Microsoft Threat Protection in your environment and starting with defined use cases, it is best to go through a planning process to determine the tasks that must be accomplished in this pilot project, and the success criteria. 


# How to use this pilot playbook

This guide provides an overview of Microsoft Threat Protection and step-by-step guidance on how to set up your pilot project.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For optimum results, follow the pilot instructions as closely as possible.


## Pilot playbook phases 

There are four phases in running a Microsoft Threat Protection pilot:

|Phase | Description | 
|:-------|:-----|
| ![Phase 1: Plan](../../media/prepare.png)<br>[Phase 1: Plan](mtp-pilot - plan.md)| Learn what you need to consider before running your Microsoft Threat Protection pilot project: <br><br>- Scope <br> - Use cases <br>- Requirements <br>- Test plan <br> - Success criteria <br> - Scorecard 
|  ![Phase 2: Prepare](../../media/setup.png) <br>[Phase 2: Prepare](mtp-evaluation.md)|  Access Microsoft 365 Security Center to setup your Microsoft Threat Protection pilot  environment. You will be guided to:<br><br>- Identify stakeholders and seek sign-off for your pilot <br> - Environment considerations <br>- Access <br>- Azure Active Directory setup <br> - Configuration order <br> - Sign up for Microsoft 365 E5 Trial <br> - Configure domain <br>- Assign Microsoft 365 E5 licenses <br> - Complete the setup wizard in the portal|
|  ![Phase 3: Run attack simulation](../../media/config-onboard.png) <br>[Phase 3: Run attack simulation]mtp-pilot - simulate.md) | To simulate an attack, you will be guided to:<br><br>- Prepare the test environment requirements <br>-  Run the simulation <br>- Investigate an incident <br>- resolve the incident 
|  ![Phase 4: Close and summarize](../../media/config-onboard.png) <br>[Phase 3: Close and summarize](mtp-pilot - close.md) | When you've reached the end of the process, you will be guided to:<br><br>- Go through your final output<br>- Present your output to your stakeholders <br>- Provide feedback <br>- Take next steps
