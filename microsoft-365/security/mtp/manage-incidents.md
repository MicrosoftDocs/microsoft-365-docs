# Manage incidents in Microsoft Threat Protection

Managing incidents is critical in ensuring that threats are contained and addressed. In Microsoft Threat Protection, you have access to managing incidents on endpoints, identities, and mailboxes. 


You can manage incidents by selecting an incident from the **Incidents queue**. 

You can edit the name of an incident, set its classification, resolve it, or assign the incident to yourself. 

## Edit incident name
By default, 
 
## Assign incidents
If an incident has not been assigned yet, you can select **Assign to me** to assign the incident to yourself. Doing so assumes ownership of not just the incident, but also all the alerts associated with it.

## Set status and classification
### Incident status
You can categorize incidents (as **Active**, or **Resolved**) by changing their status as your investigation progresses. This helps you organize and manage how your team can respond to incidents.

For example, your SOC analyst can review the urgent **Active** incidents for the day, and decide to assign them to herself for investigation.

Alternatively, your SOC analyst might set the incident as **Resolved** if the incident has been remediated. 

### Classification
You can choose not to set a classification, or decide to specify whether an incident is true or false. Doing so helps the team see patterns and learn from them.

### Add comments
You can add comments and view historical events about an incident to see previous changes made to it.

Whenever a change or comment is made to an alert, it is recorded in the Comments and history section.

Added comments instantly appear on the pane.
