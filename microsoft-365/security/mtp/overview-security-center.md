## Let's take a closer look

The **Home** page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user role. Because the Microsoft 365 security center uses role-based access control, different roles will see cards that are more meaningful to their day to day jobs.  

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. The Microsoft 365 security center brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

The Microsoft 365 security center includes:

* **Home** – Get at-a-glance view of the overall security health of your organization.
* **Incidents** - See the broader story of an attack by connecting the dots seen on individual alerts on entities. You'll know exactly where an attack started, what devices are impacted, who was affected, and where the threat has gone.
* **Alerts** – Have greater visibility into all the alerts across your Microsoft 365 environment. Includes alerts from Microsoft Cloud App Security, Office 365 ATP, Azure Active Directory, Azure ATP, and Microsoft Defender ATP. Available to E3 and E5 customers.  
* **Action center** - Reduce the volume of alerts your security team must address manually, allowing your security operations team to focus on more sophisticated threats and other high-value initiatives.
* **Reports** – Get the detail and information you need to better protect your users, devices, apps, and more.
* **Secure score** – Improve your overall security posture with Microsoft Secure Score. This page provides an all up summary of the different security features and capabilities you've enabled and includes recommendations for areas to improve.
* **Advanced hunting** – Proactively search for malware, suspicious files, and activities in your Microsoft 365 organization.
* **Classification** – Help protect data loss by adding labels to classify documents, email messages, documents, sites, and more. When a label is applied (automatically or by the user), the content or site is protected based on the settings you choose. For example, you can create labels that encrypt files, add content marking, and control user access to specific sites.
* **Policies** - Set up policies to manage devices, protect against threats, and receive alerts about various activities in your org.
* **Permissions** - Manage who in your organization has access to view content and perform tasks in the Microsoft 365 security center. You can also assign Microsoft 365 permissions in the Azure AD Portal.
