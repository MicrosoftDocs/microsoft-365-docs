# DeviceEvents

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection



The miscellaneous device events or `DeviceEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about various event types, including events triggered by security controls, such as Windows Defender Antivirus and exploit protection. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

>[!TIP]
> For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the [built-in schema reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md?#get-schema-information-in-the-security-center) available in the security center.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).

| `InitiatingProcessSHA1` | string | SHA-1 of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessSHA256` | string | SHA-256 of the process (image file) that initiated the event. This field is usually not populated — use the SHA1 column when available. |
