# Remediation actions following automated investigations in Microsoft Threat Protection

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection


## Remediation actions

During and after an automated investigation in Microsoft Threat Protection, remediation actions are identified for malicious or suspicious items. Some kinds of remediation actions are taken on devices, also referred to as endpoints. Other remediation actions are taken on email content. Automated investigations complete after remediation actions are taken, approved, or rejected.

The following table summarizes remediation actions that are currently supported in Microsoft Threat Protection: 

|Device (endpoint) remediation actions  |Email remediation actions  |
|---------|---------|
|- Collect investigation package <br/>- Isolate device (this action can be undone)<br/>- Offboard machine <br/>- Release code execution <br/>- Release from quarantine <br/>- Request sample <br/>- Restrict code execution (this action can be undone) <br/>- Run antivirus scan <br/>- Stop and quarantine      |- Block URL (time-of-click)<br/>- Soft delete email messages or clusters<br/>- Quarantine email<br/>- Quarantine an email attachment<br/>- Turn off external mail forwarding          |

Remediation actions, whether they're pending approval or are already complete, can be viewed in the [Action Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/mtp-action-center).

## Remediation actions follow automated investigations

When an automated investigation completes, a verdict is reached for every piece of evidence involved, and remediation actions are identified. In some cases, remediation actions are taken automatically; in other cases, remediation actions await approval. The following table lists possible verdicts and outcomes:

|Verdict    |Area    |Outcomes|
|------|------|------|
|Malicious    |Devices (endpoints)    |Remediation actions are taken automatically|
|Malicious    |Email content (URLs or attachments) | Recommended remediation actions are pending approval|
|Suspicious    |Devices or email content |Recommended remediation actions are pending approval|
|No threats found    |Devices or email content    |No remediation actions are needed|
