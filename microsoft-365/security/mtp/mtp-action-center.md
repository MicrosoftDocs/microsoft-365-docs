# The Action center in Microsoft Threat Protection

In Microsoft Threat Protection, the Action center provides a view of current and past investigations across identities, devices, and mailboxes. This not only enables your security operations team to operate more effectively and efficiently, it also provides a more comprehensive view of Microsoft Threat Protection at work for your organization. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, security administrator, security operator, or security reader to perform the tasks described in this article. To learn more, see [Microsoft 365 security center: roles and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/microsoft-security-and-compliance#required-licenses-and-permissions).

## Visit the Action center

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. 

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**. 

3. In the Action center, you’ll see two tabs: **Pending** and **History**.

    - The **Pending** tab lists investigations that require review and approval by someone in your security operations team to proceed. Make sure to review and take action on pending items you see here.

    - The **History** tab lists past investigations as well as remediation actions that were taken automatically. You can view data for the past day, week, month, or six months.

4. To show only the columns you want to see, select **Customize columns**.<br/>![Action Center in Microsoft Threat Protection](../images/mtp-action-center.png)
