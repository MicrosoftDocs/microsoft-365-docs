# Get incident notifications by email

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

You can set up Microsoft 365 Defender to notify you by email every time there are new incidents or new updates to existing incidents. 

You can choose to get notifications based on incident severity or by device group. You can also choose to get a notification only on the first update per incident.

You can add or remove recipients in the email notifications. Newly added recipients get notified about incidents after they're added. 

The email notification contains important details about the incident like the incident name, severity, and categories, among others. You can also directly go to incidents so you can start your investigation right away. For more on investigating incidents, see [Investigate incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender](./investigate-incidents.md).

>[!NOTE]
>You need 'Manage security settings' permissions to configure email notification settings. If you've chosen to use basic permissions management, users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator roles can configure email notifications for you. <br> <br>
Likewise, if your organization is using role-based access control (RBAC), you can only create, edit, delete, and receive notifications based on device groups that you are allowed to manage.

## Create rules for incident notifications

To set up your first email notification for incidents, create a new rule and customize email notification settings.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Incident email notifications**.
2. Select **Add item**.
3. Give the rule a name in **Name** and supply a **Description**.

4. Select **Next** to go to **Notification settings**. Here you can specify:
    - **Alert severity** - Choose the alert severity that will trigger an incident notification. For example, if you only want to be informed about High severity incidents, select High.
    - **Device group scope** - This dropdown displays all the device groups the user can access. Select which device groups you're creating the incident notification rules for.
    - **Only notify on first occurrence per incident** - Selecting this option will send an email notification only on the first alert that matches your other selections. Later updates or alerts related to the incident won't trigger a notification.
    - **Include organization name** - Indicates whether the customer name appears on the email notification or not.
    - **Include tenant-specific portal link** -  Adds a link with the tenant ID to allow access to a specific tenant.

6. Finally, select **Next** to go to **Review rule** so you can see all the settings associated with your new rule. Recipients will start receiving incident notifications through email based on the settings.
