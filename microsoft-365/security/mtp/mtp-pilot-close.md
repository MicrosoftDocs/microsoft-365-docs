You're currently in the closing and summarizing phase.

You’ve just ran an advanced memory-only attack simulation that executed code remotely on a domain controller. You’ve seen how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Identity detect and create alerts on stealthy malicious activity. You’ve also seen how alerts from different sources are delivered along with other contextual information into a single incident in the Microsoft 365 Security Center portal. Experiencing such integration enables SOC analysts to investigate and take necessary action. You’ve also created an advanced hunting query that will identify inbound emails where the user opened or saved the attachment and created detection based on that query.

You’ve reached the end of the process after all tests have concluded.

The final output should be:

- A completed scorecard
- A detailed report of the findings of the pilot
- A decision on how to move forward

Present the reports from your final output to internal stakeholders (which you’ve identified during the [preparation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/prepare-mtpeval) phase) and Microsoft contacts. Such an effort ensures that any feedback can be used to improve products and documentation.

We hope you enjoyed this simulation. Start implementing what you've learned on a larger scale in your organization to get the most out of the integrated security solution.
