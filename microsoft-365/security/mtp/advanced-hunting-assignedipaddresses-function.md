# AssignedIPAddresses()

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

Use the `AssignedIPAddresses()` function to quickly obtain the latest IP addresses that have been assigned to a device or the most recent IP addresses from a specified point in time. This function returns a table with the following columns:

| Column | Data type | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Timestamp | datetime | Latest time when the device was observed using the IP address |
| IPAddress | string | IP address used by the device |
| IPType | string | Indicates whether the IP address is a public or private address |
| NetworkAdapterType | int | Network adapter type used by the device that has been assigned the IP address. For the possible values, refer to [this enumeration](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.networkinformation.networkinterfacetype?view=netframework-4.7.2)  |
| ConnectedNetworks | int | Networks that the adapter with the assigned IP address is connected to. Each JSON array contains the network name, category (public, private or domain), a description, and a flag indicating if it's connected publicly to the internet |


## Syntax

```kusto
AssignedIPAddresses(x, y)
```

## Arguments

- **x** — `DeviceId` or `DeviceName` value identifying the device
- **y** — `Timestamp` (datetime) value indicating the specific point in time where to get the most recent IP addresses. If not specified, the function returns the latest IP addresses.

## Examples

### Get the list of IP addresses used by a device as of 24 hours ago

```kusto
AssignedIPAddresses('example-device-name', ago(1d))
```

### Get IP addresses used by a device and find devices communicating with it
This query uses the `AssignedIPAddresses()` function to get assigned IP addresses for the device (`example-device-name`) on or before a specific date (`example-date`). It then uses the IP addresses to find connections to the device initiated by other devices. 

```kusto
let Date = datetime(example-date);
let DeviceName = "example-device-name";
// List IP addresses used on or before the specified date
AssignedIPAddresses(DeviceName, Date)
| project DeviceName, IPAddress, AssignedTime = Timestamp 
// Get all network events on devices with the assigned IP addresses as the destination addresses
| join kind=inner DeviceNetworkEvents on $left.IPAddress == $right.RemoteIP
// Get only network events around the time the IP address was assigned
| where Timestamp between ((AssignedTime - 1h) .. (AssignedTime + 1h))
```
