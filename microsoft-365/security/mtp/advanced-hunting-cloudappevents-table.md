# CloudAppEvents

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender



The `CloudAppEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about activities in various cloud apps and services covered by Microsoft Cloud App Security, specifically Dropbox, Exchange Online, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This table includes information that used to be available in the `AppFileEvents` table. Starting March 7, 2021, users hunting through file-related activities in cloud services on and beyond this date should use the `CloudAppEvents` table instead. <br><br>Make sure to search for queries and custom detection rules that still use the `AppFileEvents` table and edit them to use the `CloudAppEvents` table. More guidance about converting affected queries can be found in [Hunt across cloud app activities with Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender/hunt-across-cloud-app-activities-with-microsoft-365-defender/ba-p/1893857).
