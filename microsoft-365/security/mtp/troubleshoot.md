# Troubleshoot Microsoft 365 Defender service issues

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

This section addresses issues that might arise as you use the Microsoft 365 Defender service.

## I don't see Microsoft 365 Defender content

If you don't see capabilities on the navigation pane such as the Incidents, Action Center, or Hunting in your portal, you'll need to verify that your tenant has the appropriate licenses.

For more information, see [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

## Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts are not showing up in the Microsoft 365 Defender incidents

If you have Microsoft Defender for Identity deployed in your environment but you're not seeing Defender for Identity alerts as part of Microsoft 365 Defender incidents, you'll need to ensure that the Microsoft Cloud App Security and Defender for Identity integration is enabled.

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity integration](/cloud-app-security/mdi-integration).

## Where is the settings page for turning the service on?

To turn on Microsoft 365 Defender, access **Settings** from the navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 security center. This navigation item is visible only if you have the [prerequisite permissions and licenses](mtp-enable.md#check-license-eligibility-and-required-permissions).
