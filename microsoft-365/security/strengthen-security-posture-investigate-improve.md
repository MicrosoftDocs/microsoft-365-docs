# Strengthen your security posture - Investigate and improve

Welcome to Phase 3 of [Strengthen your security posture](../security/security-posture-solution-overview.md): **Investigate and improve**.

You're given points for taking actions and your score is updated to reflect the actions you take.|[Secure Score Overview](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.md) <br /><br /> [Check your score](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score-improvement-actions.md#check-your-current-score)|
|**Take Secure Score recommended actions** | Review the recommended actions tab for a list of improvement actions you can take to strengthen your posture and improve your score.
