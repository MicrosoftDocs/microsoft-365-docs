# Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business

If you want to offboard a device, use one of the following procedures:

- [Offboard a Windows device](#offboard-a-windows-device)
- [Offboard a Mac](#offboard-a-mac)

## Offboard a Windows device

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**, and then choose **Endpoints**.

3. Under **Device management**, choose **Offboarding**.

4. Select an operating system, such as **Windows 10 and 11**, and then, under **Offboard a device**, in the **Deployment method** section, choose **Local script**. 

5. In the confirmation screen, review the information, and then choose **Download** to proceed.

6. Select **Download offboarding package**. We recommend saving the offboarding package to a removable drive.

7. Run the script on each device that you want to offboard.

## Offboard a Mac

1. Go to **Finder** > **Applications**. 

2. Right click on **Microsoft Defender for Business**, and then choose **Move to Trash**. <br/>--- or --- <br/> Use the following command: `sudo '/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Defender/uninstall/uninstall'`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Offboarding a device causes the devices to stop sending data to Defender for Business. However, data received prior to offboarding is retained for up to six (6) months.
