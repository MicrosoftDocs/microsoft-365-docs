# Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business

As devices are replaced or retired, or your business needs change, you can offboard devices from Defender for Business. Offboarding a device causes the device to stop sending data to Defender for Business. However, data received prior to offboarding is retained for up to six (6) months.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The procedures in this article describe how to remove a device from monitoring by Defender for Business. If you're using Microsoft Intune to manage devices, and you prefer to remove the device from Intune, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](/mem/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe).

## What to do

1. Select a tab:

   - **Windows 10 or 11**
   - **Mac**
   - **Servers** (Windows Server or Linux Server)
   - **Mobile** (for iOS/iPadOS or Android devices)

2. Follow the guidance on the selected tab.
3. Proceed to your next steps.
