  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: I have another Microsoft Cloud subscription. Why am I not seeing Microsoft Defender for Business in my portal?
        answer: |
          Currently, whenever a customer has multiple subscriptions, the highest subscription takes precedence. Here are some examples:
          
          - Example 1: If you have [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2) (purchased or trial subscription), and you get Microsoft Defender for Business, Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 takes precedence. In this case, you won't see the Defender for Business experience.

          - Example 2: If you have [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) (purchased or trial subscription), and you get Defender for Business, Defender for Cloud takes precedence. In this case, you won't see the Defender for Business experience.

      - question: What are the differences between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plans 1 and 2?
        answer: |
          Defender for Business was designed for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). With a [simplified configuration process](mdb-simplified-configuration.md) and [device onboarding options](mdb-onboard-devices.md), Defender for Business enables customers who do not necessarily have a security background to set up, configure, and use Defender for Business.  
          
          Both Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint provide strong threat protection capabilities for your company's endpoints. To learn more about the differences, see [Compare Microsoft Defender for Business to Microsoft 365 Business Premium](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md).

      - question: How do I sign up for the preview of Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Defender for Business is rolling out as part of Microsoft 365 Business Premium, beginning March 1, 2022. If you have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you'll soon have Defender for Business capabilities automatically.

          The standalone version of Defender for Business is still in preview. Visit [https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview) to apply for the preview program. To learn more, see [How to get Microsoft Defender for Business](get-defender-business.md).

      - question: Are there any prerequisites for Defender for Business preview?
        answer: |
          Your company should be one of the following:

          - A partner who offers IT services to small and medium-sized businesses
          
          - A small or medium-sized business with up to 300 employees

          You don't already have to have another Microsoft 365 subscription. To learn more, see [Microsoft Defender for Business requirements](mdb-requirements.md).

      - question: What will the licensing model be at GA?
        answer: |
          Beginning March 1, 2022, Defender for Business is rolling out as part of Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Defender for Business is reaching general availability (GA) now for Microsoft 365 Business Premium customers.

          For customers who don't have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Defender for Business is an option as a standalone plan. The standalone version of Defender for Business is still in preview, and will reach GA later this calendar year.

      - question: If I'm already using Microsoft 365 Business Premium, why do I need Defender for Business?
        answer: |
           Microsoft 365 Business Premium currently includes device management capabilities, Defender for Office 365 Plan 1, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus, next-generation protection for Windows devices. Defender for Business extends these capabilities by adding increased security for your company's devices. To learn more, see the following articles:

      - question: What happens to the preview of Defender for Business if the preview trial offer expires before Defender for Business reaches general availability (GA)?
        answer: |
           Microsoft partners can extend preview trial licenses up to the point of GA. Once GA is complete, the preview trial won't be extended.
           
      - question: What happens if a customer has 20 users with a mix of subscriptions? For example, suppose they have 10 users assigned a Defender for Business license and 10 users assigned a Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 license?
        answer: |
           Mixed licenses are currently not supported, We don't currently support mixed licenses. The highest functional license sets the experience for the tenant. Using our example, the tenant experience will be Defender for Endpoint Plan 2, and will require 20 Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 licenses. 
           
      - question: Can I configure more than one web content filtering policy in Defender for Business?
        answer: |
           Currently, Defender for Business supports only one uniform web filtering policy per Defender for Business tenant. 

      - question: How can I run custom reports with Defender for Business?
        answer: |
           Defender for Business currently includes a set of APIs to support robust custom reporting, and a Power BI connector. You could schedule a PowerShell script to generate executive summaries formatted in HTML, and send those summaries via email.

      - question: I'm a Microsoft partner. Will I be able to manage multiple tenants from one control panel, or will I have to sign in to each tenant individually? 
        answer: |
           Defender for Business is enabled in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for multi-tenant support in a single console. Currently, a multi-tenant incident queue provides you with a cross-tenant view of incidents that require attention; however, configuration and onboarding are done in the customer's tenant using your partner credentials. More integration scenarios are planned.

      - question: How do I configure attack surface reduction rules and capabilities in Defender for Business?
        answer: |
           Simplified configuration for attack surface reduction rules and capabilities via Defender for Business in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) isn't supported yet. If you have Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can use Endpoint Manager to configure your attack surface reduction policies. 

      - question: If I do not currently have Microsoft Endpoint Manager, do I need an additional license to use features that are included in both Defender for Business and Endpoint Manager? 
        answer: |
           If you have Defender for Business as a standalone subscription and you do not have Microsoft Intune (part of Endpoint Manager), you can manage Windows devices in Defender for Business by using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). You can also manage your next-generation protection and firewall protection policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal with a [simplified configuration experience](mdb-simplified-configuration.md). To manage other settings, such as attack surface reduction policies, or to onboard some devices (such as Android devices), you'll need Endpoint Manager.
