# Assign security roles and permissions in Microsoft Defender for Business

This article describes how to assign security roles and permissions in Defender for Business.

:::image type="content" source="media/mdb-setup-step3.png" alt-text="Visual depicting step 3 - assign security roles and permissions in Defender for Business.":::

Your organization's security team needs certain permissions to perform tasks, such as

- Configuring Defender for Business
- Onboarding (or removing) devices
- Viewing reports about devices and threat detections
- Viewing incidents and alerts
- Taking response actions on detected threats

Permissions are granted through certain roles in the [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal). These roles can be assigned in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## What to do

1. [Learn about roles in Defender for Business](#roles-in-defender-for-business).
2. [View or edit role assignments for your security team](#view-and-edit-role-assignments).
3. [Proceed to your next steps](#next-steps).


## Roles in Defender for Business

The following table describes the three roles that can be assigned in Defender for Business. [Learn more about admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

| Permission level | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Global administrators** (also referred to as global admins) <br/><br/> *As a best practice, limit the number of global admins. See [Security guidelines for assigning roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles#security-guidelines-for-assigning-roles).* | Global admins can perform all kinds of tasks. The person who signed up your company for Microsoft 365 or for Defender for Business is a global administrator by default. Global admins typically complete the setup and configuration process in Defender for Business, including onboarding devices.<br/><br/> Global admins are able to modify settings across all Microsoft 365 portals, such as: <br/>- The Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com))<br/>- Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) |
| **Security administrators** (also referred to as security admins) | Security admins can perform the following tasks: <br/>- View and manage security policies<br/>- View, respond to, and manage alerts <br/>- Take response actions on devices with detected threats<br/>- View security information and reports <br/><br/>In general, security admins use the Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) to perform security tasks. |
| **Security reader** | Security readers can perform the following tasks:<br/>- View a list of onboarded devices<br/>- View security policies<br/>- View alerts and detected threats<br/>- View security information and reports <br/><br/>Security readers can't add or edit security policies, nor can they onboard devices. |

## View and edit role assignments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you grant people access to only what they need to perform their tasks. We call this concept *least privilege* for permissions. To learn more, see [Best practices for least-privileged access for applications](/azure/active-directory/develop/secure-least-privileged-access). 

You can use the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Microsoft Entra admin center to view and edit role assignments.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) and sign in. 

2. In the navigation pane, go to **Users** > **Active users**.

3. Select a user account to open their flyout pane.
