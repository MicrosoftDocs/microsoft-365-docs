# The simplified configuration process in Microsoft Defender for Business

Microsoft Defender for Business features a simplified configuration process, designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses. This experience takes the guesswork out of onboarding and managing devices, with a wizard-like experience and default policies that are designed to protect your company's devices from day one. **We recommend using the simplified configuration process; however, you're not limited to this option**.

When it comes to onboarding devices and configuring security settings for your company's devices, you can choose from several experiences: 

- The simplified configuration process in Microsoft Defender for Business (*recommended*) 
- Microsoft Intune (included in [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md))

## Review your setup and configuration options

The following table describes each experience:

| Portal experience  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| The simplified configuration experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <br/>(*This is the recommended option for most customers*)  | The simplified configuration experience includes a wizard-like experience to help you set up and configure Defender for Business. To learn more, see [Use the wizard to set up Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-use-wizard.md).<br/><br/>Simplified configuration also includes default security settings and policies to help you protect your company's devices as soon as they are onboarded to Defender for Business. You can view your default policies, and if necessary, edit your policies to suit your business needs. To learn more, see [View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-view-edit-policies.md).<br/><br/>With the simplified experience, your security team uses the Microsoft 365 Defender portal as a one-stop shop to: <br/>- Set up and configure Defender for Business <br/>- View and manage incidents<br/>- Respond to and mitigate threats<br/>- View reports<br/>- Review pending or completed actions  |
| The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com))  | Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for apps and devices. Intune is not included in the standalone version of Defender for Business; however, [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md) includes Intune.<br/><br/>If you're already using Intune, you can use the Endpoint Manager admin center to manage devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. See [Microsoft Intune: Device management](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-device-management). |
