## Review your setup and configuration options

The following table describes each experience:
<br/><br/>

| Portal experience  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| The simplified configuration experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <br/>(*This is the recommended option for most customers*)  | The simplified configuration experience includes a wizard-like experience to help you set up and configure Defender for Business. Simplified configuration also includes default security settings and policies to help you protect your company's devices as soon as they are onboarded to Defender for Business. <br/><br/>With this experience, your security team uses the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to: <br/>- Set up and configure Defender for Business <br/>- View and manage incidents<br/>- Respond to and mitigate threats<br/>- View reports<br/>- Review pending or completed actions <br/><br/> The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is your one-stop shop for your company's security settings and threat protection capabilities.

To learn more, see [Use the wizard to set up Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-use-wizard.md).<br/><br/>And, you can edit your settings or define new policies to suit your company's needs.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-view-edit-policies.md). |
| The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com))  | Microsoft Endpoint Manager includes Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for apps and devices. [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md) customers already have Endpoint Manager. <br/><br/>Many companies use Intune to manage their devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. To learn more, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune). <br/><br/>If you're already using Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can continue using that solution. |
| Your non-Microsoft device management solution  | If you're using a non-Microsoft productivity and device management solution, you can continue to use that solution with Defender for Business. <br/><br/>When devices are onboarded to Defender for Business, you'll see their status and alerts in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. To learn more, see [Onboarding and configuration tool options for Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/onboard-configure.md). |
