Microsoft Defender for Business (preview) features a simplified configuration process, designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses.

## Review your setup and configuration options

The following table describes each experience:
<br/><br/>

| Portal experience  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| The simplified configuration experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <br/>(*This is the recommended option for most customers*)  | The simplified configuration experience includes default security settings and policies that help you protect your organization's devices from day one. With this experience, your security team uses the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to: <br/>- Set up and configure Defender for Business (preview) <br/>- View and manage incidents<br/>- Respond to and mitigate threats<br/>- View reports<br/>- Review pending or completed actions <br/><br/> This portal is your one-stop shop for your organization's security settings and threat protection capabilities. You get a simplified experience to help you get started quickly and efficiently.  And, you can edit your settings or define new policies to suit your organization's needs.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-view-edit-policies.md). |
| The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com))  | Microsoft Endpoint Manager includes Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for apps and devices. <br/><br/>Many organizations use Intune to manage their devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. To learn more, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune). <br/><br/>If you're already using Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can continue using that solution. |
| Your non-Microsoft device management solution  | If you're using a non-Microsoft productivity and device management solution, such as Jamf for macOS or Ansible for Linux, you can continue to use that solution with Defender for Business (preview). <br/><br/>When devices are onboarded to Defender for Business (preview), you'll see their status and alerts in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. To learn more, see [Onboarding and configuration tool options for Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/onboard-configure.md).<br/><br/>If you're already using a non-Microsoft device management solution, you can continue using that solution. |
