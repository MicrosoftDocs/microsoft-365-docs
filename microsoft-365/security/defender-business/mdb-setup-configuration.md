# Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for business

As a preview customer, you likely have assistance in setting up Microsoft Defender for business for your company. However, you can do the setup and configuration process yourself as well. Use this article as a guide.

## Setup and configuration process

| Step  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| [1. Review the requirements](mdb-requirements.md)     | View the license, software, and other requirements for Microsoft Defender for business. See [Microsoft Defender for business requirements](mdb-requirements.md).        |

| [3. Assign roles and permissions](mdb-roles-permissions.md)     | People on your security team need permissions to perform tasks, such as reviewing detected threats & remediation actions, viewing & editing policies, onboarding devices, and using reports. You can grant these permissions through certain roles. See [Assign roles and permissions](mdb-roles-permissions.md).        |
| [4. Choose your portal](mdb-choose-portal.md)     | You can choose to manage Microsoft Defender for business in one of two portals. (We recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.) See [Choose where to manage your policies and settings](mdb-choose-portal.md).        |

| [6. View or edit device policies](mdb-view-edit-device-policies.md)     | Your company's devices are managed through device policies. Default policies are included in Microsoft Defender for business; however, you can edit those policies or define new policies to suit your company's needs. See [View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for business](mdb-view-edit-device-policies.md).         |
