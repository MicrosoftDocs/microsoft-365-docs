# Visit the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) is your one-stop shop for using and managing Microsoft Defender for Business. It includes callouts to help you get started, cards that surface relevant information, and a navigation bar to give you easy access to various features and capabilities.

## The navigation bar

Use the navigation bar on the left side of the screen to access your incidents, view reports, and manage your security policies. The following table describes items you'll see in your navigation bar.

| Item | Description |

The home page highlights any active threats that are detected, along with recommendations to help secure your company's data and devices. Recommendations are included in Defender for Business to save your security team time and effort. The recommendations are based on industry best practices. To learn more, see [Security recommendations - threat and vulnerability management](../defender-endpoint/tvm-security-recommendation.md). |
| **Incidents** | Takes you to your list of recent incidents. As alerts are triggered, incidents are created. An incident can include multiple alerts. Make sure to review your incidents regularly.

| **Actions & submissions** > **Action center** | Takes you to your list of response actions, including completed and pending actions.<ul><li>Select the **History** tab to see the actions that were taken. Some actions are taken automatically; others are taken manually or complete after they're approved.</li><li>Select the **Pending** tab to view actions that require approval to proceed.</li></ul><br/>To learn more, see [Review remediation actions in the Action center](mdb-review-remediation-actions.md). |

| **Threat analytics** | Takes you to a view of current threats, and provides an at-a-glance view of your threat landscape. Threat analytics also includes reports and information from Microsoft security researchers. To learn more, see [Track and respond to emerging threats through threat analytics](../defender-endpoint/threat-analytics.md). |
| **Secure score** | Provides a representation of your company's security position and offers suggestions to improve it. To learn more, see [Microsoft Secure Score for Devices](../defender-endpoint/tvm-microsoft-secure-score-devices.md). |
| **Learning hub** | Provides access to security training and other resources through learning paths that are included with your subscription. You can filter by product, skill level, role, and more. The Learning hub can help your security team ramp up on security features and capabilities in Defender for Business and more Microsoft offerings, such as [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](../office-365-security/defender-for-office-365.md).  |

| **Reports** | Lists available security reports. These reports enable you to see your security trends, view details about threat detections and alerts, and learn more about your company's vulnerable devices. |
| **Health** | Enables you to view your service health status and plan for upcoming changes. <ul><li>Select **Service health** to view the health status of the Microsoft 365 services that are included in your company's subscription.</li><li>Select **Message center** to learn about planned changes and what to expect.</li></ul>  |
| **Permissions** | Enables you to assign permissions to the people in your company who manage your security and to view incidents and reports in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. Also enables you to set up and manage device groups to onboard your company's devices and assign threat protection policies.  |
| **Settings** | Enables you to edit settings for the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and Defender for Business. For example, you can onboard (or offboard) your company's devices (also referred to as endpoints). You can also define rules, such as alert-suppression rules, and set up indicators to block or allow certain files or processes.  |
| **More resources** | Navigate to other portals, such as Azure Active Directory. But keep in mind that the Microsoft 365 Defender portal should meet your needs without requiring you to navigate to other portals. |
