## Microsoft Defender for Business integrates with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

If you're a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you have [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview.md), you can manage security for your customers (small and medium-sized businesses). Microsoft Defender for Business (preview) is designed to integrate with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. When these capabilities become available, you'll be able to view security incidents across tenants in your Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal ([https://lighthouse.microsoft.com](https://lighthouse.microsoft.com)).
