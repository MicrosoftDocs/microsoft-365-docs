# Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and Microsoft Defender for Business

## Microsoft Defender for Business integrates with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

If you're a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you have [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview.md), you can manage security for your customers (small and medium-sized businesses). Microsoft Defender for Business is designed to integrate with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. When these capabilities become available, you'll be able to view security incidents across tenants in your Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal ([https://lighthouse.microsoft.com](https://lighthouse.microsoft.com)).

To access the list of incidents, in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, on the home page, find the **Security incidents** card, and then select **View all incidents**.
