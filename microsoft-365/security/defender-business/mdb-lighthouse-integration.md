# Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and Microsoft Defender for Business

## Microsoft Defender for Business integrates with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

If you're a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you have [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview.md), you can manage security for your customers (small and medium-sized businesses). Microsoft Defender for Business is designed to integrate with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, so that you can view security incidents across tenants in your Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal ([https://lighthouse.microsoft.com](https://lighthouse.microsoft.com)).

To access the list of incidents, in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, on the home page, find the **Security incidents** card, and then select **View all incidents**.
