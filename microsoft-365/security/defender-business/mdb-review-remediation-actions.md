As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play. Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval. Examples of remediation actions include sending a file to quarantine, stopping a process from running, and removing a scheduled task. All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.
