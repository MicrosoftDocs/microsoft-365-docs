# Microsoft Defender for Business and managed service provider resources

As you already know, most managed service providers (MSPs) offer a sophisticated stack of capabilities. For example, many MSPs offer software and services that include backup & recovery, network management, line of business apps, and cybersecurity capabilities. Small and medium-sized businesses recognize security as a key component to their success, but often don't have the capacity or expertise to have a dedicated security operations team. These customers often need help with managing the security of their endpoints and network, and addressing alerts or detected threats.

If you're a Microsoft MSP, Defender for Business (and Microsoft 365 Business Premium) can help you build your cybersecurity stack. You can integrate Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and professional service automation (PSA) software.

## Use APIs to integrate with your MSP solution

Using our APIs for custom integration, you can:

- Get access to your customers' Microsoft 365 Defender portal​ to [address alerts and incidents](mdb-respond-mitigate-threats.md).
- Get [email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md)​ about new alerts or vulnerabilities across your customers' tenants.
- Fetch and view [incidents and alerts](mdb-view-manage-incidents.md) with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.​ 
- Orchestrate [remediation actions](mdb-review-remediation-actions.md), such as approving actions following automated investigations, or taking manual response actions on a device.
