# Resources for Microsoft partners using Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium

Small and medium-sized businesses recognize security as a key component to their success, but often don't have the capacity or expertise to have a dedicated security operations team. Customers often need help with managing the security of their endpoints and network, and addressing alerts or detected threats. Microsoft partners can help!

If you're a Microsoft partner, and you're working with customers who have or need [Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md), [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md), or [Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint.md), this article is for you.

## Integrate Microsoft endpoint security with your RMM tools and PSA software

If you're a Microsoft Managed Service Provider (MSP), you can integrate Microsoft endpoint security with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and your professional service automation (PSA) software so that you can: 

- Get access to your customers' Microsoft 365 Defender portal to [address detected threats and incidents](mdb-respond-mitigate-threats.md).
- Get [email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md) about new alerts or vulnerabilities across your customers' tenants.
- Fetch and view [incidents and alerts](mdb-view-manage-incidents.md) with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Orchestrate [remediation actions](mdb-review-remediation-actions.md), such as approving actions following automated investigations, or taking manual response actions on a device.

Integration can be done by using the [Defender for Endpoint APIs](../defender-endpoint/management-apis.md). Use the following resources to learn more:
