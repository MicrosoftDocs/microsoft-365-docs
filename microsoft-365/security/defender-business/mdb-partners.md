# Resources for Microsoft partners working with small and medium-sized businesses

> [!TIP]
> **Read all about exciting, new capabilities releasing in July 2023 in the [Tech Community blog: New SMB security innovations from Microsoft Inspire 2023](https://aka.ms/SMBSecurityJulyBlog)**.

Small and medium-sized businesses recognize that security is important, but they often don't have the capacity or expertise to have a dedicated security operations team. These customers often need help with setup and configuration, managing security for their devices and network, and addressing alerts or detected threats. Microsoft partners can help!

If you're a Microsoft partner, and you're working with customers who have or need [Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md), [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md), [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint.md), or [Microsoft 365 E3](../../enterprise/microsoft-365-overview.md), this article is for you!

## Integrate Microsoft endpoint security with your RMM tools and PSA software

If you're a Microsoft Managed Service Provider (MSP), you can integrate Microsoft endpoint security with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and your professional service automation (PSA) software so that you can: 

- Get access to your customers' Microsoft 365 Defender portal to [address detected threats and incidents](mdb-respond-mitigate-threats.md).
- Get [email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md) about new alerts or vulnerabilities across your customers' tenants.
- Fetch and view [incidents and alerts](mdb-view-manage-incidents.md) with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Orchestrate [remediation actions](mdb-review-remediation-actions.md), such as approving actions following automated investigations, or taking manual response actions on a device.

Integration can be done by using the [Defender for Endpoint APIs](../defender-endpoint/management-apis.md). Use the following resources to learn more:

## Use Microsoft 365 Lighthouse to secure and manage your customers' devices and data

- Manage your customers' security settings and capabilities. 
- View and manage detected threats across your customers' tenants.
- Initiate antivirus scans on customers' devices to keep them up to date and protected.
