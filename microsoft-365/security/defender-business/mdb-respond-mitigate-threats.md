## View detected threats

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. Notice cards on the Home page. Cards tell you at a glance how many threats were detected, along with how many user accounts, endpoints (devices), and other assets were affected. The following image is an example of cards you might see:

3. Select a button or link on the card to view more information and take action. As an example, our **Devices at risk** card includes a **View details** button. Selecting that button takes us to the **Device inventory** page, as shown in the following image:

   The **Device inventory** page lists organization devices, along with their risk level and exposure level.

4. Select an item, such as a device. A flyout pane opens and displays more information about alerts and incidents generated for that item, as shown in the following image:  

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-business/mdb-deviceinventory-selecteddeviceflyout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the flyout pane for a selected device":::

5. On the flyout, view the information that is displayed. Select the ellipsis (...) to open a menu that lists available actions, as shown in the following image:

6. Select an available action. For example, you might choose **Run antivirus scan**, which will cause Microsoft Defender Antivirus to start a quick scan on the device. Or, you could select **Initiate Automated Investigation** to trigger an automated investigation on the device.
