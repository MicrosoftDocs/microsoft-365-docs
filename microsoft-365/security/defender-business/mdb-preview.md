Defender for Business is constantly being updated to include new feature enhancements and capabilities.

## What you need to know

- Are fully supported by Microsoft.
- Might only be available in selected geographic regions or cloud environments. For example, a preview feature might not exist in the government cloud.
- Individual features in preview might have more usage and support restrictions. If so, this information is typically noted in the feature documentation.
- The preview versions are provided with a standard support level, and can be used for production environments.
