# Get Microsoft Defender for Business

Defender for Business is a new endpoint security solution designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). This article describes how to get and provision Defender for Business.

If you don't already have Microsoft Defender for Business, you can choose from several options:

- [Try or buy the standalone version of Defender for Business](#try-or-buy-microsoft-defender-for-business).
- [Get Microsoft 365 Business Premium](#get-microsoft-365-business-premium), which now includes Defender for Business.
- [Work with a Microsoft partner](#work-with-a-microsoft-partner) who can help you get everything set up and configured.

## Try or buy Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person who signs your company up for Microsoft 365 is a global administrator. You should be a global administrator to complete the following task. [Learn more about admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

1. Go to the [Microsoft Defender for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-business) web page, and select an option to try or buy Defender for Business. Fill in the requested information.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're starting a trial, look for your acceptance email, which contains your promo code. And be sure to see the [Trial user guide for Defender for Business](trial-playbook-defender-business.md).

2. If you're adding Defender for Business to an existing Microsoft 365 subscription, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/)), and then sign in using your existing work or school account. Or, follow the prompts to create a new account, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/)), and then sign in using your new account. 

3. In the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/)), review your recommendations. Then take one of the following next steps, depending on your scenario:

   | Scenario | Next step |
   |:---|:---|
   | Defender for Business is your first Microsoft 365 subscription. | Proceed to step 4 to start provisioning Defender for Business. |
   | You're adding Defender for Business to an existing [Microsoft 365 for business subscription](../../admin/admin-overview/what-is-microsoft-365-for-business.md). | You've probably already [set up your Microsoft 365 subscription](../../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md), and now you only need to set up and configure Defender for Business. Proceed to step 4.  |
   | You have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but it's not set up yet. | Follow the guidance in [Microsoft 365 Business Premium â€“ productivity and cybersecurity for small business](../../business-premium/index.md). This guidance walks you through how to set up and configure your subscription, including your security capabilities. |

   > [!TIP]

4. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and in the navigation bar, go to **Assets** > **Devices**. This action initiates the provisioning of Defender for Business for your tenant. You'll know this process has started when you see a message like what's displayed in the following screenshot:

## Portals you'll use for setup and management

If your subscription also includes Microsoft Intune, you might use the Intune admin center as well. The following table summarizes these portals and how you'll use them.
