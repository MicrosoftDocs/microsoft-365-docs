To find a solution provider in your area, take the following steps:

1. Go to the **Microsoft Solution Providers** page ([https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers)).
 
2. In the search box, fill in your location and company size. 

3. In the **Search for products, services, skills, industries** box, put `Microsoft 365`, and then select **Go**.

4. Review the list of results. Select a provider to learn more about their expertise and the services they provide. Your provider can help you sign up for Defender for Business.

*Beginning March 1, 2022, Defender for Business is rolling out as part of Microsoft 365 Business Premium*.

## Sign up for the preview program

Participating in the preview program enables you to try out Defender for Business as a standalone subscription. The preview program is available to:

- Microsoft partners who provide IT services to small and medium-sized businesses
- Small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees) who do not already have Microsoft 365 Business Premium

2. Select **Customer** or **Microsoft Partner**.

3. Review and accept the terms of the Microsoft Defender for Business Preview Agreement, and then choose **Next**.

4. Fill out the form with your contact information. 

   - If you're a customer who is working with a Microsoft partner, in the **Other** box, fill in the company name of the partner. Then choose **Submit**.
   - If you're a Microsoft partner, make sure to indicate your partnership type and information about customers you're planning to work with.

5. When you have finished filling out the form, choose **Submit**.

## What to expect after applying

We'll review your application and make a determination. You'll then receive an email that either includes your promo code or that explains why we're not able to offer you the trial program at this time.

If you're accepted, your email will contain a license code that you'll use to activate your Defender for Business trial.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're a partner, after you have been accepted into the preview program, you must have each customer complete the process described in the section, [Sign up for the preview program](#sign-up-for-the-preview-program). Make sure the customer specifies your Microsoft partner name in the **Other** box.

## Two portals for setup

When you're ready to start your trial, you'll work with two main portals to get things set up. The following table summarizes the two main portals you'll use: <br/><br/>

|Portal  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| The Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/))      | Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to activate your trial and sign in for the first time.<br/><br/> You'll also use the Microsoft 365 admin center to: <br/>- Add or remove users<br/>- Assign user licenses<br/>- View your products and services<br/>- Complete setup tasks for your Microsoft 365 subscription <br/><br/> To learn more, see [Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview.md).      |
| The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com))     | Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to set up and configure Defender for Business. <br/><br/>You'll use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to: <br/>- View your devices and device protection policies<br/>- View detected threats and take action<br/>- View security recommendations and manage your security settings <br/><br/>To learn more, see [Get started using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdb-get-started.md).        |

If your company has Microsoft 365 Business Premium, then you have Microsoft Intune. You can use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com/](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/)) to manage devices and configure security settings. To learn more about Intune, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).

## Activate your trial

When you receive your acceptance email, here's how to activate your trial subscription: 

1. In your acceptance email, select the link that includes your promo code. 

2. If you already have a Microsoft 365 subscription, sign in using your account. If you don't already have a subscription, follow the prompts to create a new account. 

3. When you sign in for the first time, you'll go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/)). See [Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview.md).
