2. Turn on preview settings. 

   1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Endpoints** \> **Advanced features** \> **Preview features**. 
   2. Turn the setting to **On**, and then select **Save preferences**.

3. Turn on the enforcement scope for Windows Server. 

   1. Go to **Settings** \> **Endpoints** \> **Configuration management** \> **Enforcement scope**. 
   2. Select **Use MDE to enforce security configuration settings from MEM**, select  **Windows Server**, and then select **Save**.
