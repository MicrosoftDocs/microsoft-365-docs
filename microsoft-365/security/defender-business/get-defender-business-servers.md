# How to get Microsoft Defender for Business servers

Microsoft Defender for Business servers is an add-on to Defender for Business. This new offering enables you to secure your server operating systems with the same protection that you get for client devices in Defender for Business. This article describes how to get Microsoft Defender for Business servers and includes next steps and additional information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In order to add on Microsoft Defender for Business servers, you'll need at least one paid license for [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md) or [Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md) (standalone). 
> - You'll need one Microsoft Defender for Business servers license per server instance.
> - There's a limit of 60 Microsoft Defender for Business servers licenses per subscription to Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Defender for Business.
> - Alternately, you could use [Microsoft Defender for Servers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-introduction) to onboard your servers; however, your Defender for Business experience could change when you add an enterprise plan, such as Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2.
