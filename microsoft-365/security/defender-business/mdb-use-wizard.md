## Overview of the setup wizard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you begin, make sure that you have already added users to your Microsoft 365 subscription. To get help with this task, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../../admin/add-users/add-users.md).

The wizard is designed to help you set up and configure Defender for Business quickly and efficiently. The wizard walks you through the following steps:

1. **Assign user permissions**. In this step, you grant your security team access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). This portal is where you and your security team will manage your security capabilities, view alerts, and take any needed actions on detected threats. Portal access is granted through roles that imply certain permissions.

   In Defender for Business, members of your security team can be assigned one of three roles:<br/>
   
      - **Global Admin**: A global admin can view and edit all settings across your Microsoft 365 tenant. The global admin does the initial setup and configuration for your company's Microsoft 365 subscription. 
      - **Security Administrator**: A security administrator can view and edit security settings, and take action when threats are detected.
      - **Security Reader**: A security reader can view information in reports, but cannot change any security settings. 
      
      [Learn more about roles and permissions](mdb-roles-permissions.md). 

2. **Set up email notifications**. In this step, you can set up email notifications for your security team. Then, when an alert is generated or a new vulnerability is discovered, your security team will not about it even if they're away from their desk. 

   [Learn more about email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md). 

3. **Onboard and configure Windows devices**. In this step, you can onboard your company's Windows devices to Defender for Business quickly. Onboarding devices right away helps to protect those devices from day one. 

   - **If you're already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager** (which includes Microsoft Intune), and your company has devices enrolled in Endpoint Manager, you'll be asked whether you want to use [automatic onboarding](mdb-onboard-devices.md#automatic-onboarding-for-windows-devices-enrolled-in-microsoft-endpoint-manager) for some or all of your enrolled Windows devices. Automatic onboarding sets up a connection between Endpoint Manager and Defender for Business, and then onboards Windows devices to Defender for Business seamlessly. 
   - **If you're not already using Endpoint Manager**, you can [onboard devices to Defender for Business by using a local script](mdb-onboard-devices.md#local-script-in-defender-for-business). 
   
   See [Learn more about onboarding devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboard-devices.md).
   
4. **Configure your security policies**. Defender for Business includes default security policies for next-generation protection and firewall protection that can be applied to your company's devices. These default policies use recommended settings and are designed to provide strong protection for your devices. You can also create your own security policies. And, if you're already using Endpoint Manager, you can continue using that to manage your security policies.

   To learn more, see [View and edit your security policies and settings](mdb-configure-security-settings.md). |

## What happens if I don't use the wizard?

Using the setup wizard is optional. If you choose not to use the wizard, or if the wizard is closed before your setup process is complete, you can complete the setup and configuration process on your own. See [Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-setup-configuration.md) to walk through these steps:

1. **[Assign roles and permissions](mdb-roles-permissions.md)** so your security team can access and use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)).

2. **[Set up email notifications for your security team](mdb-email-notifications.md)** so they're in the loop about new alerts or vulnerabilities.

3. **[Onboard devices](mdb-onboard-devices.md)** so they're protected by Defender for Business.

4. **[Manage your security policies](mdb-configure-security-settings.md)**, which include next-generation protection, firewall protection, and web content filtering.
