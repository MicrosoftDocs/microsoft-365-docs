# Use the wizard to set up Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Defender for Business is now in preview, and will roll out gradually to customers and IT Partners who [sign-up here](https://aka.ms/mdb-preview) to request it. We will onboard an initial set of customers and partners in the coming weeks and will expand the preview leading up to general availability. Note that preview will launch with an [initial set of scenarios](mdb-tutorials.md#try-these-preview-scenarios), and we will be adding capabilities regularly.

Microsoft Defender for Business (preview) was designed to save small and medium-sized businesses time and effort with a wizard-like experience for initial setup and configuration. This article describes the steps of the wizard and your options for setting up and configuring Defender for Business manually.

## Overview of the wizard

The wizard is designed to help you set up and configure Defender for Business quickly and efficiently. The wizard walks you through the following steps:

1. **Assign user permissions**. In this step, you grant your security team access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). Portal access is granted through roles that imply certain permissions. [Learn more about roles and permissions](mdb-roles-permissions.md).

   - A Global Admin can view and edit all settings across your Microsoft 365 tenant. 
   - A Security Administrator can view and edit security settings. 
   - A Security Reader can only view information in reports. 

2. **Set up email notifications**. In this step, you determine who should receive email notifications in the event of a detected vulnerability or a new alert. Email notifications can help keep your security team informed, even if they're away from their desk. [Learn more about email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md). 

3. **Onboard and configure Windows devices**. In this step, you can onboard your organization's Windows devices to Defender for Business quickly. Onboarding devices right away helps to protect those devices from day one. [Learn more about device onboarding](mdb-onboard-devices.md).

   - If you're already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (which includes Microsoft Intune), you'll be asked if you want to use automatic onboarding, which sets up a connection between Endpoint Manager and Defender for Business, and then onboards all Windows devices that are enrolled in Endpoint Manager. 
   - If you're not already using Endpoint Manager, you can use gradual device onboarding and choose a set of devices to onboard to Defender for Business. 
   
4. **Configure your security policies**. Defender for Business includes default security policies that can be applied to your organization's devices. These default policies use recommended settings and are designed to provide strong protection for your devices. However, you can also create your own security policies if you wish. And, if you're already using Endpoint Manager, you can continue using that to manage your security policies.

   - [Choose where to manage security policies and devices](mdb-configure-security-settings.md#choose-where-to-manage-security-policies-and-devices).

## What happens if I don't use the wizard?

If you choose not to use the wizard, or if you exit the wizard before your setup process is complete, you can still complete your setup and configuration process on your own. See [Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-setup-configuration.md) to walk through the steps.
