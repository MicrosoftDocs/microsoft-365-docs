title: Microsoft Defender for Business troubleshooting
summary: |
  Use this article as a guide to resolve issues you might encounter in Defender for Business. 

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:

      - question: My setup and configuration process failed
        answer: |

          If you're using the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business and something went wrong, you can still configure your security settings and policies manually. See [Set up and configure Defender for Business](mdb-setup-configuration.md).

      - question: I'm seeing indications that some devices aren't protected even though they're onboarded to Defender for Business
        answer: |

          If devices are running a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware solution, real-time protection might be turned off when those devices are onboarded to Defender for Business. Real-time protection is turned on by default in Defender for Business, but a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware solution might affect your settings. When real-time protection is turned off, you'll see notifications in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) that some devices aren't protected. In these cases, make sure real-time protection is turned on.

          To confirm that real-time protection is turned on, you can view, and if necessary, edit your next-generation protection policies. See [View or edit your next-generation protection policies](/microsoft-365/security/defender-business/mdb-configure-security-settings?view=o365-worldwide#view-or-edit-your-next-generation-protection-policies).
          
          We recommend using Microsoft Defender Antivirus together with Defender for Business to get better protection that's coordinated across products and services. To learn more, see [Better together - Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/why-use-microsoft-defender-antivirus). 

      - question: I need to resolve a policy conflict
        answer: |

          Policy conflicts can arise when security policies are defined using multiple tools or methods. Here's an example:

          Suppose that Lee has been using Microsoft Intune to manage devices and security settings. Lee has recently started using Defender for Business. Lee has chosen to use the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business. Now, Lee sees policy conflicts in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center and in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. 

          Fortunately, policy conflicts can be resolved by taking one or more of the following actions:

          - Delete your existing policies in the Endpoint Manager admin center
          - See [Troubleshoot policies in Microsoft Intune](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-policies-in-microsoft-intune)

          See the following articles to learn more about your security policies in Defender for Business:

          - [Understand next-generation configuration settings in Defender for Business](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md)
          - [Firewall settings in Defender for Business](mdb-firewall.md)

      - question: There's an integration issue between Defender for Business and Microsoft Intune
        answer: |

          During your setup and configuration process, you might see an error message that says:

          *Something went wrong, and we couldn't complete your setup process. There's an integration issue between Defender for Business and Microsoft Endpoint Manager.*

          The error message means that a configuration channel must be established between Defender for Business and Microsoft Intune (managed in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center). If you see the error message, it means that something has gone wrong with integration. To resolve the issue, use the following three procedures:

          **Procedure 1: Turn on the Microsoft Intune connection in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal** 

          1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

          2. Choose **Settings** > **Endpoints**. Then, under **General**, select **Advanced features**.

          3. Scroll down to **Microsoft Intune connection**, and make sure it's turned on.

          **Procedure 2: Set the enforcement scope for Defender for Business**

          1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

          2. Choose **Settings** > **Endpoints**. Under **Configuration management**, select **Enforcement scope**.

          3. Under **OS platform**, turn on **Windows Client devices**.

          4. Select **Save**.

          **Procedure 3: Turn on Endpoint Security Profile settings in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**

          1. Go to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

          2. Select **Endpoint security**, and then, under **Setup**, select **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

          3. Under **Endpoint Security Profile Settings**, set **Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enforce Endpoint Security Configurations** to **On**.

      - question: Something went wrong with onboarding devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
        answer: |

          When you're onboarding devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), if something went wrong, an error message is displayed. This issue can occur if you're onboarding devices using a downloadable onboarding package for Microsoft Intune, Group Policy, System Center Configuration Manager, or Mobile Device Management capabilities with Defender for Business. 
          
          Defender for Business uses a capability called *Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint*. If onboarding in Defender for Business fails, the cause most likely has to do with Security Management for Defender for Endpoint. To resolve the issue, see the following articles:
          
          - [Troubleshoot onboarding issues related to Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-security-config-mgt)

          - [Run Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer on Windows](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-security-config-mgt#run-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-client-analyzer-on-windows)

          Alternately, you can try onboarding devices manually. See [Onboard devices](mdb-onboard-devices.md).
