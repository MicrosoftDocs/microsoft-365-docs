  Use this article as a guide to resolve issues you might encounter in Microsoft Defender for Business. 

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:

      - question: My setup and configuration process failed
        answer: |

          If you were using the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business and something went wrong, you can still configure your security settings and policies manually.

          See [Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-setup-configuration.md).

      - question: I need to resolve a policy conflict
        answer: |

          Policy conflicts can arise when security policies are defined using multiple tools or methods. Here's an example:

          Suppose that Lee has been using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage devices and security settings. Lee has recently started using Microsoft Defender for Business. Lee has chosen to use the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business. Now, Lee sees policy conflicts in Microsoft Endpoint Manager and in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. 

          Fortunately, policy conflicts can be resolved by taking one or more of the following actions:

          - Delete your existing policies in Microsoft Endpoint Manager
          - See [Troubleshoot policies in Microsoft Intune](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-policies-in-microsoft-intune)

          See the following articles to learn more about your security policies in Defender for Business:

          - [Understand next-generation configuration settings in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md)
          - [Firewall settings in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-firewall.md)

      - question: There's an integration issue between Defender for Business and Microsoft Endpoint Manager
        answer: |

          During your setup and configuration process, you might see an error message that says:

          *Something went wrong, and we couldn't complete your setup process. There's an integration issue between Defender for Business and Microsoft Endpoint Manager.*

          The error message means that a configuration channel must be established between Defender for Business and Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Something has gone wrong with integration. To resolve the issue, use the following three procedures:

          **Procedure 1: Turn on the Microsoft Intune connection in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal** 

          1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

          2. Choose **Settings** > **Endpoints**. Then, under **General**, select **Advanced features**.

          3. Scroll down to **Microsoft Intune connection**, and make sure it is turned on.

          **Procedure 2: Set the enforcement scope for Defender for Business**

          1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

          2. Choose **Settings** > **Endpoints**. Under **Configuration management**, select **Enforcement scope**.

          3. Under **OS platform**, turn on **Windows Client devices**.

          4. Select **Save**.

          **Procedure 3: Turn on Endpoint Security Profile settings in Microsoft Endpoint Manager**

          1. Go to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

          2. Select **Endpoint security**, and then, under **Setup**, select **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

          3. Under **Endpoint Security Profile Settings (Preview)**, set **Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enforce Endpoint Security Configurations (Preview)** to **On**.

      - question: Something went wrong with onboarding devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
        answer: |

          While onboarding devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), something might have gone wrong, and an error message is displayed. In particular, this issue can occur if you are onboarding devices using a downloadable onboarding package for Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Group Policy, System Center Configuration Manager, or Mobile Device Management in Defender for Business. 
          
          Microsoft Defender for Business uses a capability called *Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint*. If onboarding in Defender for Business fails, the cause most likely has to do with Security Management for Defender for Endpoint. To resolve the issue, see the following articles:
          
          - [Troubleshoot onboarding issues related to Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-security-config-mgt)

          - [Run Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer on Windows](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-security-config-mgt#run-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-client-analyzer-on-windows)

          Alternately, you can try onboarding devices manually. See [Onboard devices](mdb-onboard-devices.md).
