> 1. Microsoft Intune is not included in the standalone version of Defender for Business, but Intune can be added on. Intune is included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium.
> 
> 2. To onboard servers, we recommend using [Microsoft Defender for Business servers](get-defender-business.md#how-to-get-microsoft-defender-for-business-servers). Alternately, you could use [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers). To learn more, see [What happens if I have a mix of Microsoft endpoint security subscriptions?](mdb-faq.yml#what-happens-if-i-have-a-mix-of-microsoft-endpoint-security-subscriptions) and [Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboard-devices.md).

> 3. [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) is used to manage user permissions and device groups. Azure AD is included in your Defender for Business subscription. 
>    - If you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription before you start your trial, Azure AD will be provisioned for you during the activation process. 
>    - If you do have another Microsoft 365 subscription when you start your Defender for Business trial, you can use your existing Azure AD service. 
> 
> 4. Security defaults are included in Defender for Business. If you prefer to use Conditional Access policies instead, you'll need Azure AD Premium Plan 1 (included in [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md)). To learn more, see [Multi-factor authentication](../../business-premium/m365bp-turn-on-mfa.md).
