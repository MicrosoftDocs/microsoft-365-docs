# Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](microsoft-365-defender.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is now part of Microsoft Defender XDR. The Microsoft Defender portal allows security admins to perform their security tasks in one location. This simplifies workflows, and adds the functionality of the other Microsoft Defender XDR services. Microsoft Defender XDR will be the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure.

SOC analysts will be able to triage, investigate and hunt across all Microsoft Defender XDR workloads, including cloud apps.

Defender for Cloud Apps **alerts** will continue to appear in Microsoft Defender XDR's incidents queue and alerts queue, but now with relevant content inside the alert pages available in the Microsoft Defender portal, in a unified format with the proper adaptations to each alerts type. For more information, see [Investigate incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-incidents).

Take a look in Microsoft Defender XDR at <https://security.microsoft.com>.

## What's changed

Learn about the changes that have come with the integration of Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Defender XDR.

### Global search

Global search in Microsoft Defender XDR (using the search bar at the top of the page) now includes an additional searchable entity: it allows you to search for connected apps in Defender for Cloud Apps.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/global-search-apps.png" alt-text="Search for connected apps.":::

### Assets and identities

As part of the creation of a dedicated **Assets** section that spans the entire Microsoft Defender XDR experience, the **Users and Accounts** section of Defender for Cloud Apps is rebranded as the **Identities** section. No changes to functionality are expected.

### Preview features in Defender for Cloud Apps

Turn on the preview experience setting to be among the first to try upcoming features.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is now available in public preview.

1. Sign into Microsoft Defender XDR as a Global administrator, Security administrator, or Security Operator.

1. Select **Settings** > **Cloud apps** > **Preview features** > **Enable preview features**.

1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

You'll know you have preview features turned on when you see that the **Enable preview features** check box is selected. For example:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/preview-features.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable preview features.":::

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps preview features](/defender-cloud-apps/preview-features).

### Redirection from the classic Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal to Microsoft Defender XDR

Customers still using the classic Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal are all automatically redirected to Microsoft 365, and customers using preview features with the classic portal now have no option to switch back. If you're not using preview features, admins can still update the redirect setting as needed to continue using the classic Defender for Cloud Apps portal.

> [!NOTE]
> If something isn't working for you or if there's anything you're unable to complete through Microsoft Defender XDR, we want to hear about it. If you've encountered any issues with redirection, we encourage you to let us know by using the Give feedback submission form.
>

**To revert to the former Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal**:

1. Sign in to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft Defender XDR</a> as a Global administrator, Security administrator, or Cloud App Security administrator in Azure Active directory, or a local global admin in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

1. Make sure that you don't have Preview features turned on for your tenant. For more information, see [Preview features in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/preview-features).

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Cloud Apps** > **System** > **Redirection to Microsoft Defender XDR** or [go directly to the Redirection setting](https://security.microsoft.com/cloudapps/settings?tabid=autoRedirection).

1. Toggle the **Automatic redirection** setting to **Off**.

Once toggled off, accounts are no longer routed to *security.microsoft.com*. Active user sessions are not terminated, and the updates are applied only after the user ends their current session or opens a new tab.

The update might take effect almost immediately in some accounts, but may take longer to propagate to every account in your organization. This setting can be turned back on again at any time.
