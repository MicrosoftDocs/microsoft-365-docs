**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender



The `DeviceLogonEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about user logons and other authentication events on devices. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

>[!TIP]
> For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference available in the security center.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).

| Column name | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Timestamp` | datetime | Date and time when the event was recorded |
| `DeviceId` | string | Unique identifier for the machine in the service |
| `DeviceName` | string | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the machine |
| `ActionType` | string |Type of activity that triggered the event |
| `AccountDomain` | string | Domain of the account |
| `AccountName` | string | User name of the account |
| `AccountSid` | string | Security Identifier (SID) of the account |
| `Protocol` | string | Protocol used during the communication |
| `FailureReason` | string | Information explaining why the recorded action failed |
| `LogonType` | string | Type of logon session, specifically:<br><br> - **Interactive** - User physically interacts with the machine using the local keyboard and screen<br><br> - **Remote interactive (RDP) logons** - User interacts with the machine remotely using Remote Desktop, Terminal Services, Remote Assistance, or other RDP clients<br><br> - **Network** - Session initiated when the machine is accessed using PsExec or when shared resources on the machine, such as printers and shared folders, are accessed<br><br> - **Batch** - Session initiated by scheduled tasks<br><br> - **Service** - Session initiated by services as they start<br> |
| `LogonId` | string | Identifier for a logon session. This identifier is unique on the same machine only between restarts |
| `RemoteDeviceName` | string | Name of the machine that performed a remote operation on the affected machine. Depending on the event being reported, this name could be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), a NetBIOS name  or a host name without domain information |
| `RemoteIP` | string | IP address that was being connected to |
| `RemoteIPType` | string | Type of IP address, for example Public, Private, Reserved, Loopback, Teredo, FourToSixMapping, and Broadcast |
| `RemotePort` | int | TCP port on the remote device that was being connected to |
| `AdditionalFields` | string | Additional information about the event in JSON array format |
| `InitiatingProcessFileSize` | long | Size of the file that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountDomain` | string | Domain of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountName` | string | User name of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountSid` | string | Security Identifier (SID) of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |

Windows assigns integrity levels to processes based on certain characteristics, such as if they were launched from an internet download. These integrity levels influence permissions to resources |
| `InitiatingProcessTokenElevation` | string | Token type indicating the presence or absence of User Access Control (UAC) privilege elevation applied to the process that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessSHA1` | string | SHA-1 of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessSHA256` | string | SHA-256 of the process (image file) that initiated the event. This field is usually not populated—use the SHA1 column when available |
| `InitiatingProcessMD5` | string | MD5 hash of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessFileName` | string | Name of the process that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessId` | int | Process ID (PID) of the process that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessCommandLine` | string | Command line used to run the process that initiated the event |
