# Multi-tenant devices

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

## Tenant device list

The Tenants page in multi-tenant management lists each tenant you have access to. For each tenant, the page includes details such as the number of devices and device types, the number of high value and high exposure devices, and the number of devices available to onboard:

At the top of the page, you can view the number of tenants and the number of devices onboarded or discovered, across all tenants. You can also see the aggregate number of devices identified as:

- High risk
- High exposure
- Internet facing
- Can be onboarded
- Newly discovered
- High value

Select a tenant name to navigate to the device inventory for that tenant in [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/machines) portal where all data and inventory-related actions are available.

For more information, see [Device inventory](../defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview.md).
