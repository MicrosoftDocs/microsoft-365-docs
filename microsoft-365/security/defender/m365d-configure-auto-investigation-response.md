# Configure automated investigation and response capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

Microsoft 365 Defender includes powerful [automated investigation and response capabilities](m365d-autoir.md) that can save your security operations team much time and effort. With [self-healing](m365d-autoir.md#how-automated-investigation-and-self-healing-works), these capabilities mimic the steps a security analyst would take to investigate and respond to threats, only faster, and with more ability to scale.

This article describes how to configure automated investigation and response in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender</a> with these steps:

1. [Review the prerequisites](#prerequisites-for-automated-investigation-and-response-in-microsoft-365-defender).
2. [Review or change the automation level for device groups](#review-or-change-the-automation-level-for-device-groups).
3. [Review your security and alert policies in Office 365](#review-your-security-and-alert-policies-in-office-365).

Then, after you're all set up, you can [view and manage remediation actions in the Action center](m365d-autoir-actions.md). And, if necessary, you can [make changes to automated investigation settings](#need-to-make-changes-to-automated-investigation-settings).

## Review or change the automation level for device groups

Whether automated investigations run, and whether remediation actions are taken automatically or only upon approval for your devices depend on certain settings, such as your organization's device group policies. Review the configured automation level for your device group policies. You must be a global administrator or security administrator to perform the following procedure:

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. Go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device groups** under **Permissions**.

3. Review your device group policies. In particular, look at the **Automation level** column. We recommend using **Full - remediate threats automatically**.  You might need to create or edit your device groups to get the level of automation you want. To get help with this task, see the following articles:

   - [How threats are remediated](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/automated-investigations#how-threats-are-remediated)
   - [Create and manage device groups](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/machine-groups)

## Review your security and alert policies in Office 365

Microsoft provides built-in [alert policies](../../compliance/alert-policies.md) that help identify certain risks. These risks include Exchange admin permissions abuse, malware activity, potential external and internal threats, and data lifecycle management risks. Some alerts can trigger [automated investigation and response in Office 365](../office-365-security/air-about.md). Make sure your [Defender for Office 365](../office-365-security/defender-for-office-365.md) features are configured correctly.

Although certain alerts and security policies can trigger automated investigations, *no remediation actions are taken automatically for email and content*. Instead, all remediation actions for email and email content await approval by your security operations team in the [Action center](m365d-action-center.md).

Security settings in Office 365 help protect email and content. To view or change these settings, follow the guidance in [Protect against threats](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md).

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, go to **Policies & Rules** \> **Threat policies**.

2. Make sure all of the following policies are configured. To get help and recommendations, see [Protect against threats](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/protect-against-threats).

   - [Anti-malware](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#part-1---anti-malware-protection-in-eop)
   - [Anti-phishing](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#part-2---anti-phishing-protection-in-eop-and-defender-for-office-365)
   - [Anti-spam](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#part-3---anti-spam-protection-in-eop)
   - [Safe Attachments](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#safe-attachments-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)
   - [Safe Links](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#safe-links-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)

3. Make sure [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](../office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md) is turned on.

4. Make sure [Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in Exchange Online](../office-365-security/zero-hour-auto-purge.md) is in effect.

5. (This step is optional.) Review your [Office 365 alert policies](../../compliance/alert-policies.md) in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal ([https://compliance.microsoft.com/compliancepolicies](https://compliance.microsoft.com/compliancepolicies)). Several default alert policies are in the Threat management category. Some of these alerts can trigger automated investigation and response. To learn more, see [Default alert policies](../../compliance/alert-policies.md#default-alert-policies).

## Need to make changes to automated investigation settings?

You can choose from several options to change settings for your automated investigation and response capabilities. Some options are listed in the following table:

| To do this  | Follow these steps  |
|---------|---------|
| Specify automation levels for groups of devices     | <ol><li>Set up one or more device groups. See [Create and manage device groups](../defender-endpoint/machine-groups.md). </li><li>In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Permissions** > **Endpoints roles & groups** > **Device groups**.</li><li>Select a device group and review its **Automation level** setting. (We recommend using **Full - remediate threats automatically**). See [Automation levels in automated investigation and remediation capabilities](../defender-endpoint/automation-levels.md).</li><li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 as appropriate for all your device groups. </li></ol>     |
