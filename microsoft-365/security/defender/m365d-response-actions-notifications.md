# Get email notifications for response actions in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease](../includes/prerelease.md)]

You can set up Microsoft Defender XDR to notify you through email about manual or automated response actions.

[Manual response actions](respond-first-incident-remediate.md#manual-remediation) are actions that security teams can use to stop threats or aid in investigation of attacks. These actions vary depending on the Defender workload enabled in your environment.

[Automated response actions](respond-first-incident-remediate.md#automatic-remediation), on the other hand, are capabilities in Microsoft 35 Defender that scale investigation and resolution to threats automatically. Automated remediation capabilities consist of [automatic attack disruption](automatic-attack-disruption.md) and [automated investigation and response](m365d-autoir.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You need the **Manage security settings** permission to configure email notification settings. If you've chosen to use basic permissions management, users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator roles can configure email notifications. Likewise, if your organization is using [role-based access control (RBAC)](manage-rbac.md), you can only create, edit, delete, and receive notifications based on device groups that you are allowed to manage.

## Create a rule for email notifications

> [!NOTE]
> The response action email notification currently does not support custom detections containing response actions.

To create a rule for email notifications, perform the following steps:

1. In the navigation pane of Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Settings > Microsoft Defender XDR**.  Under **General**, select **Email notifications**. Go to the **Actions** tab.

2. Select **Add notification rule**. Add a rule name and description under Basics. Both Name and Description fields accept letters, numbers, and spaces only.

To be notified of response actions taken in all current and future device groups, selecting **All device** groups. To be notified of response actions taken in devices that belong to your selected device group, choose **Selected device groups**.

10. In the **Recipients** section, you can add one or more email addresses that will receive notifications. Separate multiple addresses by adding a comma at the end of each address. Select **Add** to add the recipients. You can see the recipients at the bottom of the pane after successfully adding addresses.
