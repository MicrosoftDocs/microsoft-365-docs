# Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]
**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Subscribers to Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) can now access threat intelligence from inside the Microsoft Defender portal.  

Microsoft Defender TI helps streamline security analyst triage, incident response, threat hunting, and vulnerability management workflows. Defender TI aggregates and enriches critical threat information in an easy-to-use interface.

This change introduces a new navigation menu within the Microsoft Defender portal named **Threat Intelligence**.

Under **Threat Intelligence** is the existing node for the **Threat Analytics** feature and two new additions:

- **Intel Profiles** - a new feature that introduces curated content organized by threat actors, their tools and known vulnerabilities
- **Intel Explorer** - the existing Defender TI content, search and investigation experience

The experience between the existing Defender TI standalone portal differs slightly from the version in Microsoft Defender XDR. Though most of the functionality is available, at this time, the Defender TI experience in Microsoft Defender XDR doesn't include the ability to apply custom tags or project capabilities.
