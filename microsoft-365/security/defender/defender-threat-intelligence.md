# Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence in Microsoft 365 Defender

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) is now available in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

This change introduces a new navigation menu within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal named **Threat Intelligence**.

Under **Threat Intelligence** is the existing node for the **Threat Analytics** feature and two new additions:

- **Intel Profiles** - a new feature that introduces curated content organized by threat actors, their tools and known vulnerabilities
- **Intel Explorer** - is the existing Defender TI content, search and investigation experience

The experience between the existing Defender TI standalone portal differs slightly from the version in Microsoft 365 Defender. Though most of the functionality is available, at this time, the Defender TI experience in Microsoft 365 Defender doesn't include the ability to apply custom tags or project capabilities.
