# Microsoft Defender for Identity in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](microsoft-365-defender.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/)

Microsoft Defender for Identity is now part of Microsoft 365 Defender, the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal allows security admins to perform their security tasks in one location, which simplifies workflows and integrating functionality from other Microsoft 365 Defender services.

Microsoft Defender for Identity contributes identity focused information into the incidents and alerts that Microsoft 365 Defender presents. This information is key to providing context and correlating alerts from the other products within Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Converged experiences in Microsoft 365 Defender

[Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com) combines security capabilities that protect, detect, investigate, and respond to email, collaboration, identity, and device threats, and now includes all functionality provided in the legacy, classic Defender for Identity portal.

While data placement might differ from the classic Defender for Identity portal, your data is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Defender pages so that you can view your data across all of your monitored entities.

The following sections describe enhanced Defender for Identity features found in Microsoft 365 Defender.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers using the classic Defender for Identity portal are now [automatically redirected to Microsoft 365 Defender](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender-blog/leveraging-the-convergence-of-microsoft-defender-for-identity-in/ba-p/3856321), with no option to revert back to the classic portal.


### Configuration and posture

|Area |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Global exclusions**     |   Global exclusions allow you to define certain entities, such as IP addresses, devices, or domains, to be excluded across all Defender for Identity detections. For example, if you only exclude a device, the exclusion applies only to detections that have a *device* identification as part of the detection. <br><br> For more information, see [Global excluded entities](/defender-for-identity/exclusions).  |
|**Manage action and directory service accounts**     |  You might want to respond to compromised users by disabling their accounts or resetting their password. When you take either of these actions, Microsoft 365 Defender is configured by default to use the *local system* account. Therefore, you'll only need to configure action and directory service account settings if you want to have more control, and define a different user account to perform user remediation actions.<br><br> For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity action accounts](/defender-for-identity/manage-action-accounts).      |
|**Custom permission roles**     |  Microsoft 365 Defender supports custom permission roles. <br><br>For more information, see  [Microsoft 365 Defender role-based access control (RBAC)](manage-rbac.md)      |
|**Microsoft Secure Score**     | Defender for Identity security posture assessments are available in [Microsoft Secure Score](https://security.microsoft.com/securescore). Each assessment is a downloadable report with instructions for use and tools to build an action plan for remediating or resolving the issue. Filter Microsoft Secure Score by **Identity** to view Defender for Identity assessments. <br><br> For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity's security posture assessments](/defender-for-identity/security-assessment).     |
|**API**     | Use any of the following Microsoft 365 Defender APIs with Defender for Identity: <br><br>- [Query activities via API](api-advanced-hunting.md) <br>- [Manage security alerts via API](api-incident.md) <br>- [Stream security alerts and activities to Microsoft Sentinel](streaming-api.md)<br><br>**Tip**: Microsoft 365 Defender only stores advanced hunting data for 30 days.  If you need longer retention periods, stream the activities to Microsoft Sentinel or another partner security information and event management (SIEM) system.         |
| **Onboarding** | Defender for Identity onboarding is now automatic for new customers, with no need to configure a workspace. <br><br>If you need to delete your instance, open a Microsoft support case. |

### Investigation 


|Area |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Identity page**     |  The Microsoft 365 Defender identity details page provides inclusive data about each identity, such as: <br><br>- Any associated alerts <br>- Active Directory account control<br>- Risky lateral movement paths<br>- A timeline of activities and alerts<br>- Details about observed locations, devices and groups. <br><br><!--The identity page contains more inclusive view from the different available products. <br>-->For more information, see [Investigate users in Microsoft 365 Defender](investigate-users.md). |
|**Device page**     | Microsoft 365 Defender alert evidence lists all devices and users connected to each suspicious activity.  Investigate further by selecting a specific device in an alert to access a device details page.  <br><br>For more information, see [Investigate devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Devices list](../defender-endpoint/investigate-machines.md). |
|**Advanced hunting**     |  Microsoft 365 Defender helps you proactively search for threats and malicious activity by using advanced hunting queries. These powerful queries can be used to locate and review threat indicators and entities for both known and potential threats. <br><br>Build custom detection rules from advanced hunting queries to help you proactively watch for events that might be indicative of breach activity and misconfigured devices. <br><br>For more information, see [Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender](advanced-hunting-overview.md).    |
|**Global search**     | Using the search bar at the top of the Microsoft 365 Defender page to search for any entity being monitored by Microsoft 365 Defender, including identities, endpoints, Office 365 data, and more. <br><br>Select results directly from the search drop-down, or select **All users** or **All devices** to see all entities associated with a given search term.  |
| **Lateral movement paths** | Microsoft 365 Defender provides lateral movement path data on the **Advanced hunting** page and the **Lateral movement paths** security assessment, in addition to the **Lateral movement paths** tab on the user details page. <br><br> For more information, see [Understand and investigate lateral movement paths (LMPs) with Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/understand-lateral-movement-paths). |

### Detection and response

|Area |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **Alert and incident correlation** |	Defender for Identity alerts are now included in Microsoft 365 Defender's alert queue, making them available to the automated incident correlation feature. <br><br>View all of your alerts in one place, and determine the scope of the breach even quicker than before. <br><br>For more information, see [Investigate Defender for Identity alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/manage-security-alerts). |
| **Alert exclusions** |	Microsoft 365 Defender's alert interface is more user friendly, and includes a search function and global exclusions, meaning you can exclude any entity from all alerts generated by Defender for Identity. <br><br>For more information, see [Configure Defender for Identity detection exclusions in Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/exclusions).|
| **Alert  tuning** |	Alert tuning, previously known as *alert suppression*, allows you to adjust and optimize your alerts. Alert tuning reduces false positives, allowing your SOC teams to focus on high-priority alerts, and improves threat detection coverage across your system.<br><br> In Microsoft 365 Defender, create rule conditions based on evidence types, and then apply your rule on any rule type that matches your conditions. For more information, see [Tune an alert](investigate-alerts.md#tune-an-alert).|
| **Remediation actions** |	Defender for Identity remediation actions, such as disabling accounts or requiring password resets, are available from the Microsoft 365 Defender user details page. <br><br>For more information, see [Remediation actions in Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/remediation-actions).
