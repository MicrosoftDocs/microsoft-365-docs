# DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Each row in the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` table contains an assessment event for a specific security configuration from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt). Use this reference to check the latest assessment results and determine whether devices are compliant.

You can join this table with the [DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsecureconfigurationassessmentkb-table.md) table using `ConfigurationId` so you can, for example, view the text description of the configuration from the `ConfigurationDescription` column of the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB` table, in the configuration assessment results.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).

| Column name | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `DeviceId` | `string` | Unique identifier for the device in the service |
| `DeviceName` | `string` | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the device |
| `OSPlatform` | `string` | Platform of the operating system running on the device. Indicates specific operating systems, including variations within the same family, such as Windows 11, Windows 10, and Windows 7.|
| `Timestamp` | `datetime` | Date and time when the record was generated |
| `ConfigurationId` | `string` | Unique identifier for a specific configuration |
| `ConfigurationCategory` | `string` | Category or grouping to which the configuration belongs: Application, OS, Network, Accounts, Security controls |
| `ConfigurationSubcategory` | `string` | Subcategory or subgrouping to which the configuration belongs. In many cases,  string describes specific capabilities or features. |
| `ConfigurationImpact` | `string` | Rated impact of the configuration to the overall configuration score (1-10) |
| `IsCompliant` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the configuration or policy is properly configured |
| `IsApplicable` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the configuration or policy applies to the device |
| `Context` | `string` | Additional contextual information about the configuration or policy |
| `IsExpectedUserImpact` | `boolean` | Indicates whether there will be user impact if the configuration or policy is applied |

You can try this example query to return information on devices with non-compliant antivirus configurations along with the relevant configuration metadata from the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB` table:

```kusto
// Get information on devices with antivirus configurations issues
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where ConfigurationSubcategory == 'Antivirus' and IsApplicable == 1 and IsCompliant == 0
| join kind=leftouter (
    DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB
    | project ConfigurationId, ConfigurationName, ConfigurationDescription, RiskDescription, Tags, ConfigurationImpact
) on ConfigurationId
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, ConfigurationId, ConfigurationName, ConfigurationCategory, ConfigurationSubcategory, ConfigurationDescription, RiskDescription, ConfigurationImpact, Tags
```
