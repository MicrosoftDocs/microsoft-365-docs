# Try Microsoft 365 Defender incident response capabilities in a pilot environment

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

This article is [Step 2 of 2](eval-defender-investigate-respond.md) in the process of performing an investigation and response of an incident in Microsoft 365 Defender using a pilot environment. For more information about this process, see the [overview](eval-defender-investigate-respond.md) article.

Once you have performed an [incident response for a simulated attack](eval-defender-investigate-respond-simulate-attack.md), here are some Microsoft 365 Defender capabilities to explore:

|Capability |Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| [Prioritizing incidents](#prioritize-incidents) | Use filtering and sorting of the incidents queue to determine which incidents to address next. |
| [Managing incidents](#manage-incidents) | Modify incident properties to ensure correct assignment, add tags and comments, and to resolve an incident. |
| [Automated investigation and response](#examine-automated-investigation-and-response-with-the-action-center) | Use automated investigation and response (AIR) capabilities to help your security operations team address threats more efficiently and effectively. The Action center is a "single pane of glass" experience for incident and alert tasks such as approving pending remediation actions. |
| [Advanced hunting](#use-advanced-hunting) | Use queries to proactively inspect events in your network and locate threat indicators and entities. You also use advanced hunting during the investigation and remediation of an incident. |


## Prioritize incidents

You get to the incident queue from **Incidents & alerts > Incidents** on the quick launch of the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents.png" alt-text="The Incidents & alerts section in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents.png":::


The **Most recent incidents and alerts** section shows a graph of the number of alerts received and incidents created in the last 24 hours.

To examine the list of incidents and prioritize their importance for assignment and investigation, you can: 

- Configure customizable columns (select **Choose columns**) to give you visibility into different characteristics of the incident or the impacted entities. This helps you make an informed decision regarding the prioritization of incidents for analysis.

- Use filtering to focus on a specific scenario or threat. Applying filters on the incident queue can help determine which incidents require immediate attention. 

From the default incident queue, select **Filters** to see a **Filters** pane, from which you can specify a specific set of incidents. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents-filters.png" alt-text="The Filters pane of the Incidents & alerts section in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents-filters.png":::

For more information, see [Prioritize incidents](incident-queue.md).

## Manage incidents

You can manage incidents from the **Manage incident** pane for an incident. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents-manage.png" alt-text="The Manage incident pane of the Incidents & alerts section in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents-manage.png":::

You can display this pane from the **Manage incident** link on the:

- Properties pane of an incident in the incident queue.
- **Summary** page of an incident.

Here are the ways you can manage your incidents:

- Edit the incident name

  Change the automatically assigned name based on your security team best practices.
  
- Add incident tags

  Add tags that your security team uses to classify incidents, which can be later filtered.
  
- Assign the incident

  Assign it to a user account name, which can be later filtered.
  
- Resolve an incident

  Close the incident after it has been remediated.
  
- Set its classification and determination

  Classify and select the threat type when you resolve an incident.
  
- Add comments

  Use comments for progress, notes, or other information based on your security team best practices. The full comment history is available from the **Comments and history** option in the details page of an incident.

For more information, see [Manage incidents](manage-incidents.md).

## Examine automated investigation and response with the Action center

Depending on how automated investigation and response capabilities are configured for your organization, remediation actions are taken automatically or only upon approval by your security operations team. All actions, whether pending or completed, are listed in the [Action center](m365d-action-center.md), which lists pending and completed remediation actions for your devices, email & collaboration content, and identities in one location.

Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/m3d-action-center-unified.png" alt-text="The Unified Action center in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/m3d-action-center-unified.png":::

From the Action center, you can select pending actions and then approve or reject them in the flyout pane. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/air-actioncenter-itemselected.png" alt-text="The pane displaying the options to approve or reject an action in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/air-actioncenter-itemselected.png":::


Approve (or reject) pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations can proceed and complete in a timely manner.

For more information, see [Automated investigation and response](m365d-autoir.md) and [Action center](m365d-action-center.md).

## Use advanced hunting

> [!NOTE]
> Before we walk you through the advanced hunting simulation, watch the following video to understand advanced hunting concepts, see where you can find it in the portal, and know how it can help you in your security operations.

If the [optional fileless PowerShell attack simulation](eval-defender-investigate-respond-simulate-attack.md#simulate-an-attack-with-an-isolated-domain-controller-and-client-device-optional) were a real attack that had already reached the credential access stage, you can use advanced hunting at any point in the investigation to proactively search through events and records in the network using what you already know from the generated alerts and affected entities. 

For instance, based on information in the [User and IP address reconnaissance (SMB)](eval-defender-investigate-respond-simulate-attack.md#alert-user-and-ip-address-reconnaissance-smb-source-microsoft-defender-for-identity) alert, you can use the `IdentityDirectoryEvents` table to find all the SMB session enumeration events, or find more discovery activities in various other protocols in Microsoft Defender for Identity data using the `IdentityQueryEvents` table.


### Hunting environment requirements

There's a single internal mailbox and device required for this simulation. You'll also need an external email account to send the test message.

1. Verify that your tenant has [enabled Microsoft 365 Defender](m365d-enable.md#confirm-that-the-service-is-on).
2. Identify a target mailbox to be used for receiving email.

   - This mailbox must be monitored by Microsoft Defender for Office 365

   - The device from requirement 3 needs to access this mailbox

3. Configure a test device:

    a. Make sure you are using Windows 10 version 1903 or later version.

    b. Join the test device to the test domain.

    c. [Turn on Windows Defender Antivirus](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-windows-defender-antivirus-features). If you are having trouble enabling Windows Defender Antivirus, see [this troubleshooting topic](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/troubleshoot-onboarding#ensure-that-microsoft-defender-antivirus-is-not-disabled-by-a-policy).

    d. [Onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-endpoints).

### Run the simulation

1. From an external email account, send an email to the mailbox identified in step 2 of the hunting environment requirements section. Include an attachment that will be allowed through any existing email filter policies. This file does not need to be malicious or an executable. Suggested file types are <i>.pdf</i>, <i>.exe</i> (if allowed), or an Office document type such as a Word file.

2. Open the sent email from the device configured as defined in step 3 of the hunting environment requirements section. Either open the attachment or save the file to the device.

#### Go hunting

1. Open the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>.

2. From the navigation pane, select **Hunting > Advanced hunting**.

3. Build a query that starts by gathering email events.

   1. Select **Query > New**.

   1. In the **Email** groups under **Advanced hunting**, double-click **EmailEvents**. You should see this in the query window.

      ```console
      EmailEvents
      ```

   1. Change the time frame of the query to the last 24 hours. Assuming the email you sent when you ran the simulation above was in the past 24 hours, otherwise change the time frame as needed.

   1. Select **Run query**. You may have differing results depending on your pilot environment.

      > [!NOTE]
      > See the next step for filtering options to limit data return.

      :::image type="content" source="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-1.png" alt-text="The Advanced Hunting page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-1.png":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Advanced hunting displays query results as tabular data. You can also opt to view the data in other format types such as charts.

   1. Look at the results and see if you can identify the email you opened. It may take up to two hours for the message to show up in advanced hunting. To narrow down the results, you can add the **where** condition to your query to only look for emails that have "yahoo.com" as their SenderMailFromDomain. Here's an example.

      ```console
      EmailEvents
      | where SenderMailFromDomain == "yahoo.com"
      ```

   1. Click the resulting rows from the query so you can inspect the record.

      :::image type="content" source="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-2.png" alt-text="The Inspect record section of the Advanced Hunting page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-2.png":::

4. Now that you have verified that you can see the email, add a filter for the attachments. Focus on all emails with attachments in the environment. For this simulation, focus on inbound emails, not those that are being sent out from your environment. Remove any filters you have added to locate your message and add "| where **AttachmentCount > 0** and **EmailDirection** == **"Inbound""**

   The following query will show you the result with a shorter list than your initial query for all email events:

   ```console
   EmailEvents
   | where AttachmentCount > 0 and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
   ```

5. Next, include the information about the attachment (such as: file name, hashes) to your result set. To do so, join the **EmailAttachmentInfo** table. The common fields to use for joining, in this case are **NetworkMessageId** and **RecipientObjectId**.

   The following query also includes an additional line "| **project-rename EmailTimestamp=Timestamp**" that'll help identify which timestamp was related to the email versus timestamps related to file actions that you'll add in the next step.

   ```console
   EmailEvents
   | where AttachmentCount > 0 and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
   | project-rename EmailTimestamp=Timestamp
   | join EmailAttachmentInfo on NetworkMessageId, RecipientObjectId
   ```

6. Next, use the **SHA256** value from the **EmailAttachmentInfo** table to find **DeviceFileEvents** (file actions that happened on the endpoint) for that hash. The common field here will be the SHA256 hash for the attachment.

   The resulting table now includes details from the endpoint (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) such as device name, what action was done (in this case, filtered to only include FileCreated events), and where the file was stored. The account name associated with the process will also be included.

   ```console
   EmailEvents
   | where AttachmentCount > 0 and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
   | project-rename EmailTimestamp=Timestamp
   | join EmailAttachmentInfo on NetworkMessageId, RecipientObjectId
   | join DeviceFileEvents on SHA256
   | where ActionType == "FileCreated"
   ```

   You've now created a query that'll identify all inbound emails where the user opened or saved the attachment. You can also refine this query to filter for specific sender domains, file sizes, file types, and so on.

7. Functions are a special kind of join, which let you pull more TI data about a file like its prevalence, signer and issuer info, etc. To get more details on the file, use the **FileProfile()** function enrichment:

    ```console
    EmailEvents
    | where AttachmentCount > 0 and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
    | project-rename EmailTimestamp=Timestamp
    | join EmailAttachmentInfo on NetworkMessageId, RecipientObjectId
    | join DeviceFileEvents on SHA256
    | where ActionType == "FileCreated"
    | distinct SHA1
    | invoke FileProfile()
    ```

#### Create a detection

Once you have created a query that identifies information that you'd like to **get alerted** about if they happen in the future, you can create a custom detection from the query.

Custom detections will run the query according to the frequency you set, and the results of the queries will create security alerts, based on the impacted assets you choose. Those alerts will be correlated to incidents and can be triaged as any other security alert generated by one of the products.

1. On the query page, remove lines 7 and 8 that were added in step 7 of the Go hunting instructions and click **Create detection rule**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-3.png" alt-text="The Query editing section of the Advanced Hunting page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/advanced-hunting-incident-response-try-3.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you click **Create detection rule** and you have syntax errors in your query, your detection rule won't be saved. Double-check your query to ensure there's no errors.

2. Fill in the required fields with the  information that will allow the security team to understand the alert, why it was generated, and what actions you expect them to take.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig23.png" alt-text="The Alert details page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig23.png":::

   Ensure that you fill out the fields with clarity to help give the next user an informed decision about this detection rule alert

3. Select what entities are impacted in this alert. In this case, select **Device** and **Mailbox**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig24.png" alt-text="The Impacted entities details page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig24.png":::

4. Determine what actions should take place if the alert is triggered. In this case, run an antivirus scan, though other actions could be taken.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig25.png" alt-text="The Actions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig25.png":::

5. Select the scope for the alert rule. Since this query involves devices, the device groups are relevant in this custom detection according to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint context. When creating a custom detection that does not include devices as impacted entities, scope does not apply.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig26.png" alt-text="The Scope page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig26.png":::


   For this pilot, you might want to limit this rule to a subset of testing devices in your production environment.

6. Select **Create**. Then, select **Custom detection rules** from the navigation panel.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig27a.png" alt-text="The Custom detection rules rules option in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig27a.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/mtp/fig27b.png" alt-text="The page displaying the detection rules and execution details in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/mtp/fig27b.png":::

   From this page, you can select the detection rule, which will open a details page.
