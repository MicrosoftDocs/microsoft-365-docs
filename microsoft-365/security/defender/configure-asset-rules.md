Maintaining an accurate inventory of devices in a constantly changing corporate environment is a critical task for security and IT teams. Failing to effectively manage device context, such as device value and tags, which many organizations use in their security workflows can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Devices may require updates, replacements, or reconfigurations due to changing business needs. This can create a significant challenge for security and IT teams who are responsible for the ongoing management of the device inventory, and ensuring devices are effectively tracked and managed over time.

Dynamic rules can help manage device context by assigning tags and device values automatically based on certain criteria. This will save time and ensure accuracy. For example, tagging devices with a specific OS version or assigning a value to devices with a particular naming convention. Dynamic rules also ensure devices remain relevant by removing tags or updating values when criteria are no longer met.

## Create a new dynamic rule

A rule can be based on device name, domain, OS platform, internet facing status, onboarding status and manual device tags. You can select or create a tag that will be applied based on the conditions you've set.

The following steps guide you on how to create a new dynamic rule in Microsoft Defender XDR:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) as a user who can view and perform actions on all devices.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Microsoft Defender XDR** \> **Asset Rule Management**.
3. Select **Create a new rule**.
4. Enter a **Rule name** and **Description***.
5. Select **Next** to choose the conditions you want to assign:

6. Select **Next** and choose the tag to apply to this rule.

7. Select **Next** to review and finish creating the rule and then select **Submit**.

>[!Note]
> It may take up to 1 hour for changes to be reflected in the portal.

### Dynamic tags in the Device Inventory

You can see the dynamic tags assigned in the Device Inventory view.

To see tags on individual devices:

1. Select **Devices** from the **Assets** navigation menu in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. In the **Device Inventory** page, select the device name that you want to view.
3. Select **Manage tags**.

### Updating rules

Dynamic tags and device values set by dynamic rules can't be manually updated. To edit, delete or turn off a rule, in the **Asset Rule Management** page select the rule and choose the action you wish to take:
