# Investigate alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Alerts are the basis of all incidents and indicate the occurrence of malicious or suspicious events in your environment. Alerts are typically part of a broader attack and provide clues about an incident.

In Microsoft 365 Defender, related alerts are aggregated together to form [incidents](incidents-overview.md). Incidents will always provide the broader context of an attack, however, analyzing alerts can be valuable when deeper analysis is required. 

The **Alerts queue** shows the current set of alerts. You get to the alerts queue from **Incidents & alerts > Alerts** on the quick launch of the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-queue.png" lightbox="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-queue.png" alt-text="Example of the alerts queue in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.":::

Alerts from different Microsoft security solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft 365 Defender appear here.

By default, the alerts queue in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal displays the new and in progress alerts from the last 30 days. The most recent alert is at the top of the list so you can see it first. 

From the default alerts queue, you can select **Filter** to see a **Filter** pane, from which you can specify a subset of the alerts. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-filter.png" lightbox="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-filter.png" alt-text="Example of the filters pane for the alerts queue in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.":::

You can filter alerts according to these criteria:

- Severity
- Status
- Service sources
- Entities (the impacted assets)
- Automated investigation state

## Required roles for Defender for Office 365 alerts

Youâ€™ll need to have any of the following roles to access Microsoft Defender for Office 365 alerts:

- For Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) global roles:

   - Global administrator

   - Security administrator

   - Security Operator

   - Global Reader

   - Security Reader

- Office 365 Security & Compliance Role Groups

   - Compliance Administrator

   - Organization Management 

- A [custom role](custom-roles.md)

## Analyze an alert

To see the main alert page, select the name of the alert. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-main.png" lightbox="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-main.png" alt-text="Example of the details page of an alert in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.":::

You can also select the **Open the main alert page** action from the **Manage alert** pane.

An alert page is composed of these sections: 

- Alert story, which is the chain of events and alerts related to this alert in chronological order
- Summary details

Throughout an alert page, you can select the ellipses (**...**) beside any entity to see available actions, such as opening the alert page or linking the alert to another incident.

### Alert sources

Microsoft 365 Defender alerts may come from solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and the app governance add-on for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. You may notice alerts with prepended characters in the alert. The following table provides guidance to help you understand the mapping of alert sources based on the prepended character on the alert.

> [!NOTE]
> - The prepended GUIDs are specific only to unified experiences such as unified alerts queue, unified alerts page, unified investigation, and unified incident.
> - The prepended character does not change the GUID of the alert. The only change to the GUID is the prepended component.

| Alert source | Prepended character |
| :---|:--- |
| Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | `fa{GUID}` <br> Example: `fa123a456b-c789-1d2e-12f1g33h445h6i` |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | `da` or `ed` for custom detection alerts <br> |
| Microsoft Defender for Identity | `aa{GUID}` <br> Example: `aa123a456b-c789-1d2e-12f1g33h445h6i` |
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps |`ca{GUID}` <br> Example: `ca123a456b-c789-1d2e-12f1g33h445h6i` |

### Analyze affected assets

The **Actions taken** section has a list of impacted assets, such as mailboxes, devices, and users affected by this alert. 

You can also select **View in action center** to view the **History** tab of the **Action center** in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. 

### Trace an alert's role in the alert story

The alert story displays all assets or entities related to the alert in a process tree view. The alert in the title is the one in focus when you first land on your selected alert's page. Assets in the alert story are expandable and clickable. They provide additional information and expedite your response by allowing you to take action right in the context of the alert page. 

> [!NOTE]
> The alert story section may contain more than one alert, with additional alerts related to the same execution tree appearing before or after the alert you've selected.

### View more alert information on the details page

The details page shows the details of the selected alert, with details and actions related to it. If you select any of the affected assets or entities in the alert story, the details page changes to provide contextual information and actions for the selected object.

Once you've selected an entity of interest, the details page changes to display information about the selected entity type, historic information when it's available, and options to take action on this entity directly from the alert page.

## Manage alerts

To manage an alert, select the alert in the alerts queue on its row to see a **Manage alert** pane. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-manage.png" lightbox="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-manage.png" alt-text="Example of the summary pane for an alert in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.":::

The **Manage alert** pane allows you to view or specify:

- The alert status (New, Resolved, In progress).
- The user account that has been assigned the alert.
- The alert's classification  (Not set, True alert, False Alert).
- For the classification as a true alert, the type of threat for the alert in **Determination** field.
- A comment on the alert.

> [!NOTE]
> One way of managing alerts it through the use of tags. The tagging capability for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is incrementally being rolled out and is currently in preview. <br>
> Currently, modified tag names are only applied to alerts created *after* the update. Alerts that were generated before the modification will not reflect the updated tag name. 

From this pane, you can also perform these additional actions: 

- Open the main alert page
- Consult a Microsoft threat expert
- View submission
- Link to another incident
- See the alert in a timeline
- Create a suppression rule

Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-actions.png" lightbox="../../media/investigate-alerts/alerts-ss-alerts-actions.png" alt-text="Example of the actions on an alert in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

The list of additional actions depends on the type of alert.

## Resolve an alert

Once you're done analyzing an alert and it can be resolved, go to the **Manage alert** pane for the alert and mark the status as **Resolved** and classify it as either a **False alert** or **True alert**. For true alerts, specify the alert's threat type in the **Determination** field.

Classifying alerts and specifying their determination helps tune Microsoft 365 Defender to provide more true alerts and less false alerts.

## Use Power Automate to triage alerts

Modern security operations (SecOps) teams need automation to work effectively. To focus on hunting and investigating real threats, SecOps teams use Power Automate to triage through the list of alerts and eliminate the ones that aren't threats.  

### Criteria for resolving alerts

- User has Out-of-office message turned on

- User isn't tagged as high risk

If both are true, SecOps marks the alert as legitimate travel and resolves it. A notification is posted in Microsoft Teams after the alert is resolved.

### Connect Power Automate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

To create the automation, you'll need an API token before you can connect Power Automate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

1. Click **Settings**, select **Security extensions**, and then click **Add token** in the **API tokens** tab.

2. Provide a name for your token, and then click **Generate**. Save the token as you'll need it later.

### Create an automated flow

For the detailed step-by-step process, see the video [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWFIRn).

This video also describes how to connect power automate to Defender for Cloud Apps.
