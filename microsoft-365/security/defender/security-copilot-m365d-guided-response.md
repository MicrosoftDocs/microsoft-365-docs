[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article only applies to the Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program, an invite-only paid preview program for commercial customers. Some information in this article relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

[Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender supports incident response teams in immediately resolving incidents with guided responses. Security Copilot and Microsoft 365 Defender use AI and machine learning capabilities to contextualize an incident and learn from previous investigations to generate appropriate response actions.

Responding to incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender often requires familiarity with the portal's available actions to stop attacks. In addition, new incident responders might have different ideas of where and how to start responding to incidents. The guided response capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender allows incident response teams at all levels to confidently and quickly apply response actions to resolve incidents with ease.

This guide outlines how to access the guided response capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender, including information on providing feedback about the responses.

## Technical requirements

[Learn about the requirements for Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements.md).

## Use guided responses to resolve incidents

Guided responses recommend actions in the following categories:

- Triage - includes a recommended action to classify incidents as informational, true positive, or false positive. It also includes a recommended action to set alert classification.
- Containment - includes recommended actions to contain an incident
- Investigation - includes recommended actions for further investigation
- Remediation - includes recommended response actions to apply to specific entities involved in an incident

Each card contains information about the recommended action, including the entity where the action will be applied and why the action is recommended.

To use guided responses, perform the following steps:

1. Open an incident page. Once the page loads, Security Copilot automatically generates guided responses.

2. Review the guided response cards generated by Security Copilot.

3. **Classify the incident** by selecting an option from the dropdown menu on the Triage card. You can classify the incident as true positive, informational, or false positive.
4. Review and apply each response generated by Security Copilot on the Containment, Investigation, and Remediation cards. You can provide feedback to each recommended action to continually enhance future responses.
5. Actions that are grayed out might mean they are unavailable to you due to insufficient permission. [Refer to the unified role-based access (RBAC) permissions](manage-rbac.md) page for more information.

Security Copilot and Microsoft 365 Defender make it easy for incident response teams to gain more context about actions with additional insights. For remediation responses, incident response teams can view additional information with options like **View similar incidents** or **View similar emails**.

The **View similar incidents** action becomes available when there are other incidents within the organization that are similar to the current incident. The Similar incidents tab lists similar incidents that you can review. Microsoft 365 Defender automatically identifies similar incidents within the organization through machine learning. Incident response teams can use the information from these similar incidents to classify incidents and further review the actions done in those similar incidents.

The **View similar emails** action, which is specific to phishing incidents, takes you to the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) page, where a  KQL query to list similar emails within the organization is automatically generated. This automatic query generation related to an incident helps incident response teams further investigate other emails that might be related to the incident. You can review the query and modify it as needed.

## Managing feedback

You can validate or report the responses provided by Security Copilot. Validating and reporting results improve Security Copilot's delivery of more accurate responses in the future.

Each response card has an option for providing feedback. [Follow these steps to provide your feedback about the results](security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender.md#providing-feedback).
