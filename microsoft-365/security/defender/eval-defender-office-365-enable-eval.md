This article is [Step 2 of 3](eval-defender-office-365-overview.md) in the process of setting up the evaluation environment for Microsoft Defender for Office 365. For more information about this process, see the [overview article](eval-defender-office-365-overview.md).

Use the following steps to enable the evaluation for Microsoft Defender for Office 365.


![Steps to enable Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in the Microsoft Defender evaluation environment](../../media/defender/m365-defender-office-eval-enable-steps.png)

- [Step 1: Activate trial licenses](#step-1-activate-trial-licenses)
- [Step 2: Audit and verify the public MX record](#step-2-audit-and-verify-the-public-mx-record)
- [Step 3: Audit accepted domains](#step-3-audit-accepted-domains)
- [Step 4: Audit inbound connectors](#step-4-audit-inbound-connectors)
- [Step 5: Activate the evaluation](#step-5-activate-the-evaluation)

## Step 1: Activate trial licenses

Log on to your existing Microsoft Defender for Office 365 environment or tenant administration portal.

1. Navigate to the administration portal.
2. Select Purchase Services from the quick launch.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/1_m365-purchase-services.png" alt-text="Click Purchase services on the navigation pane of Office 365.":::

3.	Scroll down to the Add-On section (or search for "Defender") to locate the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plans.
4.	Click Details next the plan you want to evaluate.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/2_mdo-eval-license-details.png" alt-text="Click the Details button, next.":::

5. Click the *Start free trial* link.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/3-m365-purchase-button.png" alt-text="Click the Start free trial *hyperlink* on this panel.":::

6. Confirm your request and click the *Try now* button.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/4_mdo-trial-order.png" alt-text="Now click the Try now *button*.":::

## Step 2: Audit and verify the public MX record

To effectively evaluate Microsoft Defender for Office 365, it's important that inbound external email be relayed through the Exchange Online Protection (EOP) instance associated with your tenant.

1. Log on to the M365 Admin Portal, expand Settings, and select Domains.
2. Select your verified email domain and click Manage DNS.
3. Make note of the MX record generated and assigned to your EOP tenant.
4. Access your external (public) DNS zone and check the primary MX record associated with your email domain.
    - *If your public MX record currently matches the assigned EOP address (e.g. tenant-com.mail.protection.outlook.com) then no further routing changes should be required*.
    - If your public MX record currently resolves to a third-party or on-premises SMTP gateway then additional routing configurations may be required.
    - If your public MX record currently resolves to on-premises Exchange then you may still be in a hybrid model where some recipient mailbox have not yet been migrated to EXO.

## Step 3: Audit accepted domains

1. Log on the Exchange Online Admin Portal, select Mail Flow, and then click Accepted Domains.
2. From the list of accepted domains that have been added and verified in your tenant, make note of the **domain type** for your primary email domain.
    - If the domain type is set to ***Authoritative*** then it is assumed all recipient mailboxes for your organization currently reside in Exchange Online.
    - If the domain type is set to ***Internal Relay*** then you may still be in a hybrid model where some recipient mailboxes still reside on-premises.

## Step 4: Audit inbound connectors

1. Log on the Exchange Online Admin Portal, select Mail Flow, and then click Connectors.
2. From the list of configured connectors, make note of any entries which are from **Partner Organization** and may correlate to a third-party SMTP gateway.
3. From the list of configured connectors, make note of any entries labeled **From your organization's email server** which may indicate that you are still in hybrid scenario.

## Step 5: Activate the evaluation

Use the instructions here to activate your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 evaluation from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

1. Log on to your tenant with an account that has access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
2. Choose whether you want to make the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal** your default interface for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 administration (recommended).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/1_mdo-eval-activate-eval.png" alt-text="Click the Turn on settings button to use the centralized and improved Microsoft 365 Defender portal for administration.":::

3. From the navigation menu, select **Policies & Rules** under *Email & Collaboration*.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/2_mdo-eval-activate-eval.png" alt-text="Here's an Email & Collaboration menu picture pointing at Policies & rules. Click that!":::

4. On the *Policy & Rules* dashboard, click **Threat Policies**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/3_mdo-eval-activate-eval.png" alt-text="Picture of the Policy & Rules dashboard and an arrow pointing at Threat policies. Click that next!":::

5. Scroll down to *Additional Policies* and select the **Evaluate Defender for Office 365** tile.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/4_mdo-eval-activate-eval.png" alt-text="The Eval Defender for Office 365 tile saying it's a 30 day trial across email & collaboration vectors. Click through.":::

6. Now choose whether external email routes to Exchange Online directly, or to a third-party gateway or service, and click Next.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/5_mdo-eval-activate-eval.png" alt-text="Defender for Office 365 will evaluate mail send to your Exchange Online mailboxes. Give the details of how your mail is routed now, including the name of the outbound connector that routs your mail. If you only use Exchange Online Protection (EOP) you won't have a connector. Choose one of I'm using a 3rd-party or on-premises provider, or I only use EOP.":::

7. If you use a third-party gateway, select the vendor name from the drop-down along with the inbound connector associated with that solution. When you've listed your answers, click Next.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/6-mdo-eval-activate-eval-settings.png" alt-text="In this dialog, you choose the 3rd-party vendor service your organization is using, or select *Other*. In the next dialog down, select the inbound connector. Then click Next.":::
