# Update incidents API

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> [!NOTE]
> **Try our new APIs using MS Graph security API**. Find out more at: [Use the Microsoft Graph security API - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn](/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview). For information about the new _update incident_ API using MS Graph security API, see [Update incident](/graph/api/security-incident-update).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## API description

Updates properties of existing incident. Updatable properties are: `status`, `determination`, `classification`, `assignedTo`, `tags`, and `comments`.

### Quotas, resource allocation, and other constraints

1. You can make up to 50 calls per minute or 1,500 calls per hour before you hit the throttling threshold.
2. You can set the `determination` property only if `classification` is set to TruePositive.

If your request is throttled, it returns a `429` response code. The response body indicates the time when you can begin making new calls.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Access the Microsoft Defender XDR APIs](api-access.md).

Permission type|Permission|Permission display name

Application|Incident.ReadWrite.All|Read and write all incidents
Delegated (work or school account)|Incident.ReadWrite|Read and write incidents

> [!NOTE]
> When obtaining a token using user credentials, the user needs to have permission to update the incident in the portal.

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for the fields that should be updated. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their values, unless they have to be recalculated due to changes to related values.
