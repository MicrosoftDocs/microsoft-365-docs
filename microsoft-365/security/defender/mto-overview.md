Managing multi-tenant environments can add an additional layer of complexity when it comes to keeping up with the ever-evolving security threats facing your enterprise. Navigating across multiple tenants can be time consuming and reduce the overall efficiency of security operation center (SOC) teams.

Multi-tenant management in Microsoft 365 Defender was designed to provide security operation teams with a single, unified view of all the tenants they manage. This view enables teams to quickly investigate incidents and perform advanced hunting across data from multiple tenants, improving their security operations.
