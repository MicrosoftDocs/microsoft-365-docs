# Investigate data loss prevention alerts with Microsoft Sentinel

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR
- Microsoft Sentinel

## Before you start

See, [Investigate data loss prevention alerts with Microsoft Defender XDR](dlp-investigate-alerts-defender.md) for more details.

## DLP investigation experience in Microsoft Sentinel

You can use the Microsoft Defender XDR connector in Microsoft Sentinel to import all DLP incidents into Sentinel to extend your correlation, detection, and investigation across other data sources and extend your automated orchestration flows using Sentinel's native SOAR capabilities.

1. Follow instructions on Connect data from Microsoft Defender XDR to Microsoft Sentinel to import all incidents including DLP incidents and alerts into Sentinel. Enable `CloudAppEvents` event connector to pull all Office 365 audit logs into Sentinel.

   You should be able to see your DLP incidents in Sentinel once the above connector is set up.

2. Select **Alerts** to view the alert page.

3. You can use **AlertType**, **startTime**, and **endTime** to query the **CloudAppEvents** table to get all the user activities that contributed to the alert. Use this query to identify the underlying activities:

```kusto
let Alert = SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where SystemAlertId == ""; // insert the systemAlertID here
CloudAppEvents
| extend correlationId1 = parse_json(tostring(RawEventData.Data)).cid
| extend correlationId = tostring(correlationId1)
| join kind=inner Alert on $left.correlationId == $right.AlertType
| where RawEventData.CreationTime > StartTime and RawEventData.CreationTime < EndTime
```
