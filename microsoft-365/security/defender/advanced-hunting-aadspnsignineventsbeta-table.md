# AADSpnSignInEventsBeta

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table is currently in beta and is being offered on a short-term basis to allow you to hunt through Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in events. Customers need to have an Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license to collect and view activities for this table. Microsoft will eventually move all sign-in schema information to the `IdentityLogonEvents` table.

The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table in the advanced hunting schema contains information about Azure Active Directory service principal and managed identity sign-ins. You can learn more about the different kinds of sign-ins in [Azure Active Directory sign-in activity reports - preview](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins).

Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, seeÂ [the advanced hunting reference](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-hunting-reference).
