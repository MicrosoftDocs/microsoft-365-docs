The `UrlClickEvents` table in the advanced hunting schema contains information about [Safe Links](../office-365-security/safe-links-about.md) clicks from email messages, Microsoft Teams, and Office 365 apps in supported desktop, mobile, and web apps.  UrlClickEvents is currently in public preview for Microsoft 365 Commercial customers and not available yet for GCC, GCC High, or DoD.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Timestamp` | `datetime` | The date and time when the user clicked on the link |
| `Url` | `string` | The full URL that was clicked on by the user |
| `ActionType` | `string` | Indicates whether the click was allowed or blocked by Safe Links or blocked due to a tenant policy, for instance, from Tenant Allow Block list|
| `AccountUpn` | `string` | User Principal Name of the account that clicked on the link|
| `Workload` | `string` | The application from which the user clicked on the link, with the values being Email, Office and Teams|
| `NetworkMessageId` | `string` | The unique identifier for the email that contains the clicked link, generated by Microsoft 365|
| `IPAddress` | `string` | Public IP address of the device from which the user clicked on the link|
| `ThreatTypes` | `string` | Verdict at the time of click, which tells whether the URL led to malware, phish or other threats|
| `DetectionMethods` | `string` | Detection technology that was used to identify the threat at the time of click|
| `IsClickedThrough` | `bool` | Indicates whether the user was able to click through to the original URL or wasn't allowed|
| `UrlChain` | `string` | For scenarios involving redirections, it includes URLs present in the redirection chain|
| `ReportId` | `string` | The unique identifier for a click event. For clickthrough scenarios, report ID would have same value, and therefore it should be used to correlate a click event.|


You can try this example query that uses the `UrlClickEvents` table to return a list of links where a user was allowed to proceed: 

```kusto
// Search for malicious links where user was allowed to proceed through
UrlClickEvents
| where ActionType == "ClickAllowed" or IsClickedThrough !="0"
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| summarize by ReportId, IsClickedThrough, AccountUpn, NetworkMessageId, ThreatTypes, Timestamp
```
