# Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR

The Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR Early Access Program is an invitation-only, paid preview. If your organization is interested in this program, work with your Microsoft account manager to learn more about nominations for a potential invite. To learn more about this program, see the [Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program FAQ](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot).

[Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) is a platform that brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help security teams respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Security Copilot is embedded in Microsoft Defender XDR for security teams to efficiently summarize incidents, analyze scripts and codes, use guided responses to resolve incidents, generate KQL queries, and create incident reports.

This article provides an overview for users of the Security Copilot embedded experience in Microsoft Defender XDR, including steps to access, key capabilities, and links that detail these capabilities.

## Access Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR

To ensure that you have access to Security Copilot, see the [Security Copilot purchase and licensing information](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot). Once you have access to Security Copilot, the key capabilities discussed below become accessible in the Microsoft Defender portal.

## Key features

Microsoft Defender XDR brings the capabilities of Security Copilot to the portal, enabling security teams to tackle attack investigations in a timely manner with ease and precision. Bringing AI to Microsoft Defender XDR allows teams to understand attacks immediately, promptly assess and apply appropriate mitigation to stop and contain attacks, quickly analyze complex files, and hunt for threats with ease.

### Summarize incidents quickly

Investigating incidents with multiple alerts can be a daunting task. To immediately understand an incident, you can tap Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR to [summarize an incident](security-copilot-m365d-incident-summary.md) for you. Security Copilot creates an overview of the attack containing essential information for you to understand what transpired in the attack, what assets are involved, and the timeline of the attack. Security Copilot automatically creates a summary when you navigate to an incident's page.

### Take action on incidents through guided responses

Approaching solutions and mitigation for any incident can oftentimes be complex for several reasons, including understanding where to begin, what solutions are appropriate, and following new investigation flows for security teams. Security Copilot minimizes these complications through [guided responses](security-copilot-m365d-guided-response.md). These responses are recommended actions specific to each incident.

### Get results fast when analyzing scripts and codes

Most attackers rely on sophisticated malware when launching attacks to avoid detection and analysis. These files are usually obfuscated and arrive as scripts, Powershell, batch, and bash. Security Copilot can quickly analyze these file types, reducing the time for [script or code analysis](security-copilot-m365d-script-analysis.md) and helping security teams decide on the next action steps using information from the analysis.

### Generate KQL queries from natural-language input

Security teams who use advanced hunting to proactively hunt for threats in their network can now use a query assistant that converts any natural-language question in the context of threat hunting, into a ready-to-run KQL query. The query assistant saves security teams time by generating a KQL query that can then be automatically run or further tweaked according to the analyst needs. Read more about the query assistant in [Security Copilot in advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-security-copilot.md).

### Write incident reports efficiently

Security operations teams usually write reports to record important information, including what response actions were taken and the corresponding results, the team members involved, and other information to aid future security decisions and learning. Oftentimes, documenting incidents can be time-consuming. For incident reports to be effective, it must contain an incident's summary along with the actions taken, including what actions were taken by whom and when. Security Copilot helps security teams consolidate these information pieces through the [create incident report](security-copilot-m365d-create-incident-report.md) feature.

## Providing feedback

Security Copilot and Microsoft Defender XDR uses AI and machine learning to process data and generate responses for each of the key features. However, AI might misinterpret some data, which sometimes cause a mismatch in responses. Providing your feedback about the generated responses enable both Security Copilot and Microsoft Defender XDR to continuously improve delivery of more accurate responses in the future.

All key features have an option for providing feedback. To provide feedback, perform the following steps:

1. Select the down arrow beside the face icon located at the bottom of any response card in the Security Copilot pane.
2. Select **Confirmed, it looks great** if the results are accurate based on your assessment. When results are confirmed, you can provide more information in the next dialog box.
3. Select **Off-target, inaccurate** if any detail is incorrect or incomplete based on your assessment. You can provide more information about your assessment in the next dialog box and submit this assessment to Microsoft.
4. You can also report the results if it contains questionable or ambiguous information by selecting **Potentially harmful, inappropriate**. Provide more information about the results in the next dialog box and select Submit.
