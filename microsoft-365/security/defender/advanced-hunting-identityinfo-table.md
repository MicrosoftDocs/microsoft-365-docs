# IdentityInfo

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**

The `IdentityInfo` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about user accounts obtained from various services, including Azure Active Directory. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

> This table was renamed from `AccountInfo`. During renames, all queries saved in the portal are automatically updated. Check queries you have saved elsewhere.
