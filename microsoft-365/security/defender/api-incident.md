# Microsoft 365 Defender incidents API and the incidents resource type

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

An [incident](incidents-overview.md) is a collection of related alerts that help describe an attack. Events from different entities in your organization are automatically aggregated by Microsoft 365 Defender. You can use the incidents API to programatically access your organization's incidents and related alerts.

## Quotas and resource allocation

You can request up to 50 calls per minute or 1500 calls per hour. Each method also has its own quotas. For more information on method-specific quotas, see the respective article for the method you want to use.

A `429` HTTP response code indicates that you've reached a quota, either by number of requests sent, or by allotted running time. The response body will include the time until the quota you reached will be reset.

## Permissions

The incidents API requires different kinds of permissions for each of its methods. For more information about required permissions, see the respective method's article.
