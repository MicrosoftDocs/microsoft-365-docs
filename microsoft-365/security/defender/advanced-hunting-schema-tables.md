# Understand the advanced hunting schema

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

The [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema is made up of multiple tables that provide either event information or information about devices, alerts, identities, and other entity types. To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to understand the tables and the columns in the advanced hunting schema.

## Get schema information

While constructing queries, use the built-in schema reference to quickly get the following information about each table in the schema:

- **Tables description**—type of data contained in the table and the source of that data.
- **Columns**—all the columns in the table.
- **Action types**—possible values in the `ActionType` column representing the event types supported by the table. This information is provided only for tables that contain event information.
- **Sample query**—example queries that feature how the table can be utilized.

### Access the schema reference
To quickly access the schema reference, select the **View reference** action next to the table name in the schema representation. You can also select **Schema reference** to search for a table.

## Learn the schema tables
The following reference lists all the tables in the schema. Each table name links to a page describing the column names for that table. Table and column names are also listed in the Defender for Cloud as part of the schema representation on the advanced hunting screen.
