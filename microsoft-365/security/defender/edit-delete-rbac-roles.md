In Microsoft 365 Defender role-based access control (RBAC), you can edit and delete custom roles or roles that were imported from Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, or Defender for Office 365.

## Edit roles

The following steps guide you on how to edit roles in Microsoft 365 Defender RBAC:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a Global Administrator or Security Administrator in Azure Active Directory, or have all the **Authorization** permissions assigned in Microsoft 365 Defender RBAC to perform this task. For more information on permissions, see [Permission pre-requisites](../defender/manage-rbac.md#permissions-pre-requisites).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) as global administrator or security administrator.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Permissions**.
3. Select **Roles** under Microsoft 365 Defender to get to the Permissions and roles page.
4. Select the role you want to edit. You can only edit one role at a time.
5. Select the **Edit** button or select **Edit** from the action menu next to the role name. This opens a flyout pane where you can edit the role:

## Delete Roles

To delete roles in Microsoft 365 Defender RBAC, select the role or roles you want to delete and select **Delete roles**.

If the workload is active, by removing the role all assigned user permission will be deleted.
