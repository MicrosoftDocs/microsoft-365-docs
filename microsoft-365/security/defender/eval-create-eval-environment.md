# Create the Microsoft 365 Defender Evaluation Environment

There are two common ways to do this next step in evaluation. This document assumes you already have a production M365 tenant, and will activate E5 trial licenses to evaluate M365 Defender in *the current environment*.

The second is to  [Set up your Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab environment](setup-m365deval.md) for the purpose of evaluation. It may not have many real signals from the business, so be aware of that caveat.

## To activate E5 trial licenses to evaluate Microsoft 365 Defender 
1. Log on to your existing M365 tenant administration portal.
