# Work with advanced hunting query results

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

While you can construct your [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) queries to return precise information, you can also work with the query results to gain further insight and investigate specific activities and indicators. You can take the following actions on your query results:

- View results as a table or chart
- Export tables and charts
- Drill down to detailed entity information
- Tweak your queries directly from the results

## View query results as a table or chart

By default, advanced hunting displays query results as tabular data. You can also display the same data as a chart. Advanced hunting supports the following views:

| View type | Description |
|--|--|
| **Table** | Displays the query results in tabular format |
| **Column chart** | Renders a series of unique items on the x-axis as vertical bars whose heights represent numeric values from another field |
| **Pie chart** | Renders sectional pies representing unique items. The size of each pie represents numeric values from another field. |
| **Line chart** | Plots numeric values for a series of unique items and connects the plotted values |
| **Scatter chart** | Plots numeric values for a series of unique items |
| **Area chart** | Plots numeric values for a series of unique items and fills the sections below the plotted values |
| **Stacked area chart** | Plots numeric values for a series of unique items and stacks the filled sections below the plotted values  |
| **Time chart** | Plots values by count on a linear time scale |

### Construct queries for effective charts

When rendering charts, advanced hunting automatically identifies columns of interest and the numeric values to aggregate. To get meaningful charts, construct your queries to return the specific values you want to see visualized. Here are some sample queries and the resulting charts.

#### Alerts by severity

Use the `summarize` operator to obtain a numeric count of the values you want to chart. The query below uses the `summarize` operator to get the number of alerts by severity.

```kusto
AlertInfo
| summarize Total = count() by Severity
```

When rendering the results, a column chart displays each severity value as a separate column:

*Query results for alerts by severity displayed as a column chart*

#### Phishing emails across top ten sender domains

If you're dealing with a list of values that isn't finite, you can use the `Top` operator to chart only the values with the most instances. For example, to get the top 10 sender domains with the most phishing emails, use the query below:

```kusto
EmailEvents
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| summarize Count = count() by SenderFromDomain
| top 10 by Count
```

Use the pie chart view to effectively show distribution across the top domains:

*Pie chart that shows distribution of phishing emails across top sender domains*

#### File activities over time
Using the `summarize` operator with the `bin()` function, you can check for events involving a particular indicator over time. The query below counts events involving the file `invoice.doc` at 30-minute intervals to show spikes in activity related to that file:

```kusto
CloudAppEvents
| union DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName == "invoice.doc"
| summarize FileCount = count() by bin(Timestamp, 30m)
```

The line chart below clearly highlights time periods with more activity involving `invoice.doc`:

## Export tables and charts

After running a query, select **Export** to save the results to local file. Your chosen view determines how the results are exported:

- **Table view**—The query results are exported in tabular form as a Microsoft Excel workbook
- **Any chart**—The query results are exported as a JPEG image of the rendered chart

## Drill down from query results

To quickly inspect a record in your query results, select the corresponding row to open the **Inspect record** panel. The panel provides the following information based on the selected record:

- **Assets**—Summarized view of the main assets (mailboxes, devices, and users) found in the record, enriched with available information, such as risk and exposure levels
- **All details**—All the values from the columns in the record

:::image type="content" source="../../media/results-inspect-record.png" alt-text="The selected record with panel for inspecting the record in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/results-inspect-record.png":::

To view more information about a specific entity in your query results, such as a machine, file, user, IP address, or URL, select the entity identifier to open a detailed profile page for that entity.

## Tweak your queries from the results

Select the three dots to the right of any column in the **Inspect record** panel. You can use the options to:

- Explicitly look for the selected value (`==`)
- Exclude the selected value from the query (`!=`)
- Get more advanced operators for adding the value to your query, such as `contains`, `starts with`, and `ends with`

> Some tables in this article might not be available at Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. [Turn on Microsoft 365 Defender](m365d-enable.md) to hunt for threats using more data sources. You can move your advanced hunting workflows from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to Microsoft 365 Defender by following the steps in [Migrate advanced hunting queries from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](advanced-hunting-migrate-from-mde.md).
