# Create the Microsoft 365 Defender Evaluation Environment

- [**Return to the Overview** 'Evaluate and pilot Microsoft 365 Defender' | Microsoft Docs](../office-365-security/defender/eval-overview.md) 
- [Establishing the Evaluation Environment](#establishing-the-evaluation-environment)

There are two common ways to do this. This document assumes you already have a production M365 tenant, and will activate E5 trial licenses to evaluate M365 Defender in *the current environment* in order to ultimately retain these features with the purchase of licenses after the evaluation period.

The second is to [build an environment from scratch](m365d-evaluation.md) for the purpose of evaluation. It may not have many real signals from the business, so be aware of that caveat.

1. Logon to your existing M365 tenant administration portal.
2. Select "Purchase Services" from the navigation menu.

3. Scroll down to the "Office 365" section and click "Details" button under Office 365 E5 license.

4. Click "Start free trial" link.

5. Confirm your request and click "Try now" button.
