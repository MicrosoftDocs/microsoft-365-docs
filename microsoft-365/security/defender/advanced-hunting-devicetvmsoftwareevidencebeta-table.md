# DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` table is currently in beta. Once it leaves beta, the final table name will change and column names may also change. The modifications will then likely break queries that are still using previous names. Users are advised to review and adjust their queries when this table is finalized. 

The `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` table in the advanced hunting schema contains data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) related to the [software evidence section](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-software-inventory#software-evidence). This table allows you to view evidence of where a specific software was detected on a device. You can use this table, for example, to identify the file paths of specific software. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
