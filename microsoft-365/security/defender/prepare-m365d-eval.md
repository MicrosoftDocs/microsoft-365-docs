# Prepare your Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab or pilot environment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Creating a Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab or pilot environment and deploying it is a three-phase process:

|--|--|--|--|
|*You are here!* | || |

You're currently in the preparation phase.


Preparation is key to any successful deployment. This section will guide you through what you need to consider as you prepare to create a trial lab or pilot environment for your Microsoft 365 Defender deployment.

## Prerequisites
Learn about the licensing, hardware and software requirements, and other configuration settings to provision and use Microsoft 365 Defender. See the minimum requirements for [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/prerequisites), [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/minimum-requirements), [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description), [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-prerequisites), [Microsoft Cloud App Security](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-prerequisites).

## Stakeholders and sign-off
Identify all the stakeholders that are involved in the project and who may need to sign-off, review, or stay informed, whether for evaluation or running a pilot project.

>[!NOTE]
>Not all organizations might have the security organization maturity to have such roles. In such case, consult with your leadership team on review and approval accountabilities.

Add stakeholders
to the table below as appropriate for your organization.

-   SO = Sign-off on this project

-   R = Review this project and provide input

-   I = Informed of this project

## Prepare your Azure Active Directory
Skip this step if you have already enabled synchronization between Active Directory and Azure Active Directory on premises. Review existing best practices documentation from Azure Active Directory. The following steps are optimized to evaluate or run a pilot Microsoft 365 Defender project.

1. Go to the [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade) portal > **Azure AD Connect**.

2. Click **Download** from **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** and transfer it to your Domain Controller.
![Image of Azure Active Directoru Connect download page](../../media/mtp-eval-2.png) <br>

3. On the domain controller, follow the Azure Active Directory Connect wizard. Read the license terms and privacy notice and select the checkbox if you agree. Click **Continue**.

4. Navigate to **Express Settings**.

5. Enter your global administrator credentials. Click **Next**.

6. Enter your Active Directory Domain Services enterprise administrator credentials. Click **Next**.

You can now [add users and groups to Active Directory](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-playbook-setup-lab#bkmk_hydrate) and [configure a SAM-R policy](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/atp-playbook-setup-lab#configure-sam-r-capabilities-from-contosodc).  


## Configuration order
The following table indicates the order Microsoft recommends for configuring the Microsoft 365 Defender components for your trial lab or pilot environment deployment.

| Component                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Configuration order rank |
