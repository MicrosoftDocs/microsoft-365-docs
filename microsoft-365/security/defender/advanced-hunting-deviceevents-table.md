# DeviceEvents

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The miscellaneous device events or `DeviceEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about various event types, including events triggered by security controls, such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus and exploit protection. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

> [!TIP]
> For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference available in Microsoft Defender XDR.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
