# Microsoft Defender portal

The Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com> combines protection, detection, investigation, and response to email, collaboration, identity, device, and cloud app threats, in a central place. The Defender portal emphasizes quick access to information, simpler layouts, and bringing related information together for easier use. It includes:

- **[Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365)** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps organizations secure their enterprise with a set of prevention, detection, investigation and hunting features to protect email, and Office 365 resources.
- **[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection)** delivers preventative protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response for devices in your organization.
- **[Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/what-is)** is a cloud-based security solution that uses your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
- **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/)** is a comprehensive cross-SaaS and PaaS solution bringing deep visibility, strong data controls, and enhanced threat protection to your cloud apps.

## What to expect

The Defender portal helps security teams investigate and respond to attacks by bringing in signals from different workloads into a set of unified experiences for:

- Incidents & alerts
- Hunting
- Actions & submissions
- Threat analytics
- Secure score
- Learning hub
- Trials
- Partner catalog

Microsoft Defender XDR emphasizes *unity, clarity, and common goals*.

> [!NOTE]
> The Defender portal is accessible without any need for customers to take migration steps or purchase a new license. For example, this new portal is accessible to administrators with an E3 subscription, just as it is to those with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2; however, Exchange Online Protection, or Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 customers see only the security features their subscription license supports. The goal of the portal is to centralize security.

## Incident and alert investigations

Centralizing security information creates a single place for investigating security incidents across Microsoft 365. A primary example is **Incidents** under **Incidents & alerts**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents.png" alt-text="The Incidents page in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/incidents-queue/incidents-ss-incidents.png":::

Selecting an incident name displays a page that demonstrates the value of centralizing security information as you get better insights into the full extend of a threat, from email, to identity, to endpoints.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-ss-incident-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the attack story page for an incident in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-ss-incident-summary.png":::

Take the time to review the incidents in your environment, drill down into each alert, and practice building an understanding of how to access the information and determine next steps in your analysis.

For more information, see [incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR](incidents-overview.md).

## Hunting
You can build custom detection rules and hunt for specific threats in your environment. **Hunting** uses a query-based threat hunting tool that lets you proactively inspect events in your organization to locate threat indicators and entities. These rules run automatically to check for, and then respond to, suspected breach activity, misconfigured machines, and other findings.

For more information, see [Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR](advanced-hunting-overview.md).

## Improved processes

Common controls and content either appear in the same place, or are condensed into one feed of data making it easier to find. For example, unified settings.

### Unified settings

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converged-add-role-9.png" alt-text="The Settings page in the Microsoft Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/converged-add-role-9.png":::

### Permissions

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converged-roles-5.png" alt-text="The Endpoints roles & groups displayed on the Permissions & roles page" lightbox="../../media/converged-roles-5.png":::

Access to Microsoft Defender XDR is configured with Microsoft Entra global roles or by using custom roles.

- Learn more about how to [manage access to Microsoft Defender XDR](m365d-permissions.md)
- Learn more about how to [create custom roles](custom-roles.md) in Microsoft Defender XDR

### Integrated reports

Reports are also unified in Microsoft Defender XDR. Admins can start with a general security report, and branch into specific reports about endpoints, email & collaboration. The links here are dynamically generated based upon workload configuration.

### Quickly view your Microsoft 365 environment

The **Home** page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user role. Because the Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles see cards that are more meaningful to their day to day jobs.

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. Microsoft Defender XDR brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

You can add and remove different cards depending on your needs.

### Search across entities (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.
The search bar is located at the top of the page. As you type, suggestions are provided so that it's easier to find entities. The enhanced search results page centralizes the results from all entities.

You can search across the following entities in Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Identity:

- **Devices** - supported for both Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Identity. Supports use of search operators.
- **Users** - supported for Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, and Defender for Cloud Apps.
- **Files, IPs, and URLs** - same capabilities as in Defender for Endpoint.

  > [!NOTE]
  > IP and URL searches are exact match and don't appear in the search results page â€“ they lead directly to the entity page.

- **MDVM** - same capabilities as in Defender for Endpoint (vulnerabilities, software, and recommendations).

## Threat analytics

Track and respond to emerging threats with the following Microsoft Defender XDR threat analytics:
