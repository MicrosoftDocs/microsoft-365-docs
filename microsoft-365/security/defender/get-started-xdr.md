## Grant permissions to our experts

By default, Defender Experts for XDR requires **Service provider access** that lets our experts sign into your tenant and deliver services based on assigned security roles. [Learn more about cross-tenant access](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview)

You also need to grant our experts temporary, scoped access only as needed, depending on the type of work you'd like them to handle on your behalf:

- **Investigate incidents and guide my responses** (default) – This option lets our experts proactively monitor and investigate incidents and guide you through any necessary response actions. (Access level: Security Reader)
- **Respond directly to active threats** (recommended) – This option lets our experts contain and remediate active threats immediately while investigating, thus reducing the threat's impact, and improving your overall response efficiency. (Access level: Security Operator)

## Tell us who to contact for important matters

Defender Experts for XDR lets you determine the individuals or groups within your organization that need to be notified if there are critical incidents, service updates, occasional queries, and other recommendations. Once identified, the individuals will receive an email notifying them that they have been chosen as a contact for incident notification or service review purposes.

## Run initial Defender Experts readiness checks

Apart from onboarding service delivery, our expertise on the Microsoft 365 Defender product suite enables Defender Experts for XDR to run an initial readiness assessment to help you get the most out of your Microsoft security products.

The initial readiness engagement is based on your [Microsoft Secure Score](../defender/microsoft-secure-score.md) and Defender Experts' policy recommendations. Our experts collaborate with you to prioritize and tailor recommendations that align with your environment. They seek your immediate involvement to implement these configurations and comprehend the necessary actions for initiating operations.

Once the readiness checks are completed, our experts will start monitoring your environment closely to identify latent threats, sources of risk, and normal activity. As we get better understanding of your critical assets, we can streamline the service and fine-tune our responses.
