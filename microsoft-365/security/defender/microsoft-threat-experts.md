## Receive targeted attack notification

The Microsoft Threat Experts – Targeted Attack Notification capability provides proactive hunting for the most important threats to your network. Our threat experts hunt for human adversary intrusions, hands-on-keyboard attacks, and advanced attacks, such as cyberespionage. These notifications will show up as a new alert. The managed hunting service includes:

- Threat monitoring and analysis, reducing dwell time and the risk to your business
- Hunter-trained artificial intelligence to discover and target both known attacks and emerging threats
- Identification of the most pertinent risks, helping SOCs maximize their effectiveness
- Help scoping compromises and providing as much context as can be quickly delivered to enable a swift SOC response.

## Collaborate with experts on demand

You can also contact Microsoft threat experts from directly inside the Microsoft 365 security portal, for a swift and accurate threat response.  Experts can provide insight to better understand the complex threats your organization may face.  Consult an expert to:

- Gather additional information on alerts and incidents, including root causes and scope
- Gain clarity into suspicious devices, alerts, or incidents and get next steps if faced with an advanced attacker
- Determine risks and available protections related to threat actors, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques
