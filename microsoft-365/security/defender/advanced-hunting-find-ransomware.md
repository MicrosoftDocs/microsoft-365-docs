# Hunt for ransomware

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Ransomware has rapidly evolved from being simple commodity malware affecting individual computer users to an enterprise threat that is severely impacting industries and government institutions. While [Microsoft 365 Defender](microsoft-365-defender.md) provides many capabilities that detect and block ransomware and associated intrusion activities, performing proactive checks for signs of compromise can help keep your network protected.

> [Read about human-operated ransomware](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)

With [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender, you can create queries that locate individual artifacts associated with ransomware activity. You can also run more sophisticated queries that can look for signs of activity and weigh those signs to find devices that require immediate attention.

## Signs of ransomware activity
Microsoft security researchers have observed various common yet subtle artifacts in many ransomware campaigns launched by sophisticated intruders. These signs mostly involve use of system tools to prepare for encryption, prevent detection, and clear forensic evidence.

| Ransomware activity | Common tools | Intent |
|--|--|--|
| Stop processes | _taskkill.exe_, _net stop_ | Ensure files targeted for encryption are not locked by various applications. |
| Turn off services | _sc.exe_ | - Ensure files targeted for encryption are not locked by various applications.<br>- Prevent security software from disrupting encryption and other ransomware activity.<br>- Stop backup software from creating recoverable copies.  |
| Delete logs and files | _cipher.exe_, _wevtutil_, _fsutil.exe_ | Remove forensic evidence. |
| Delete shadow copies  | _vsadmin.exe_, _wmic.exe_ | Remove drive shadow copies that can be used to recover encrypted files. |
| Delete and stop backups | _wbadmin.exe_ | Delete existing backups and stop scheduled backup tasks, preventing recovery after encryption. |
| Modify boot settings | _bcdedit.exe_ | Turn off warnings and automatic repairs after boot failures that can be caused by the encryption process. |
| Turn off recovery tools | _schtasks.exe_, _regedit.exe_, | Turn off System Restore and other system recovery options. |

## Check for individual signs of ransomware activity
Many activities that constitute ransomware behavior, including the activities described in the preceding section, can be benign. When using the following queries to locate ransomware, run more than one query to check whether the same devices are exhibiting various signs of possible ransomware activity.

### Stopping multiple processes using _taskkill.exe_

```

### Turning off System Restore
This query identifies attempts to stop System Restore and prevent the system from creating restore points, which can be used to recover data encrypted by ransomware. [Run query](https://security.microsoft.com/hunting?query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAK2S3UrDQBCFz7XgO6y9id4o6HWvrIVCkaJPENOYFNumZGO1ID673w4xJA1isbJMZnZ-zpzM7EiptlooQc9UqjDLc-7wp1qrwj7Via44MzK35FTotTI5PXMr0aVe8cy15NzoGo-zqg_0m3KQSsRpQtbC6uMGpdt3jHeJfU_GymqG-uQb9XpcEn1HIuvmGpZT0Aq99Dim4G3ousNO8K04sSE6EEN22kL6jvzO-LaDNW2QzqxLmGBsPo9vUMt_oA8Na3DQv3vwcmPiifpmds48jkhut8T2FLikxm_T4bI_m_6uQt-wrXO28lPPSBcdziOqPFlP9RYy47tDKtuZM07hVtSvaJ_HYRPL63-NyMgtmtWv5684jy2WDx2O0ZEM562ZBLQvURxur6gDAAA&runQuery=true&timeRangeId=week)

| where ProcessCommandLine has "shadowcopy" and ProcessCommandLine has "delete"
| project DeviceId, Timestamp, InitiatingProcessFileName, FileName,
ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

## Check for multiple signs of ransomware activity
Instead of running several queries separately, you can also use a comprehensive query that checks for multiple signs of ransomware activity to identify affected devices. The following consolidated  query:
- Looks for both relatively concrete and subtle signs of ransomware activity
- Weighs the presence of these signs
- Identifies devices with a higher chance of being targets of ransomware 

When run, this consolidated query returns a list of devices that have exhibited multiple signs of attack. The count of each type of ransomware activity is also shown. To run this consolidated query, copy it directly to the [advanced hunting query editor](https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting). 

```kusto

```
### Understand and tweak the query results
The consolidated query returns the following results:

- **DeviceId**—identifies the affected device 
- **TimeStamp**—first time any sign of ransomware activity was observed on the device
- **Specific signs of activity**—the count for each sign shown in multiple columns, such as _BcdEdit_ or _FsUtil_
- **TotalEvidenceCount**—number of observed signs
- **UniqueEvidenceCount**—number of types of observed signs

:::image type="content" source="../../media/advanced-hunting-ransomware-query.png" alt-text="An example of a consolidated query for a ransomware activity in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

*Query results showing affected devices and counts of various signs of ransomware activity*

By default, the query result lists only devices that have more than two types of ransomware activity. To see all devices with any sign of ransomware activity, modify the following `where` operator and set the number to zero (0). To see fewer devices, set a higher number. 

```kusto
| where UniqueEvidenceCount > 2
```
