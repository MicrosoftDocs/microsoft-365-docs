# Set the time zone for Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR



Microsoft Defender XDR can display date and time information using either your local time zone or UTC. The selected time zone will apply to all date and time information shown in the following features in the Microsoft Defender portal:
- Incidents
- Automated investigation and remediation, including the action center
- Advanced hunting results
- Identity timeline

To set the time zone for these features, go to **Settings** > **Security center** > **Time zone**

> [!NOTE]
> The custom time range filter in advanced hunting remains in UTC regardless of the time zone setting.
