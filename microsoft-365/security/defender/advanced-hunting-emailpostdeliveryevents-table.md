# EmailPostDeliveryEvents

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

The `EmailPostDeliveryEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about post-delivery actions taken on email messages processed by Microsoft 365. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

>[!TIP]
> For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference available in the security center.

To get more information about individual email messages, you can also use the [`EmailEvents`](advanced-hunting-emailevents-table.md), [`EmailAttachmentInfo`](advanced-hunting-emailattachmentinfo-table.md), and the [`EmailUrlInfo`](advanced-hunting-emailurlinfo-table.md) tables. For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
