**Applies to:**

The `EmailPostDeliveryEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about post-delivery actions taken on email messages processed by Microsoft 365. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

To get more information about individual email messages, you can also use the [`EmailEvents`](advanced-hunting-emailevents-table.md), [`EmailAttachmentInfo`](advanced-hunting-emailattachmentinfo-table.md), and the [`EmailUrlInfo`](advanced-hunting-emailurlinfo-table.md) tables. For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
