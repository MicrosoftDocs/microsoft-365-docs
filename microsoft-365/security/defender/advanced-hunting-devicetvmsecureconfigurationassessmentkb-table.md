# DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB` table in the advanced hunting schema contains information about the various secure configurations checked by [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt). It also includes risk information, related industry benchmarks, and applicable MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics.

This table doesn't return events or records. We recommend joining this table to the [DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsecureconfigurationassessment-table.md) table using `ConfigurationId` to view text information about the security configurations in the returned assessments.

For example, when you query the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` table you might want to view the `ConfigurationDescription` for the security configurations that come up in the assessment results. You can see this information by joining this table to `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` using `ConfigurationId` and project `ConfigurationDescription`.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).

| Column name | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `ConfigurationId` | `string` | Unique identifier for a specific configuration |
| `ConfigurationImpact` | `real` | Rated impact of the configuration to the overall configuration score (1-10) |
| `ConfigurationName` | `string` | Display name of the configuration |
| `ConfigurationDescription` | `string` | Description of the configuration |
| `RiskDescription` | `string` | Description of the associated risk |
| `ConfigurationCategory` | `string` | Category or grouping to which the configuration belongs: Application, OS, Network, Accounts, Security controls|
| `ConfigurationSubcategory` | `string` |Subcategory or subgrouping to which the configuration belongs. In many cases, this describes specific capabilities or features. |
| `ConfigurationBenchmarks` | `dynamic` | List of industry benchmarks recommending the same or similar configuration |
| `Tags` | `dynamic` | Labels representing various attributes used to identify or categorize a security configuration |
| `RemediationOptions` | `string` | Recommended actions to reduce or address any associated risks |

You can try this example query to return relevant configuration metadata along with information on devices with non-compliant antivirus configurations from the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` table:

```kusto
// Get information on devices with antivirus configurations issues
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where ConfigurationSubcategory == 'Antivirus' and IsApplicable == 1 and IsCompliant == 0
| join kind=leftouter (
    DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB
    | project ConfigurationId, ConfigurationName, ConfigurationDescription, RiskDescription, Tags, ConfigurationImpact
) on ConfigurationId
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, ConfigurationId, ConfigurationName, ConfigurationCategory, ConfigurationSubcategory, ConfigurationDescription, RiskDescription, ConfigurationImpact, Tags
```
