# Configure Microsoft 365 Defender to stream Advanced Hunting events to your Storage account

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

> [!NOTE]
> **Try our new APIs using MS Graph security API**. Find out more at: [Use the Microsoft Graph security API - Microsoft Graph beta | Microsoft Learn](/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview).

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

## Before you begin

1. Create a [Storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) in your tenant.

2. Log in to your [Azure tenant](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), go to **Subscriptions > Your subscription > Resource Providers > Register to Microsoft.Insights**.

### Add contributor permissions

Once the Storage account is created you will need to:

1. Define the user who will be logging into Microsoft 365 Defender as Contributor.

    Go to **Storage Account > Access control (IAM) > Add** and verify under **Role assignments**.

## Enable raw data streaming

1. Log in to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender</a> as a ***Global Administrator*** or ***Security Administrator***.

2. Go to **Settings** \> **Microsoft 365 Defender** \> **Streaming API**. To go directly to the **Streaming API** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/settings/mtp_settings/raw_data_export>.

3. Click **Add**.

4. In the **Add new Streaming API settings** flyout that appears, configure the following settings:
   1. **Name**: Choose a name for your new settings.
   2. Select **Forward events to Azure Storage**.
4. To display the Azure Resource Manager resource ID for a storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

   1. Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
   2. On the **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, select the **JSON View** link.
   3. The resource ID for the storage account is displayed at the top of the page, copy the text under **Storage Account Resource ID**.

   4. Back on the **Add new Streaming API settings** flyout, choose the **Event types** that you want to stream.

   When you're finished, click **Submit**.

## The schema of the events in the Storage account

- A blob container will be created for each event type:

  :::image type="content" source="../defender-endpoint/images/storage-account-event-schema.png" alt-text="Example of a blob container" lightbox="../defender-endpoint/images/storage-account-event-schema.png":::

- The schema of each row in a blob is the following JSON:

  ```JSON
  {
          "time": "<The time Microsoft 365 Defender received the event>"
          "tenantId": "<Your tenant ID>"
          "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
          "properties": { <Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
  }
  ```

- Each blob contains multiple rows.

- Each row contains the event name, the time Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you will only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "properties".

- For more information about the schema of Microsoft 365 Defender events, see [Advanced Hunting overview](../defender/advanced-hunting-overview.md).

## Data types mapping

In order to get the data types for our events properties do the following:

1. Log in to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender</a> and go to **Hunting** \> **Advanced hunting**. To go directly to the **Advanced hunting** page, use <security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting>.

2. On the **Query** tab, run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event:

   ```text
   {EventType}
   | getschema
   | project ColumnName, ColumnType
   ```

- Here is an example for Device Info event:

## Monitoring created resources

You can monitor the resources created by the streaming API using **Azure Monitor**. 
For more information, see [Monitor destinations - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Docs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal#monitor-destinations).
