# Configure Microsoft 365 Defender to stream Advanced Hunting events to your Storage account

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

## Before you begin

1. Create a [Storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) in your tenant.

2. Log in to your [Azure tenant](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), go to **Subscriptions > Your subscription > Resource Providers > Register to Microsoft.Insights**.

## Enable raw data streaming

1. Log in to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>) as a ***Global Administrator*** or ***Security Administrator***.

2. Go to **Settings** \> **Microsoft 365 Defender** \> **Streaming API**. To go directly to the **Streaming API** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/settings/mtp_settings/raw_data_export>.

3. Click **Add**.

4. In the **Add new Streaming API settings** flyout that appears, configure the following settings:
   1. **Name**: Choose a name for your new settings.
   2. Select **Forward events to Azure Storage**.
   3. In the **Storage Account Resource ID** box that appears, type your **Storage Account Resource ID**. To get your **Storage Account Resource ID**, open the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>, click **Storage accounts** \> go to the properties tab \> copy the text under **Storage Account Resource ID**.

   4. Back on the **Add new Streaming API settings** flyout, choose the **Event types** that you want to stream.

   When you're finished, click **Submit**.

## The schema of the events in the Storage account

- A blob container will be created for each event type:

- The schema of each row in a blob is the following JSON:

  ```JSON
  {
          "time": "<The time Microsoft 365 Defender received the event>"
          "tenantId": "<Your tenant ID>"
          "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
          "properties": { <Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
  }
  ```

- Each blob contains multiple rows.

- Each row contains the event name, the time Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you will only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "properties".

- For more information about the schema of Microsoft 365 Defender events, see [Advanced Hunting overview](../defender/advanced-hunting-overview.md).

## Data types mapping

In order to get the data types for our events properties do the following:

1. Log in to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>) and go to **Hunting** \> **Advanced hunting**. To go directly to the **Advanced hunting** page, use <security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting>.

2. On the **Query** tab, run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event:

   ```text
   {EventType}
   | getschema
   | project ColumnName, ColumnType
   ```

- Here is an example for Device Info event:
