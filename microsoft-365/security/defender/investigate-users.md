# Investigate users in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

Part of your incident investigation can include user accounts. Start with the **Users** tab for an incident from **Incidents & alerts** \> ***incident*** \> **Users**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-incidents/incident-users.png" alt-text="Example of a Users page for an incident.":::

To get a quick summary of a user account for the incident, select the check mark next to the user account name. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-users/incidents-ss-user-pane.png" alt-text="Example of the user account summary pane for an incident in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

> [!NOTE]
> The User page shows Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization as well as groups, helping you understand the groups and permissions associated with a user.

In this fly-out page, you can review user threat information, including any current incidents, active alerts, and risk level as well as user exposure, accounts, devices, and more.

In addition, you can take action directly in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to address a compromised user, confirming the user is compromised or requiring them to sign in again.

From here, you can select **Go to user page** to see the details of a user account. Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-users/incidents-ss-user-details.png" alt-text="Example of the user account page for an incident in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

You can also see this page by selecting the name of the user account from the list on the **Users** page.

You can see group membership for the user, by selecting the number under **Groups**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-users/user-group-membership.png" alt-text="Example of the group membership for a user in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

By selecting the icon under **Manager**, you can see where the user is in the organization tree.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal user page combines information from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Cloud App Security (depending on what licenses you have).

This page shows information specific to the security risk of a user account. This includes a score that helps assess risk and recent events and alerts that contributed to the overall risk of the user.

From this page, you can do these additional actions:

- Mark the user account as compromised
- Require the user to sign in again
- Suspend the user account
- See the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account settings
- View the files owned by the user account
- View files shared with this user.

Here's an example.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-users/incidents-ss-user-details-actions.png" alt-text="Example of the actions on a user account for an incident in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::

<!--
You can access this page from multiple areas in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. You can access this page from a specific incident in the **Users** tab. Some alerts might include users as a specific affected asset. You can also search for users.  

Learn more about how to investigate users and potential risk [in this Cloud App Security tutorial](/cloud-app-security/tutorial-ueba#:~:text=To%20identify%20who%20your%20riskiest,user%20page%20to%20investigate%20them).

-->

## View lateral movement paths

By selecting the **Lateral movement paths** tab, you can view a fully dynamic and clickable map that provides you with a visual representation of the lateral movement paths to and from this user that can be used to infiltrate your network.

The map provides you with a list of how many hops between computers or users an attacker would have to and from this user to compromise a sensitive account, and if the user has a sensitive account, you can see how many resources and accounts are directly connected.

If a potential lateral movement path wasn't detected for the entity during the past two days, the graph doesn't display. Select a different date using View a different date to view previous lateral movement paths graphs discovered for this entity. The lateral movement path report is always available to provide you with information about the potential lateral movement paths discovered, and can be customized by time.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/investigate-users/lateral-movement-path.png" alt-text="Example of the lateral movement path for a user in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal":::
