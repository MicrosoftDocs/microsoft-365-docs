# IdentityLogonEvents

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

The `IdentityLogonEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about authentication activities made through your on-premises Active Directory captured by Microsoft Defender for Identity and authentication activities related to Microsoft online services captured by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

> [!TIP]
> For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference available in Microsoft 365 Defender.

> [!NOTE]
> This table covers Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) logon activities tracked by Defender for Cloud Apps, specifically interactive sign-ins and authentication activities using ActiveSync and other legacy protocols. Non-interactive logons that are not available in this table can be viewed in the Azure AD audit log.
