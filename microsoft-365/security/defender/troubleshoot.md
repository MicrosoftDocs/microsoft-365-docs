# Troubleshoot Microsoft Defender XDR service issues

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR

This section addresses issues that might arise as you use the Microsoft Defender XDR service.

<a name='i-dont-see-microsoft-365-defender-content'></a>

## I don't see Microsoft Defender XDR content

If you don't see capabilities on the navigation pane such as the Incidents, Action center, or Hunting in your portal, you need to verify that your tenant has the appropriate licenses.

For more information, see [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

## Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts are not showing up in the Microsoft Defender XDR incidents

If you have Microsoft Defender for Identity deployed in your environment but you're not seeing Defender for Identity alerts as part of Microsoft Defender XDR incidents, you need to ensure that the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Defender for Identity integration is enabled.

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity integration](/cloud-app-security/mdi-integration).

## Where is the settings page for turning on the service?

To turn on Microsoft Defender XDR, access **Settings** from the navigation pane in the Microsoft Defender portal. This navigation item is visible only if you have the [prerequisite permissions and licenses](m365d-enable.md#check-license-eligibility-and-required-permissions).

## How do I create an exception for my file/URL?

A false positive is a file or URL that is detected as malicious but isn't a threat. You can create indicators and define exclusions to unblock and allow certain files/URLs. See [Address false positives/negatives in Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-false-positives-negatives).
