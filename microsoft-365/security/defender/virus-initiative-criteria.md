# Microsoft Virus Initiative

The Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) helps organizations improve the security solutions our customers rely on to keep them safe. We provide tools, resources, and knowledge to support better-together experiences with great performance, reliability, and compatibility.

5.	Your organization must sign a program license agreement.
