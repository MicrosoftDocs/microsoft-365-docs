# Run script and code analysis with Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article only applies to the Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program, an invite-only paid preview program for commercial customers. Some information in this article relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Through AI-powered investigation capabilities from [Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) embedded in Microsoft Defender XDR, security teams can speed up their analysis of malicious or suspicious scripts and codes within PowerShell, batch, and bash.

Most complex and sophisticated attacks like [ransomware](/security/ransomware) evade detection through numerous ways, including the use of scripts and PowerShell. Moreover, these scripts are often obfuscated, which adds to the complexity of detection and analysis. Security operations teams need to quickly analyze scripts and codes to understand capabilities and apply appropriate mitigation, immediately stopping attacks from progressing further within a network.

> [!NOTE]
> Script analysis functions are continuously in development. Analysis of scripts in languages other than PowerShell, batch, and bash are being evaluated.

The script analysis capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR provides security teams added capacity to inspect scripts and codes without using external tools. This capability also reduces complexity of analysis, minimizing challenges and allowing security teams to quickly assess and identify a script as malicious or benign.

This guide describes what the script analysis capability is and how it works, including how you can provide feedback on the results generated.

> [!NOTE]
> The script analysis capability is also available in the Security Copilot standalone experience through the Microsoft Defender XDR plugin. Know more about [preinstalled plugins in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/manage-plugins#preinstalled-plugins).

## Technical requirements

[Learn how you can get started with Security Copilot](/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot).

## Analyze a script or code

You can access the script analysis capability in the alert timeline within an incident and in the [device timeline](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-timeline-event-flag).

To begin analysis, perform the following steps:

1. Open an incident page. In the attack story tab, select an alert on the left pane to open the alert timeline. Select an event within the timeline and select **Analyze** to start the script analysis.

Alternately, you can select an event to inspect in the device timeline view. In the process tree shown on the file details pane, select **Analyze**.

2. Security Copilot analyzes the script and displays the results in the script analysis card. In the script analysis card, select **Show code** to expand and see specific lines in the code related to the analysis. Select **Hide code** to close.

3. Select the three dots on the upper right of the script analysis card to copy or regenerate the results, or view the results in the Security Copilot standalone experience. Selecting **Open in Security Copilot** opens a new tab to the Security Copilot standalone portal where you can input prompts and access other plugins.
