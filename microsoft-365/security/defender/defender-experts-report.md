## Know and understand the prevalent threats in your environment

Threat categories help identify and organize security threats into classes to assess and evaluate their impact and develop strategies to prevent or mitigate these threats to your environment. The **Threat categories observed** section of the report shows a bar chart with significant risks and threats detected in your environment, helping you understand the breadth and scope of your exposure.

Among the various threat categories available, the following categories are carefully chosen because they aren't covered under the purview of MITRE ATT&CK framework:

- Delivery

You can prioritize remediation based on the most impacted category, as depicted in the bar chart.
