# Before you begin

**Applies to:**

This document outlines the key prerequisites you must meet and essential information you must know before purchasing the Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR service.

## Eligibility and licensing

Defender Experts for XDR is a separate service from your existing Defender products. To enable us to get started with this managed service, we require the following licensing prerequisites:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 must be licensed and enabled on eligible devices
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus must be licensed and enabled in active mode on devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint (required for endpoint detection and response capabilities)
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium P1 must be licensed for all users and enabled (required for enabling secure service provider access)

Aside from the requirements stated previously, to get Defender Experts for XDR coverage for the following eligible products, you must have their appropriate product licenses:
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P2
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

Defender Experts for XDR is a managed extended detection and response (XDR) service. To get native XDR coverage, we recommend deploying the full Microsoft 365 Defender suite.

As part of the service's built-in [Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting](defender-experts-for-hunting.md), you're also assigned two **Ask Defender Experts** credits on the first of each month, which you may use to submit questions. You can still submit inquiries beyond the initial number of allocated credits. Unused credits expire 90 days from date of assignment or at the end of the subscription term, whichever is shortest.

## Service availability and data protection

The following sections enumerate additional information about the service's data usage, compliance, and availability.
