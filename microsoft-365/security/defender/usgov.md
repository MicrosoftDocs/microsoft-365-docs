# Microsoft 365 Defender for US Government customers

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Microsoft 365 Defender for US Government customers, built in the Azure US Government environment, uses the same underlying technologies as Microsoft 365 Defender in Azure Commercial.

This offering is available to GCC, GCC High, and DoD customers and is based on the same prevention, detection, investigation, and remediation as the commercial version. However, there are some differences in the availability of capabilities for this offering.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a GCC customer using Defender for Cloud Apps, Defender for Endpoint, or Defender for Identity in Commercial, you need to transition those services to their GCC versions to be eligible for Microsoft 365 Defender GCC.
