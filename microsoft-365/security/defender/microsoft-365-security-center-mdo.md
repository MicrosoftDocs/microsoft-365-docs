[Microsoft 365 Defender](./microsoft-365-defender.md) at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank"><https://security.microsoft.com></a> combines security capabilities from existing Microsoft security portals, including the Security & Compliance Center. This improved center helps security teams protect their organization from threats more effectively and efficiently.

If you are familiar with the Security & Compliance Center (protection.office.com), this article describes some of the changes and improvements in Microsoft 365 Defender.

If you are looking for compliance-related items, visit the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149" target="_blank">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.

## New and improved capabilities

The left navigation, or quick launch bar, will look familiar. However, there are some new and updated elements in this Defender for Cloud.

With the unified Microsoft 365 Defender solution, you can stitch together the threat signals and determine the full scope and impact of the threat, and how it's currently impacting the organization.

Defender for Office 365 safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/Defender-for-O365.png" alt-text="The Defender for Office 365 portal" lightbox="../../media/Defender-for-O365.png":::

### Incidents and alerts

Brings together incident and alert management across your email, devices, and identities. Alerts are now available under the Investigation node, and help provide a broader view of an attack. The alert page provides full context to the alert, by combining attack signals to construct a detailed story. Previously, alerts were specific to different workloads. A new, unified experience now brings together a consistent view of alerts across workloads. You can quickly triage, investigate, and take effective action.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-1-alerts-and-actions.png" alt-text="Alerts and Actions quick launch bar in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/converge-1-alerts-and-actions.png":::

### Hunting

Proactively search for threats, malware, and malicious activity across your endpoints, Office 365 mailboxes, and more by using [advanced hunting queries](advanced-hunting-overview.md). These powerful queries can be used to  locate and review threat indicators and entities for both known and potential threats.

[Custom detection rules](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/custom-detection-rules) can be built from advanced hunting queries to help you proactively watch for events that might be indicative of breach activity and misconfigured devices.

Here is an [example on advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-example.md) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

### Action center

Action center shows you the investigations created by automated investigation and response capabilities. This automated, self-healing in Microsoft 365 Defender can help security teams by automatically responding to specific events.

Learn more about [Action center](m365d-action-center.md).

#### Threat Analytics

Get threat intelligence from expert Microsoft security researchers. Threat Analytics helps security teams be more efficient when facing emerging threats. Threat Analytics includes:

- Email-related detections and mitigations from Microsoft Defender for Office 365. This is in addition to the endpoint data already available from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Incidents view related to the threats.
- Enhanced experience for quickly identifying and using actionable information in the reports.

You can access Threat analytics either from the upper left navigation bar in Microsoft 365 Defender, or from a dedicated dashboard card that shows the top threats for your organization.

Learn more about how to [track and respond to emerging threats with threat analytics](./threat-analytics.md).

### Email & collaboration

Track and investigate threats to your users' email, track campaigns, and more. If you've used the Security & Compliance Center, this will be familiar.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-3-email-and-collab-new.png" alt-text="The quick launch menu for Email & Collab (or MSDO), on the left navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/converge-3-email-and-collab-new.png":::

#### Email entity page

The [Email entity page](../office-365-security/mdo-email-entity-page.md) *unifies* email information that had been scattered across different pages or views in the past. Investigating email for threats and trends is *centralized*. Header information and email preview are accessible through the same email page, along with other useful email-related information. Likewise, the detonation status for malicious file attachments or URLs can be found on a tab of the same page. The Email entity page empowers admins and security operations teams to understand an email threat and its status, fast, and then act quickly determine handling.

### Access and Reports

View reports, change your settings, and modify user roles.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-4-access-and-reporting-new.png" alt-text="The quick launch menu for Microsoft 365 Defender permissions and reporting, on the left navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal" lightbox="../../media/converge-4-access-and-reporting-new.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) ensures that destination email systems trust messages sent outbound from your custom domain.
> For Defender for Office 365 users, you can now *manage and rotate* DKIM keys through Microsoft 365 Defender: <https://security.microsoft.com/threatpolicy>, or navigate to **Policy & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> \> **Rules** section \> **DKIM**.
>
> For more information, see [Use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> combines security features in <https://securitycenter.windows.com>, and <https://protection.office.com>. However, what you see will depend on your subscription. If you only have Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2, as standalone subscriptions, for example, you won't see capabilities around Security for Endpoints and Defender for Office Plan 1 customers won't see items such as Threat Analytics.

> [!TIP]
> All Exchange Online Protection (EOP) functions will be included in Microsoft 365 Defender, as EOP is a core element of Defender for Office 365.

## Microsoft 365 Defender Home page

The Home page of the portal surfaces important summary information about the security status of your Microsoft 365 environment.

Using the **Guided tour** you can take a quick tour of Endpoint or Email & collaboration pages. Note that what you see here will depend on if you have license for Defender for Office 365 and/or Defender for Endpoint.

Also included is a link to the Security & Compliance Center for comparison. The last link is to the **What's New** page that describes recent updates.
