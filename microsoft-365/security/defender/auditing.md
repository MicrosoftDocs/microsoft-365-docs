# Auditing

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](microsoft-365-defender.md)

As a tenant administrator, you can use Microsoft Purview to search the audit logs for the times Microsoft Defender Experts signed into your tenant and the actions they did there to perform their investigations. You can also search the audit logs for the changes done by your tenant administrators to the Defender Experts settings.

[Audit (Standard)](/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-solutions-overview) is turned on by default for all Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR customers when paid licenses are assigned to the tenant. If you have a trial license, work with your service delivery manager to turn on Audit if it isn't yet.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the right [permissions](/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-log-search#before-you-search-the-audit-log) to search for audit logs.
