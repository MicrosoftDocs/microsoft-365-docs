# Alert grading playbooks

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Alert grading playbooks allow you to methodically review and quickly classify the alerts for well-known attacks and take recommended actions to remediate the attack and protect your network. Alert grading will also help in properly classifying the overall incident.

As a security researcher or security operations center (SOC) analyst, you must have access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal so that you can:

- Assess and review the generated alerts and associated incidents. See [investigate alerts](investigate-alerts.md).
- Search your tenant's security signal data and check for potential threats and suspicious activities. See [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md).

>[!Note]
>You can provide feedback to Microsoft about true positive and false positives alerts, not only at the end of the investigation, but also during the investigation process. This can help Microsoft with future analysis and classification of security events.
