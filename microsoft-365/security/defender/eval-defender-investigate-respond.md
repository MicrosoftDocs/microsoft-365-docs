# Step 6. Investigate and respond using Microsoft Defender XDR in a pilot environment

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR

This article outlines the process to create incidents with attack simulations and tutorials and use Microsoft Defender XDR to investigate and respond. Before starting this process, be sure you've reviewed the overall process for [evaluating Microsoft Defender XDR](eval-overview.md) and you have [created the Microsoft Defender XDR evaluation environment](eval-create-eval-environment.md).

Use the following steps.

The following table describes the steps in the illustration.

|Step|Description|
|---------|---------|
|1. [Simulate attacks](eval-defender-investigate-respond-simulate-attack.md)|Simulate attacks on your evaluation environment and use the Microsoft Defender portal to perform incident response.|
|2. [Try incident response capabilities](eval-defender-investigate-respond-additional.md)|Try additional incident response features and capabilities in Microsoft Defender XDR.|
