# What's new in Microsoft Secure Score

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

To make Microsoft Secure Score a better representative of your security posture, we continue to add new features and improvement actions.

### Microsoft Secure Score integration with Microsoft Lighthouse 365

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) grow their business and deliver services to customers at scale from a single portal. Lighthouse allows customers to standardize configurations, manage risk, identify artificial intelligence (AI)-driven sales opportunities, and engage with customers to help them maximize their investment in Microsoft 365.

We've integrated Microsoft Secure Score into Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. This integration provides an aggregate view of the Secure Score across all managed tenants, and Secure Score details for each individual tenant. Access to Secure Score is available from a new card on the Lighthouse homepage or by selecting a tenant on the Lighthouse Tenants page.

> [!NOTE]
> The integration with Microsoft Lighthouse 365 is available to Microsoft partners who use the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program to manage customer tenants.

### Microsoft Secure Score permissions integration with Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC) is now in Public Preview

Previously, only Microsoft Entra global roles (such as Global Administrators) could access Microsoft Secure Score. Now, you can control access and grant granular permissions for the Microsoft Secure Score experience as part of the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model.

You can add the new permission and choose the data sources the user has access to by selecting the **Security posture** permissions group when creating the role. For more information, see [Create custom roles with Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](./create-custom-rbac-roles.md). Users see Secure Score data for the data sources they have permissions to.

A new data source **Secure Score – Additional data source** is also available. Users with permissions to this data source have access to additional data within the Secure score dashboard. For more information on additional data sources, see [Products included in Secure Score](./microsoft-secure-score.md#products-included-in-secure-score).
