The `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` table in the advanced hunting schema contains the [Threat & Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) list of vulnerabilities in installed software products. This table also includes operating system information, CVE IDs, and vulnerability severity information. You can use this table, for example, to hunt for events involving devices that have severe vulnerabilities in their software. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

>[!NOTE]
> The `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory` and `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` tables have replaced the `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities` table. Together, the first two tables include more columns you can use to help inform your vulnerability management activities or hunt for vulnerable devices.
