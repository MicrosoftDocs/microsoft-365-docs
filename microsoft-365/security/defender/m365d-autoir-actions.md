# View and manage actions in the Action center

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Threat protection features in Microsoft 365 Defender can result in certain remediation actions. Here are some examples:

- [Automated investigations](m365d-autoir.md) can result in remediation actions that are taken automatically or await your approval.
- Antivirus, antimalware, and other threat protection features can result in remediation actions, such as blocking a file, URL, or process, or sending an artifact to quarantine.
- Your security operations team can take remediation actions manually, such as during [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) or while investigating [alerts](investigate-alerts.md) or [incidents](investigate-incidents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have [appropriate permissions](m365d-action-center.md#required-permissions-for-action-center-tasks) to approve or reject remediation actions. For more information, see the [prerequisites](m365d-configure-auto-investigation-response.md#prerequisites-for-automated-investigation-and-response-in-microsoft-365-defender).

To navigate to the Action center, take one of the following steps:

- Go to [https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center); or
- In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), in the Automated investigation & response card, select **Approve in Action Center**.

## Review pending actions in the Action center

It's important to approve (or reject) pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations can proceed and complete in a timely manner. 

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> and sign in. 

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**. 

3. In the Action center, on the **Pending** tab, select an item in the list. Its flyout pane opens. Here's an example.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/air-actioncenter-itemselected.png" alt-text="The options to approve or reject an action" lightbox="../../media/air-actioncenter-itemselected.png":::

4. Review the information in the flyout pane, and then take one of the following steps:
   - Select **Open investigation page** to view more details about the investigation.
   - Select **Approve** to initiate a pending action.
   - Select **Reject** to prevent a pending action from being taken.
   - Select **Go hunt** to go into [Advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md). 

## Undo completed actions

If you've determined that a device or a file is not a threat, you can undo remediation actions that were taken, whether those actions were taken automatically or manually. In the Action center, on the **History** tab, you can undo any of the following actions:  

| Action source | Supported Actions |
|:---|:---|
| - Automated investigation <br/>- Microsoft Defender Antivirus <br/>- Manual response actions | - Isolate device <br/>- Restrict code execution <br/>- Quarantine a file <br/>- Remove a registry key <br/>- Stop a service <br/>- Disable a driver <br/>- Remove a scheduled task |

2. On the **History** tab, select the actions that you want to undo. Make sure to select items that have the same Action type. A flyout pane opens.

3. In the flyout pane, select **Undo**.

### To remove a file from quarantine across multiple devices
