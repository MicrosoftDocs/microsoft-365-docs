The `DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware` table in the advanced hunting schema contains hardware and firmware information of devices as checked by [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt). The information includes the system model, processor, and BIOS, among others.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).

| Column name | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `DeviceId` | `string` | Unique identifier for the device in the service |
| `DeviceName` | `string` | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the device |
| `ComponentType` | `string` | Type of hardware or firmware component |
| `Manufacturer` | `string` | Manufacturer of hardware or firmware component |
| `ComponentName` | `string` | Name of hardware or firmware component |
| `ComponentFamily` | `string` | Component family or class, a grouping of components that have similar features or characteristics as determined by the manufacturer |
| `ComponentVersion` | `string` | Component version (for example, BIOS version) |
| `AdditionalFields` | `string` | Additional information about the components in JSON array format|

You can try the following sample queries to use the information available in the `DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware` table:

```kusto
// Count the number of Lenovo devices
DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware
| where ComponentType == "Hardware" and Manufacturer == "lenovo"
| summarize count()
```

```kusto
// Find all devices with a specific BIOS version, replace ComponentVersion with what you are looking for
DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware
| where ComponentType == "Bios" and ComponentVersion contains "N2VET29W"
|project DeviceId, DeviceName
```
