# Incident response in the Microsoft Defender portal

An *incident* in the Microsoft Defender portal is a collection of related alerts and associated data that make up the story of an attack. It's also a case file that your SOC can use to investigate that attack and manage, implement, and document the response to it.

The Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender services create alerts when they detect a suspicious or malicious event or activity. Individual alerts provide valuable evidence of a completed or ongoing attack. However, increasingly prevalent and sophisticated attacks typically employ a variety of techniques and vectors against different types of asset entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes. The result is multiple alerts, from multiple sources, for multiple asset entities in your digital estate.

Because individual alerts each tell only part of the story, and because manually grouping individual alerts together to gain insight into an attack can be challenging and time-consuming, the unified security operations platform automatically identifies alerts that are related&mdash;from both Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR&mdash;and aggregates them and their associated information into an incident.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents.png" alt-text="How Microsoft Defender XDR correlates events from entities into an incident." lightbox="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents.png":::

Grouping related alerts into an incident gives you a comprehensive view of an attack. For example, you can see:

- Where the attack started.
- What tactics were used.
- How far the attack has gone into your digital estate.
- The scope of the attack, such as how many devices, users, and mailboxes were impacted.
- All of the data associated with the attack.

The unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal includes methods to automate and assist in the triage, investigation, and resolution of incidents.

- [Microsoft Copilot in Defender](security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender.md) harnesses AI to support analysts with complex and time-consuming daily workflows, including end-to-end incident investigation and response with clearly described attack stories, step-by-step actionable remediation guidance and incident activity summarized reports, natural language KQL hunting, and expert code analysis&mdash;optimizing on SOC efficiency across Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR data.

    This capability is in addition to the other AI-based functionality that Microsoft Sentinel brings to the unified platform, in the areas of user and entity behavior analytics, anomaly detection, multi-stage threat detection, and more.

- Automated attack disruption uses high-confidence signals collected from Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel to automatically disrupt active attacks at machine speed, containing the threat and limiting the impact.

- If [enabled](m365d-enable.md), Microsoft Defender XDR can [automatically investigate and resolve](m365d-autoir.md) alerts from Microsoft 365 and Entra ID sources through automation and artificial intelligence. You can also perform additional remediation steps to resolve the attack.

- Microsoft Sentinel [automation rules](/azure/sentinel/automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules) can automate triage, assignment, and management of incidents, regardless of their source. They can apply tags to incidents based on their content, suppress noisy (false positive) incidents, and close resolved incidents that meet the appropriate criteria, specifying a reason and adding comments.

## Incidents and alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal

> [!TIP]
> For a limited time during January 2024, when you visit the **Incidents** page, Defender Boxed appears. Defender Boxed highlights your organization's security successes, improvements, and response actions during 2023. To reopen Defender Boxed, in the Microsoft Defender portal, go to **Incidents**, and then select **Your Defender Boxed**.

You manage incidents from **Investigation & response > Incidents & alerts > Incidents** on the quick launch of the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). Here's an example:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-ss-incidents.png" alt-text="The Incidents page in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-ss-incidents.png":::

Selecting an incident name displays the incident page, starting with the entire **attack story** of the incident, including:

- **Alert page within incident**: The scope of alerts related to the incident and their information on the same tab.

- **Graph**: A visual representation of the attack that connects the different suspicious entities that are part of the attack with the asset entities that make up the attack's targets, such as users, devices, apps, and mailboxes.

You can view the asset and other entity details directly from the graph and act on them with response options such as like disabling an account, deleting a file, or isolating a device.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-overview/incident-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the attack story page for an incident in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/incidents-overview/incident-summary.png":::

The incident page consists of the following tabs:

- **Attack story**

  Mentioned above, this tab includes the timeline of the attack, including all the alerts, asset entities, and remediation actions taken.

- **Alerts**

  All the alerts related to the incident, their sources, and information.

- **Assets**

  All the assets (protected entities such as devices, users, mailboxes, apps, and cloud resources) that have been identified to be part of or related to the incident.

- **Investigations**

  All the [automated investigations](m365d-autoir.md) triggered by alerts in the incident, including the status of the investigations and their results.

- **Evidence and Response**

  All the suspicious entities in the alerts of the incident, which constitute evidence supporting the attack story. These entities can include IP addresses, files, processes, URLs, registry keys and values, and more.

- **Summary**

  A quick overview of the impacted assets associated with alerts.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see an *Unsupported alert type* alert status, it means that automated investigation capabilities cannot pick up that alert to run an automated investigation. However, you can [investigate these alerts manually](investigate-incidents.md#alerts).

## Incident response workflow example in the Microsoft Defender portal

Here's a workflow example for responding to incidents in Microsoft 365 with the Microsoft Defender portal.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-example-workflow.png" alt-text="An example of an incident response workflow for the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="../../media/incidents-overview/incidents-example-workflow.png":::

On an ongoing basis, identify the highest priority incidents for analysis and resolution in the incident queue and get them ready for response. This is a combination of:

- [Triaging](incident-queue.md) to determining the highest priority incidents through filtering and sorting of the incident queue.
- [Managing](manage-incidents.md) incidents by modifying their title, assigning them to an analyst, and adding tags and comments.

You can use Microsoft Sentinel automation rules to automatically triage and manage (and even respond to) some incidents as they're created, removing the easiest-to-handle incidents from taking up space in your queue.

Consider these steps for your own incident response workflow:

| Stage | Steps |
| ----- | ----- |
| For each incident, begin an [attack and alert investigation and analysis](investigate-incidents.md). | <ol><li> View the attack story of the incident to understand its scope, severity, detection source, and which asset entities are affected.<li>Begin analyzing the alerts to understand their origin, scope, and severity with the alert story within the incident.<li>As needed, gather information on impacted devices, users, and mailboxes with the graph. Select any entity to open a flyout with all the details. Follow through to the entity page for more insights.<li>See how Microsoft Defender XDR has [automatically resolved some alerts](m365d-autoir.md) with the **Investigations** tab.<li>As needed, use information in the data set for the incident for more information with the **Evidence and Response** tab. |
| After or during your analysis, perform containment to reduce any additional impact of the attack and eradication of the security threat. | For example,<li>Disable compromised users<li>Isolate impacted devices<li>Block hostile IP addresses. |
| As much as possible, recover from the attack by restoring your tenant resources to the state they were in before the incident.||
| [Resolve](manage-incidents.md#resolve-an-incident) the incident and document your findings. | Take time for post-incident learning to: <li>Understand the type of the attack and its impact.<li>Research the attack in [Threat Analytics](threat-analytics.md) and the security community for a security attack trend.<li>Recall the workflow you used to resolve the incident and update your standard workflows, processes, policies, and playbooks as needed.<li>Determine whether changes in your security configuration are needed and implement them. |

If you're new to security analysis, see the [introduction to responding to your first incident](incidents-overview.md) for additional information and to step through an example incident.
