Microsoft Defender XDR provides integrated threat protection, detection, and response across endpoints, email, identities, applications, and data within a single portal. Controlling a user's permissions around their access to view data or complete tasks is essential for organizations to minimize the risks associated with unauthorized access.

The Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC) model provides a single permissions management experience that provides one central location for administrators to control user permissions across different security solutions.

## Before you start

This section provides useful information on what you need to know before you start using Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC.

### Permissions pre-requisites

- You must be a Global Administrator or Security Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID to:
  - Gain initial access to [Permissions and roles](https://security.microsoft.com/mtp_roles) in the Microsoft Defender portal.

  - Manage roles and permissions in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC.

  - Create a custom role that can grant access to security groups or individual users to manage roles and permissions in Microsoft Defender XDR unified RBAC. This will remove the need for Microsoft Entra global roles to manage permissions. To do this you need assign the **Authorization** permission in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC. For details on how to assign the Authorization permission, see [Create a role to access and manage roles and permissions](../defender/create-custom-rbac-roles.md#create-a-role-to-access-and-manage-roles-and-permissions).

- The Microsoft Defender XDR security solution will continue to respect existing Microsoft Entra global roles when you activate the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model for some or all of your workloads i.e. Global Admins will retain assigned admin privileges.

### Migration of existing roles and permissions

The new Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model provides easy migration of the existing permissions in the individual supported unified RBAC models to the new RBAC model.

All permissions listed within the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model align to permissions in the individual RBAC models to ensure backward compatibility. For more information on how the permissions align, see [Map permissions in Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control (RBAC)](compare-rbac-roles.md).

### Activation of the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model

You must activate the workloads in Microsoft Defender XDR to use the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model. Until activated, Microsoft Defender XDR will continue to respect the existing RBAC models. For more information, see [Activate Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](activate-defender-rbac.md).

When you activate some or all of your workloads to use the new permission model, the roles and permissions for these workloads will be fully controlled by the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model in the Microsoft Defender portal.
