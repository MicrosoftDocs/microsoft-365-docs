# Overview of Loop workspaces storage and permissions

Where the loop content was originally created determines its storage location. See the [Loop Storage](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary#loop-storage) section in [Summary of governance, lifecycle and compliance capabilities](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary) for Loop for a diagram and more information.

## Loop app's usage of organization's storage quota

Loop app workspaces are stored inside your tenant. Loop workspaces and pages count against your tenant's storage quota, starting November 2023. (Note that during the Loop app's Public Preview in 2023, Loop app content did **not** use your existing storage quota.)

## Content permissions mechanism

Each Loop app workspace uses storage for the workspace in [SharePoint Embedded](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-premium-blog/announcing-sharepoint-embedded-public-preview-at-espc23/ba-p/3993428). Additionally, the Loop app creates a roster for that workspace to govern access to the full workspace. When pages are shared from the workspace, we create a sharing link using your company's default sharing link type as configured for OneDrive and SharePoint.

Sharing the workspace in Loop adds the user to the workspace roster. All workspace roster members have access and "*editing*" permissions to all the Loop pages in that workspace.

There's a distinction between sharing a specific Loop page with a user versus inviting them to a Workspace.

When you invite a user to a workspace, that user has access to all the pages in that workspace. Loop only supports inviting users to a workspace via this Workspace roster management flow, which enables access and sends an email invite to the invited users.

When you share only a Loop page, you're giving users access to that specific page exclusively (not the whole workspace). The user can choose to use a company share link or people-specific share link; unless their tenant admin has disabled some of the share link types. When sharing a page, you can choose to grant the user "*edit*" or "*read only*" access.

## Loop workspace membership and Microsoft 365 groups

Loop workspaces currently have one type, with membership visible and manageable within the Loop app by the workspace owner. However, there is no integration with Microsoft 365 groups or Security groups.

At present, owners cannot assign new members as owners. If the owner leaves the company, the workspace becomes ownerless. Administrators cannot assign new owners to ownerless workspaces.

PowerShell support for number of owners on a SharePoint Embedded container is not yet available. Once it is, to find ownerless workspaces, query Loop workspace containers in SharePoint Embedded. For more information, see [Consuming Tenant Admin](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/cta), and [Get-SPO Container](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spocontainer). The Loop Application ID is listed in [Summary of governance, lifecycle and compliance capabilities](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary).

Note that there are other types of groups and membership lists in the Microsoft ecosystem, such as Microsoft 365 groups and Security groups. Currently, Loop workspace membership cannot be managed by or associated with these groups or lists.

## Storage management after user departure

### In the Loop app

The Loop app is designed for shared workspaces and personal workspaces.

Shared workspaces are backed by a roster and continue to exist even if someone leaves the company. However, if the creator of the workspace is the person who left the company, then others can't delete the workspace. 

Personal workspaces are also backed by a roster, but there's only one person in them by design. When a user leaves a company, their personal workspaces become ownerless.

### In Loop components created in Microsoft 365 outside of the Loop app

Loop components created outside of the Loop are stored in the OneDrive of the person who created the component. Therefore, if that user leaves the organization, the standard OneDrive IT policy is applied.

## Management of Loop app's storage

See [Admin Management of Loop workspaces](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary#admin-management-of-loop-workspaces) section of the [Summary of governance, lifecycle and compliance capabilities](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary) for more information.
