# Summary of governance, lifecycle and compliance capabilities for Loop

As a Compliance Manager or IT administrator, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest governance, data lifecycle, and compliance posture for the software solutions being used in your organization. This article details the capabilities available and not available yet for [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

## Loop Storage

Where Loop content is stored impacts the admin management, governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities available. Microsoft Loop is built on top of SharePoint, OneDrive, and [Microsoft Syntex repository services](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-syntex-repository-services-microsoft-365-superpowers-for-your-app/), which means that most of these capabilities work just like existing files in your ecosystem. Because Loop pages and components are files, they can be managed in a familiar way, within your existing workflows. To help you understand how Loop content is stored in the Microsoft ecosystem, here's a high-level diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/loop-files-sharepoint.png" alt-text="Diagram showing that the place a Loop file is stored depends on where it was originally created.":::

Where the loop content was originally created determines its storage location:
- Created in the Loop app ➡️️ Microsoft Syntex
- Created outside the Loop app in places that have dedicated shared storage (e.g. Teams channels) ➡️️ SharePoint
- Created outside the Loop app in all other places that don't have tightly associated collaborative storage (e.g. Teams chat, Outlook email, Word for the web, Whiteboard) ➡️️ OneDrive

## Summary of governance, data lifecycle and compliance capabilities not yet available

This section repeats capabilities which aren't yet available from the table above to make it easier to evaluate the smaller list of capabilities your organization might require before using Microsoft Loop. As denoted in the summary table, the majority of the content in this section 'applies to Loop workspaces only, unless **noted.

### Admin Management
- **Programmatic APIs for Loop workspace content**: API access to Loop workspace containers isn't yet available. These APIs are required in order to use third party tools for export and eDiscovery, migration, communicate in bulk to end-users about their content such as compliance requirements, and developer APIs.
- **Multi-Geo** rehome of Loop workspaces and all contained .loop files isn't yet available.
- When users delete an entire Loop workspace, or when they delete pages or components stored in a Loop workspace, these aren't yet available in an **end-user visible Recycle bin**.
- See [Admin Management of Loop workspaces](#admin-management-of-loop-workspaces) for a more detailed list of specific admin capabilities using PowerShell and the SharePoint Admin Center.

### Data Lifecycle Management
- While Retention policies are enforced if configured at the *all SharePoint site* level, **setting or overriding the *all SharePoint sites* Retention policy on an individual Loop workspace** isn't yet available.
- Retention labels aren't yet available for Loop workspace content.

### Data Loss Prevention, Information Protection
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules are enforced on all Loop content, but **DLP policy tips** aren't yet displayed for **ANY Loop experiences.
- **Sensitivity Labeling (MIP/CLP)** isn't yet supported for **ANY Loop content.

**This applies to ALL Loop content, both content stored in OneDrive or SharePoint AND content stored in Microsoft Syntex repository services.


## Admin Management of Loop workspaces

This section provides expanded information on the subset of admin management capabilities dedicated to Loop workspaces stored in Microsoft Syntex. The Loop ApplicationID which can be used to identify Loop workspace containers is: `a187e399-0c36-4b98-8f04-1edc167a0996`  

### Admin Management Capabilities Available

Admins can perform the following tasks for Loop workspaces, which are containers in Microsoft Syntex repository service.
- PowerShell ability to
  - enumeration of list of Loop workspaces created
  - get container details including labels, storage, owners etc.
  - delete, recover and purge deleted Loop workspaces
  - set sharing settings at a tenant level

See more about how to use PowerShell to perform these tasks in the [Microsoft Syntex admin management documentation](/microsoft-365/syntex/powershell-syntex-intro).

## Manually Initializing Microsoft Loop app for Conditional Access management in Microsoft Entra

In order to select Microsoft Loop app from the cloud app target UX in the Microsoft Entra admin center | Protection | Conditional Access | Select what this policy applies to | select apps | Microsoft Loop, manual provisioning is required.

1. [Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell - Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Microsoft Learn](/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell)
1. Copy/Paste this and hit Enter on this command:

   ```PowerShell
   New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AccountEnabled $true -AppId a187e399-0c36-4b98-8f04-1edc167a0996 -AppRoleAssignmentRequired $false -DisplayName "Microsoft Loop app" -Tags {WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp}
