# Summary of compliance capabilities for Loop

Loop experiences offer many compliance features. This article provides a summary of the compliance features frequently requested that are **not available** yet in Loop.

## Summary of compliance capabilities for Loop components

Loop components created outside of the Loop app in other Microsoft 365 apps (such as [Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/first-things-to-know-about-loop-components-in-microsoft-teams-ee2a584b-5785-4dd6-8a2d-956131a29c81), [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-loop-components-in-outlook-9b47c279-011d-4042-bd7f-8bbfca0cb136), [Whiteboard](https://support.microsoft.com/office/loop-components-in-whiteboard-c5f08f54-995e-473e-be6e-7f92555da347), [Word for the web](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-loop-components-in-word-for-the-web-645cc20d-5c98-4bdb-b559-380c5a27c5e5)) are stored in the creator's OneDrive. For example, if User A creates a Loop component within a Teams chat with User B, that Loop component is stored in User A's OneDrive and is shared with User B.

Because Loop components are stored as files in OneDrive, there are many capabilities you're already familiar with that function just like any other file in OneDrive of SharePoint. Here are the notable differences from Office files in OneDrive that are **not available** yet for Loop components:

- [Sensitivity Labeling](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection) (Microsoft Information Protection) at the File-level
- End-user ability to see [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp) policy tips
- [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)

To configure Loop components in your organization, see [Manage Loop components in OneDrive and SharePoint](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-components-configuration).

## Summary of compliance capabilities for content created in Loop workspaces

Content created in a Loop workspace is stored in Microsoft Syntex repository services. For more information, see [Introducing Microsoft Syntex repository services: Microsoft 365 superpowers for your app](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-syntex-repository-services-microsoft-365-superpowers-for-your-app/).

Microsoft Syntex repository services has many of the same compliance capabilities as the rest of SharePoint and OneDrive. However, the capabilities below are **not available** yet for content created in Loop workspaces. While we continue to improve rapidly in this area, if you require any of these capabilities, Microsoft recommends proactively disabling Loop workspaces using the instructions in [Manage Loop workspaces in Microsoft Syntex repository services](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-configuration):

- [Intune Device Management Support](/mem/intune/remote-actions/device-management)
- Tenant admin experience: Restoring a deleted workspace
- End-user ability to see or set [Retention Labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/retention-policies-sharepoint)
- [Sensitivity Labeling](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection) (Microsoft Information Protection) at the File-level and Container-level
- End-user ability to see [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp) policy tips
- Multiple owners on a workspace
- [Multi-Geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) support
- [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) 

*This list of capabilities is not exhaustive*

> [!NOTE]
> The list of capabilities in this section applies to content created in Loop workspaces (Microsoft Syntex repository services). It does not apply to Loop components created in either Teams, Outlook, Whiteboard or Word for the web (which are created in OneDrive).

To configure Loop workspaces in your organization, see [Manage Loop workspaces in Microsoft Syntex repository services](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-configuration)
