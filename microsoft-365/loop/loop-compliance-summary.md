# Summary of governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities for Loop

As a Compliance Manager or IT administrator, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest governance, data lifecycle, and compliance posture for the software solutions being used in your organization. This article details the capabilities available and not available yet for [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

## Loop Storage

Where Loop content is stored impacts the admin management, governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities available. Microsoft Loop is built on top of SharePoint, OneDrive, and [SharePoint Embedded](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-premium-blog/announcing-sharepoint-embedded-public-preview-at-espc23/ba-p/3993428), which means that most of these capabilities work just like existing files in your ecosystem. Because Loop pages and components are files, they can be managed in a familiar way, within your existing workflows. The table should help clarify how Loop content is stored in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Where the Loop content was originally created determines its storage location:

|Loop content originally created in|️️️Loop content stored in SharePoint Embedded|Loop content stored in SharePoint Site|Loop content stored in User's OneDrive|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Loop app|✔️in Loop workspace|||
|Teams channel meeting||✔️in Channel folder||
|Teams channel||✔️in Channel folder||
|Teams private chat|||✔️in Microsoft Teams Chat files folder|
|Teams private meeting|||✔️in Meetings folder|
|Outlook email message|||✔️in Attachments folder|
|OneNote for Windows or for the web|||✔️in OneNote Loop files folder|
|Whiteboard|||✔️in Whiteboard\Components folder|
|Word for the web (Preview only)|||✔️in Word Loop files folder|


## Summary table of admin management, governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities based on where Loop content is stored
|Category|OneDrive or SharePoint|SharePoint Embedded|
|-----|-----|-----|
|  |This column applies to Loop content:  <ul><li>Created in all other places that don't have tightly associated collaborative storage (e.g. Teams chat, Outlook email, Word for the web, Whiteboard) ➡️️ in the creator's OneDrive  <li>Created in places that have dedicated shared storage (e.g. Teams channels) ➡️️ SharePoint  </ul>|This column applies to Loop content:  <ul><li>Created inside the Loop app: Workspaces, Ideas ➡️ in SharePoint Embedded, one container per Loop workspace  </ul>|

|Admin toggles  |**[Admin Toggles](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-components-configuration#available-policy-settings)** exist to turn on or off creation of and live rendering of Loop components in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

There's also an additional toggle to turn on or off Loop components for collaborative meeting notes.  <br><br>Organizations with eCommunication regulations can choose to leave Loop components on across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem while using the independent toggles for communication tools during evaluation of Loop's data lifecycle, governance, and compliance capabilities.|**[Admin Toggle](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-configuration)** exists to turn on or off creation of content stored in SharePoint Embedded.

## Summary of governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities **not yet available**

### Available admin capabilities

For detailed information on existing capabilities in SharePoint Admin Center and PowerShell:
  - Available: [Manage SharePoint Embedded containers in SharePoint Admin Center](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/consuming-tenant-admin/ctaux)
  - Available: [SharePoint Embedded container management in PowerShell](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/consuming-tenant-admin/ctapowershell)

### Not yet available

The following sections detail capabilities that are **not yet available** for Microsoft Loop to make it easier to evaluate the smaller list of capabilities your organization might require before using Microsoft Loop. As denoted in the summary table, the content applies to Loop workspaces only.

### Programmatic APIs not yet available
- **Programmatic APIs for Loop workspace content**: API access to Loop workspace containers isn't yet available. These APIs are required in order to use third party tools for export and eDiscovery, migration, communicating in bulk to end-users about their content such as compliance requirements, and developer APIs.

### Admin Management not yet available

- When users delete an entire Loop workspace, that Loop workspace isn't available in an **end-user visible Recycle bin**. Furthermore, restoring the Loop workspace using admin tooling doesn't update in the Loop app user experience. The user would need to visit a saved page link for a workspace that's restored in order to see it again.
- When an **admin deletes** a Loop workspace, it **will not be removed from the user's view** of Loop workspaces. When users click on the deleted Loop workspace, it displays an error.
- When an **admin modifies the list of owners or members** of a Loop workspace through the SharePoint Admin Center or via PowerShell, the **changes won't be visible to the users within that Loop workspace**. Changes to the workspace membership are only updated in the user's view of the Loop app if they're made directly within the Loop app itself.
- All Loop workspaces are created as tenant-owned, in the tenant default geo. Loop does not create **user-owned workspace types**, so when an employee leaves the organization, their non-shared Loop workspaces such as Ideas become ownerless, remain in the tenant and are not automatically deleted.
- **Individual controls for guest or external sharing** of a specific Loop workspace isn't available.

### Records Management not yet available
- While Retention policies are enforced if configured at the *all SharePoint site* level, **setting or overriding the *all SharePoint sites* Retention policy on an individual Loop workspace** isn't yet available.
- Retention labels aren't yet available for Loop workspace content.

### Data Classification not yet available
- **Sensitivity Labeling** can't be configured at the Loop workspace level within the Loop app. It can be set using PowerShell per Loop workspace and viewed in the SharePoint Embedded admin center.
