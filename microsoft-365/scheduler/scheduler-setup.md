## Setting up the Scheduler assistant mailbox

Scheduler assistant mailbox is an Exchange equipment type mailbox that does not require an additional Microsoft 365 or Scheduler license. The display name and the primary SMTP address of the mailbox should contain Cortana since all the emails from the Scheduler assistant will be signed Cortana (i.e., `Cortana <cortana@yourdomain.com>` or `Cortana Scheduler <cortana.scheduler@yourdomain.com>`). After the Scheduler assistant mailbox has been created, you must designate the mailbox as the Scheduler assistant mailbox. After you designate the Scheduler assistant mailbox, Cortana will be available to schedule meetings on behalf of your users.

- Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create a user mailbox. A 30-day retention policy is recommended. 
- Use the name Cortana in your mailbox’s primary SMTP address. Names such as `Cortana@yourdomain.com`, `CortanaScheduler@contoso.com`, or `Cortana.Scheduler@yourdomain.com` are recommended.

## Designate the mailbox as the Scheduler Assistant

After a unique mailbox for Cortana Scheduler has been created, you must designate the mailbox to Microsoft 365 formally. After you designate the Cortana Scheduler mailbox, it will be available to schedule meetings on behalf of your users.

#### Connect to PowerShell

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create a user mailbox. A 30-day retention policy is recommended.
Use the name Cortana in your mailbox’s primary SMTP address. Names such as `Cortana@yourdomain.com`, `CortanaScheduler@contoso.com`, or `Cortana.Scheduler@yourdomain.com` are recommended.

```PowerShell
$domain="yourdomain.com  "
$tenantAdmin="<tenantadmin>@$domain"
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName $tenantAdmin
```

#### Create the Scheduler Assistant Mailbox

```PowerShell
New-Mailbox -Name Cortana -Organization $domain -DisplayName "Cortana Scheduler" -Equipment 
Set-CalendarProcessing Cortana@$domain -DeleteNonCalendarItems $false 
```
	
#### Designate the Scheduler Assistant Mailbox

```PowerShell
Set-mailbox cortana@$domain -SchedulerAssistant:$true
```

After running this "set" command on the Cortana Scheduler assistant mailbox, a new "PersistedCapability" is set on the mailbox to note that this mailbox is the "SchedulerAssistant".

> [!Note]
> To learn how to connect your organization to PowerShell, see: 
[Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell)

### Verifying the Scheduler assistant mailbox

To verify the Scheduler assistant mailbox has been created

```PowerShell
Get-CalendarProcessing cortana$domain <cortana>@microsoft.com   | fl DeleteNonCalendarItems`
```

The result should be “false”.

<br>

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -Identity <cortana>@microsoft.com$domain -Organization microsoft.com$domain | fl *type*
```

The result should be
- ResourceType: Equipment
- Remote RecipientType: None
- RecipientType: UserMailbox
- RecipientTypeDetails: EquipmentMailbox

<br/>

### To discover which mailbox is the Scheduler assistant mailbox

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | where {$_.PersistedCapabilities -Match "SchedulerAssistant"}
```

> [!Important]
> It might take several hours for the Scheduler assistant mailbox to complete full provisioning to set the SchedulerAssistant capability.


## Exchange Online mailbox

A Scheduler license is an add-on to Microsoft 365, which enables the meeting organizer to delegate their meeting scheduling tasks to their Scheduler assistant. In addition to designating a mailbox as a Scheduler assistant mailbox, meeting organizers will also need a Scheduler license and Exchange Online mailbox and calendar, typically through Microsoft 365 license for Scheduler to work. Meeting attendees do not need a Scheduler license or a Microsoft 365 license.
