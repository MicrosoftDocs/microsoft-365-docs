# Help your users install Office on Windows 10 devices

[![Label to let you know the admin center is changing and you can find more details at aka.ms/aboutM365preview.](../media/m365admincenterchanging.png)](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview)

You can quickly and easily install Office on Windows 10 PCs from the Microsoft 365 admin center.
