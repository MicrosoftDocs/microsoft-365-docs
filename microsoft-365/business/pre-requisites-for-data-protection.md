# Pre-requisites for protecting data on devices with Microsoft 365 Business

The first step in setting up your organization with Microsoft 365 Business is to make sure you are able to meet the pre-requisites.
  
## Pre-requisites

- Windows devices must be running Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro.
    
    [Upgrade Windows devices to Windows Pro Creators Update](upgrade-to-windows-pro-creators-update.md)
    
    If you are running Windows 10 Home, then you need to **purchase** Windows  10 Pro. See [upgrade Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro](https://support.office.com/article/0aee10c1-4d34-43ee-a325-579c6c2df90e?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) for instructions. 
    
- Remove devices from mobile management solutions (Mobile Iron, AirWatch, etc.). You will enroll all the people in your organization to Microsoft 365 Business mobile management.
    
- Apple iOS 8.0 and later.
    
    Google Android 4.0 and later (including Samsung KNOX Standard 4.0 and higher). For more details, see [Intune supported devices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852307).
    
- If you have existing Office applications on user computers, read [prepare for Office client installation](prepare-for-office-client-deployment.md) to understand steps you might have to take before you can set up Microsoft 365 Business to install Office 2016 to user computers.
