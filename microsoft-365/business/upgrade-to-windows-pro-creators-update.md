  - Select this option if the device that you're logged in is on the same device as the one you want to update.
  - From the software download site, click **Update now** to start upgrading the device to Windows 10 Pro Creators Update.

- Create an installation media using the [Media Creation Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836960) &ndash; Select this option to create a Windows 10 Pro Creators Update installation media (USB flash drive or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a PC that's different from the one you're using.
  - Read the instructions on how to use the tool and create your installation media.
