3. Choose **Upload**![Upload](media/d9b963b8-10af-42e2-953d-360301b83d3c.png) in the menu bar, and browse to the files you want to save. 
    
To transfer the user profile and important files, you can also use a third-party tool, such as ForensiT. You should upload the resulting files in OneDrive for Business also.
