# Validate app protection settings on Windows 10 PCs

## Verify that users cannot copy company data to personal files on corporate devices

After you [set up app protection policies](protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md), it may take up to a few hours for the policy to take effect on users' devices. If you turned **On** the **Prevent users from copying company data to personal files and force them to save work files to OneDrive for Business** setting for company owned devices, you can check this on the user's device after they've connected to Azure AD and signed in. 
  
 **Verify connection settings**
  
1. After you sign in with Microsoft 365 Business credentials and connect to Azure AD as described in [Set up Windows devices for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-windows-devices.md), go to **Windows Settings** \> **Accounts** \> **Access work or school**. Choose **Connected to \<tenant name\> Azure AD**, and then choose **Info**.
    
    ![Click or tap Info on the Connected to Azure AD dialog.](media/a36ede2b-d1a0-4d4e-8ea7-af39b4b63890.png)
  
2. On the **Managed by** \<tenant name\> page, you can see the **Connection info** that includes a **Management Server Address** like the one shown in the following figure.

 **Verify that you cannot paste company data in a non-managed app**
  
1. Open Outlook 2016 that was installed by Microsoft 365 Business.
    
2. Open an email and copy some content from it.
    
    Open Notepad and attempt to paste the content in.
    
    You'll receive an error that states the app can't access content.
    
    ![A dialog that states app can't access content when you paste into an unmanaged app.](media/5e82b154-cf2f-43c8-ae80-b45d8ad80e56.png)
  
    You can, however, paste the same content into Word 2016.
