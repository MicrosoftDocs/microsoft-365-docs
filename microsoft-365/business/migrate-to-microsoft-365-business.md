# Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business Premium from Microsoft 365 Business Standard

If you have a [Microsoft 365 for business subscription](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products-4-column?activetab=tab:primaryr2), for example, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, you can easily upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business Premium if you want to add:

- Windows 10 Pro (to PCs running Windows 8 or later)

- Simple controls that manage business data on devices

- Advanced security capabilities.
Find out more about Microsoft 365 Business Premium at [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business)

## What's the difference between Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Microsoft 365 Business Premium?

We've added a side-by-side comparison of these two plans to the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-business-service-description). 

## Before you get started

- **When should I choose to upgrade?** Upgrade is the right choice when you want to upgrade **all users** assigned to a single plan. When you choose upgrade, all plan users get switched to another plan at the same time. If you don't want to upgrade everyone assigned to a single plan, buy licenses for the new plan (in this case Microsoft 365 Business Premium), and [assign those licenses individually](../admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md) to each user that you want to upgrade.

- **Some add-ons might prevent the upgrade** If you try to start an upgrade and you have an add-on that prevents you from continuing, you can remove the add-on first, and then add it back later if you still need it.

- **If you prepaid your plan** There isn't a straightforward upgrade path for prepaid plans. You'll know if you have a prepaid plan because you set up your plan using a product ID that you might have purchased in a store. Contact a partner, go to the Microsoft Store, or wait until your prepaid plan expires to switch to a new plan.

## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business Premium

1. Sign into the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.

2. Go to the navigation pane and select **Billing** \> **Your products**. Find your current subscription and select it to view the details.

3. On the next page, select **Upgrade**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you see a message that says **Upgrading your subscription is not supported with group-based licensing in Azure Active Directory**, you can safely ignore this unless you have a very large organization. Organizations who have selected this option will be aware that they're using group-based licensing.

4. Next, you can view a list of plans that you can upgrade to. In this case, find the Microsoft 365 Business Premium plan. You can scroll down if you want to see all the apps and services that are included with this plan. Under **Microsoft 365 Business Premium**, select **Upgrade** to add Microsoft 365 Business Premium to your cart.

5. In the cart:

    1. We'll automatically include licenses for all your current users. If you need more or fewer licenses, you need to [buy and assign those licenses individually](../admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).  
    2. You can adjust how you'd like to pay: monthly or yearly. Select the drop-down menu to make your choice.

6. Select **Go to Checkout** where you'll see a summary of your purchase, including the payment method for this account. You can also add a promo code here if you have one.

7. Select **Place order** to complete your purchase.\
It takes Microsoft a few minutes to set up your new service plans. To check on progress, select **Check upgrade status**.

8. When your plan is ready, you might need to complete some additional setup steps in the admin center. In the navigation pane, select **Home** to complete any additional setup steps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll receive a prorated refund for the Microsoft 365 licenses that you no longer need. Your bank account or credit card will be charged about two days after you set up the new plan.
  
## Protect user devices and files

Now that Microsoft 365 Business Premium licenses have been assigned, complete steps to start protecting devices and files. You'll use some new options included in the admin center navigation pane.
  
1. In the admin center, in the navigation pane, go to **Devices** \> **Policies**.

2. On the **Device policies** page, select **Add**.

3. In the **Add policy** pane give the policy a name (for example, Protect work files), and then choose a **Policy type** from the drop-down list.

    You can set up application policies for protecting files on Android and iPhone devices, as well as Windows 10, and you can set up device configuration policies for company owned Windows 10 devices. See the following links for details:

    - [Set app protection settings for Android or iOS devices](app-protection-settings-for-android-and-ios.md)

    - [Set application protection settings for Windows 10 devices](protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md)

    - [Set device protection settings for Windows 10 PCs](protection-settings-for-windows-10-pcs.md)

4. After you set up policies, you and your employees can set up devices:

    - If your Windows devices aren't already using the Windows Pro Creator update, you'll need to [upgrade them to Windows Pro Creators Update](upgrade-to-windows-pro-creators-update.md).

    - See [Set up Windows devices for Microsoft 365 Business Premium users](set-up-windows-devices.md) for steps for Windows devices.

    - See [Set up mobile devices for Microsoft 365 Business Premium users](set-up-mobile-devices.md) for steps for Android phones and iPhones.
