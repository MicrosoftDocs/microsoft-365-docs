# Manage protected devices with Microsoft 365 Business Premium

After a user connects their device to your organization by signing in with their work account to the device or to Office apps on the device, you can protect the device with the policies you set up. Connected devices are listed on the **Devices** page. If a device is lost or stolen, you can manage it from this page to remove any company data. You can also reset Windows 10 devices to their factory settings to wipe out any custom settings.
