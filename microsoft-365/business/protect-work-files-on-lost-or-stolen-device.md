# Protect work files when a mobile device is lost or stolen

The policy settings determine what happens automatically to protect a device that is lost or stolen. We recommend that you accept the default values during setup to create application policies for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 that apply to all users. You can create more policies after setup completes.
  
## Settings that protect work files

The following settings are available to protect work files if a user's device is lost or stolen:


|Setting  <br/> |Description  <br/> |
|:-----|:-----|
|Delete work files from an inactive device after this many days  <br/> |If a device isn't used for the number of days that you specify here, any work files stored on the device are automatically deleted.  <br/> |
|Force users to save all work files to OneDrive for Business  <br/> |If this setting is **On**, the only available save location for work files is OneDrive for Business.  <br/> |
|Encrypt work files  <br/> |Keep this setting **On** so that work files are protected by encryption. Even if the device is lost or stolen, no one can read your company data.  <br/> |
