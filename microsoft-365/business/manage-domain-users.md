# Synchronize domain users to Microsoft 365

## 1. Prepare for Directory Synchronization 

Before you synchronize your users and computers from the local Active Directory Domain, review [Prepare for directory synchronization to Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/prepare-for-directory-synchronization). In particular:

   - Make sure that no duplicates exist in your directory for the following attributes: **mail**, **proxyAddresses**, and **userPrincipalName**. These values must be unique and any duplicates must be removed.
   
   - We recommend that you configure the **userPrincipalName** (UPN) attribute for each local user account to match the primary email address that corresponds to the licensed Microsoft 365 user. For example: *mary.shelley@contoso.com* rather than *mary@contoso.local*
   
   - If the Active Directory domain ends in a non-routable suffix like *.local* or *.lan*, instead of an internet routable suffix such as *.com* or *.org*, adjust the UPN suffix of the local user accounts first as described in [Prepare a non-routable domain for directory synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/prepare-a-non-routable-domain-for-directory-synchronization). 

The **Run IdFix** in step four (4) below, will also make sure your on-premises Active Directory is ready for dir sync.

## 2. Install and configure Azure AD Connect

To synchronize your users, groups, and contacts from the local Active Directory into Azure Active Directory, install Azure Active Directory Connect and set up directory synchronization. 

 1. In the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a> select **Setup** in the left nav.

 2. Under **Sign-in and security**, choose **View**  under **Sync users from your org's directory**.

 3. On the **Sync users from your org's directory** page, choose **Get started**.

 4. In the first step  run IdFix tool to prepare for Directory sync.

 5. Follow the wizard steps to download Azure AD Connect and use it to synchronize your domain-controlled users to Microsoft 365.


See [Set up directory synchronization for Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/set-up-directory-synchronization) to learn more.

As you configure your options for Azure AD Connect, we recommend that you enable **Password Synchronization**, **Seamless Single Sign-On**, and the **password writeback** feature, which is also supported in Microsoft 365 for business.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some additional steps for password writeback beyond the check box in Azure AD Connect. For more information, see [How-to: configure password writeback](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-writeback). 

If you want to manage domain-joined Windows 10 devices also, see [Enable domain-joined Windows 10 devices to be managed by Microsoft 365 Business Premium](manage-windows-devices.md) to set up a hybrid Azure AD Join.
