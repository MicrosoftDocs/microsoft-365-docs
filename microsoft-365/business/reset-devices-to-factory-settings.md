# Reset Windows 10 devices to their factory settings

This article applies to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

A factory reset reverts a device to the original settings it had when the device was purchased. All apps and data on the device that were installed after purchase are removed. You can use Microsoft 365 for business to factory reset Windows 10 devices you manage.

2. In the left nav, choose **Devices** \> **Manage**.

3. On the **Manage** page, check the checkbox next to the device you want to remove data from and then, in the **Manage** drop-down choose **Factory reset**.
