### 1: Set up Microsoft 365 Business (Admin)

Sign in to [Microsoft 365 Business admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home) with your global admin credentials, and complete the steps below to set up Microsoft 365 Business. 
  
1. [Pre-requisites for protecting data on devices with Microsoft 365 Business](pre-requisites-for-data-protection.md)
    
    Read the pre-requisites first to make sure your devices are ready for Microsoft 365 Business.
    
2. [Set up Microsoft 365 Business by using the setup wizard](set-up.md)
    
    If you are **permanently moving from a local Active Directory to the cloud**, you can either add your users manually in the Microsoft 365 Business admin center by using the setup wizard, or you can do a one-time sync with Azure AD Connect. There are two ways to do this: 
    
  - If you also have an Exchange 2010, Exchange 2013, or Exchange 2016 server, you can [Use Minimal Hybrid to quickly migrate Exchange mailboxes to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/fdecceed-0702-4af3-85be-f2a0013937ef). The minimal hybrid steps include a one-time sync of users to Azure AD as well as email migration from on-premises to the cloud. After the email migration is complete, the directory synchronization is automatically turned off when using this method.
    
  - Use The Office 365 directory sync wizard to synchronize your users to the cloud. Follow the steps in [Set up directory synchronization for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/1b3b5318-6977-42ed-b5c7-96fa74b08846) to complete this process. After you synchronize your users to the cloud, you will have to [Turn off directory synchronization for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/ee5f861e-bd48-4267-83d1-a4ead4b4a00d).
    
    You will also have to give each user that was added this way a license to Microsoft 365 Business. You can do this in the [setup wizard](set-up.md), or in the [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/997596B5-4173-4627-B915-36ABAC6786DC).
    
### 2: Prepare mobile devices

Follow the steps in[Set up mobile devices for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-mobile-devices.md) to install Office apps on devices and making sure they are protected by Microsoft 365 Business. 
  
### 3: Prepare PCs

Admins can pre-select settings for new devices Windows 10 PCs by using [Windows AutoPilot](add-autopilot-devices-and-profile.md). Users can set up their existing or new Windows 10 devices by following the steps in this topic: [Set up Windows PCs for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-windows-devices.md). For existing devices users can also **Optionally**[move files to OneDrive for Business](move-files-to-onedrive.md). They can also use third-party tools to move files associated with Windows profile to OneDrive.
  
If your organization uses Windows Server Active Directory on-premises, you can set up Microsoft 365 Business to protect your Windows 10 devices, while still maintaining access to on-premises resources that require local authentication. Follow the steps in [Enable domain-joined Windows 10 devices to be managed by Microsoft 365 Business](manage-windows-devices.md) to set this up. This is the preferred method and devices in this state are called **Hybrid Azure AD joined devices**. 
  
If you retain a local Active Directory that contains some on-premises resources (such as file shares and printers) , you can give your **Azure AD-joined devices** access to these resources by following the steps here: [Access on-premises resources from an Azure AD-joined device in Microsoft 365 Business](access-resources.md).
  
After you have set up Windows 10 PCs, you can [automatically install Office](auto-install-or-uninstall-office.md) to the devices.
