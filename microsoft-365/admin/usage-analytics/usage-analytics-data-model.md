# Microsoft 365 usage analytics data model

## Data for the Microsoft 365 usage analytics tables

Microsoft 365 usage analytics connects to an API that exposes a multidimensional data model. The APIs that Microsoft 365 usage analytics uses to generate its data are from the various, generally available, Graph APIs. The function of the Microsoft 365 usage analytics API by itself isn't generally available.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Working with Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/resources/report). 
  
This API provides information about the monthly trend of usage of the various Microsoft 365 services. For the exact data returned by the API refer to the table in the following section.
