# Active user in Microsoft 365 usage reports

## Active user in usage reports

An active user of Microsoft 365 products for [Microsoft 365 usage analytics](usage-analytics.md) and the [Activity Reports in the admin center](../activity-reports/activity-reports.md) is defined as follows.

|Exchange Online  <br/> |Any user who has performed any of the following actions: Mark as read, send messages, create appointments, send meeting requests, accept (as tentative) or decline meeting requests, cancel meetings.  <br/> |No calendar information is represented, this will be added in an upcoming update.  <br/> |
|SharePoint Online  <br/> |Any user who has interacted with a file by creating, modifying, viewing, deleting, sharing internally or externally, or synchronizing to clients on any site or viewed a page on any site.  <br/> |The active user metrics for SharePoint Online in the Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics template app only reflect users who did file activity against a SharePoint Team site or a Group site.
