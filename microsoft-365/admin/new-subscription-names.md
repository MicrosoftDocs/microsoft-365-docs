# Office 365 is now Microsoft 365

We've changed some of our Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscription names. You don't need to do a thing. Your services, apps and features are staying the same, along with the price of your subscription. Your subscription name will automatically update in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2166757" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> and your billing statements will update on or after April 21, 2020.
