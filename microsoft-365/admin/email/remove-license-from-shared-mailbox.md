Shared mailboxes usually don't require a license. Follow these instructions to remove a license from a shared mailbox so that you can either assign it to a user or return the license so that you aren't paying for a license you don't need.

> [!NOTE]
> A license is required in the following scenarios:
> 1. The shared mailbox has more than 50 GB of storage in use.
> 2. The shared mailbox uses in-place archiving.
> 3. The shared mailbox is placed in litigation hold.
> 4. The shared mailbox has a Microsoft Defender license assigned.
