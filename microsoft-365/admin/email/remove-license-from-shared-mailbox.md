# Remove a license from a shared mailbox

Shared mailboxes usually don't require a license. Follow these instructions to remove a license from a shared mailbox so that you can either assign it to a user or return the license so that you aren't paying for a license you don't need.

> [!NOTE]
>
> An Exchange Online Plan 2 license is required in the following scenarios:
>
> - The shared mailbox has more than 50 GB of storage in use.
> - The shared mailbox uses in-place archiving.
> - The shared mailbox is placed in litigation hold.
> - The shared mailbox has a Microsoft 365 Defender license assigned.
> 
> For step-by-step instructions on how to assign licenses, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
