When you change your domain's email to come to Microsoft 365, by updating your domain's MX record during setup, ALL email sent to that domain will start coming to Microsoft 365. Make sure you've added users and created mailboxes in Microsoft 365 for everyone who has email on your domain BEFORE you change the MX record. Don't want to move email for everyone on your domain to Microsoft 365? You can take steps to [pilot Microsoft 365 with just a few email addresses instead](../misc/pilot-microsoft-365-from-my-custom-domain.md?view=o365-worldwide).
