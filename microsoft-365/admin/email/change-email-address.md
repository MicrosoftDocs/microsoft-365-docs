# Change your Microsoft 365 email address to use your custom domain

Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for.

Your initial email address in Microsoft 365 includes .onmicrosoft.com, like tom@fourthcoffee.onmicrosoft.com. You can change it to a friendlier address like tom@fourthcoffee.com. You'll need your own domain name, like fourthcoffee.com first. If you already have one, great! If not, you can learn how to [buy one from a domain registrar](../get-help-with-domains/buy-a-domain-name.md).

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

Your initial email address in Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet includes partner.onmschina.cn, like tom@fourthcoffee.partner.onmschina.cn. You can change it to a friendlier address like tom@fourthcoffee.cn. You'll need your own domain name, like fourthcoffee.cn first. If you already have one, great! If not, you can learn how to [buy one from a domain registrar](../get-help-with-domains/buy-a-domain-name.md).

When you change your domain's email to come to Microsoft 365, by updating your domain's MX record during setup, ALL email sent to that domain will start coming to Microsoft 365. Make sure you've added users and created mailboxes in Microsoft 365 for everyone who has email on your domain BEFORE you change the MX record. Don't want to move email for everyone on your domain to Microsoft 365? You can take steps to [pilot Microsoft 365 with just a few email addresses instead](../misc/pilot-microsoft-365-from-my-custom-domain.md).
