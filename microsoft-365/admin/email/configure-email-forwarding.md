# Configure email forwarding in Microsoft 365

As the admin of an organization, you might have company requirements to set up email forwarding for a user's mailbox. Email forwarding lets you forward email messages sent to a user's mailbox to another user's mailbox inside or outside of your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use outbound spam filter policies to control automatic forwarding to external recipients. For more information, see [Control automatic external email forwarding in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/outbound-spam-policies-external-email-forwarding#how-the-outbound-spam-filter-policy-settings-work-with-other-automatic-email-forwarding-controls).
> 
> Email forwarding to recipients outside the organization doesn't prevent messages identified as spam, phishing, or malware from being forwarded. The recipient needs their own email security filter to identify and block these messages.

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

Before you set up email forwarding, note the following:

- Allow automatically forwarded messages to be sent to people on the remote domain. See [Manage remote domains](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/remote-domains/manage-remote-domains) for details.

- Once you set up email forwarding, only **new** emails sent to the  **from**  mailbox will be forwarded.

- Email forwarding requires that the *from* account has a license unless it's a shared mailbox. If you're setting up email forwarding because the user has left your organization, another option is to [convert their mailbox to a shared mailbox](convert-user-mailbox-to-shared-mailbox.md). This way several people can access it. However, a shared mailbox can't exceed 50 GB.

- You must be an Exchange administrator or Global administrator in Microsoft 365 to do these steps. For more information, see the article [About admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
