# Configure Microsoft 365 shared mailbox settings

After you have [created a shared mailbox](create-a-shared-mailbox.md), you'll want to configure some settings for the mailbox users, such as email forwarding and automatic replies. Later, you might want to change other settings, such as the mailbox name, members, or member permissions.

## Change the name of a shared mailbox

1. In the admin center, go to **Teams & groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>.

2. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, and then select **Edit** under **Basic information**.

3. Enter a new name for the shared mailbox.

4. Select **Save**.

## Change the email address of a shared mailbox

1. In the admin center, go to **Teams & groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>.

2. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, and then select **Edit** under **Email addresses**.

3. Enter a new email address for the shared mailbox. If you want to change the primary email address, your mailbox must have more than one email alias.

## Forward emails that are sent to a shared mailbox

You do not need to assign a license to the shared mailbox in order to forward email that's sent to it. You can forward the messages to any valid email address or distribution list.

1. In the admin center, go to **Teams & groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>.

2. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, then select **Edit** under **Email forwarding**.

3. Select the checkbox to **Forward all emails sent to this mailbox**. Enter one email address to forward the messages to. It can be any valid email address. To forward to multiple addresses, you need to [create a distribution group](/office365/admin/setup/create-distribution-lists) for the addresses, and then enter the name of the group in this box.

4. Select **Save**.

## Send automatic replies from a shared mailbox

1. In the admin center, go to **Teams & groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>.

2. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, then select **Edit** under **Automatic replies**.

3. Select the checkbox to **Send automatic replies to senders inside this organization**.

4. Enter the replies you want to send to people inside or outside your organization. You can't add images, only text.

5. Select **Save**.

## Allow everyone to see the Sent email (the replies)

By default, messages sent from the shared mailbox aren't saved to the Sent Items folder of the shared mailbox. Instead, they are saved to the Sent Items folder of the person who sent the message.

If you want to allow everyone to see the Sent email, in the admin center, edit the shared mailbox settings. Select **Edit** under **Sent items**. Select the options you want for sent items.

## Choose the apps that a shared mailbox can use to access Microsoft email

1. In the admin center, go to **Teams & groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>.

2. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, then select **Edit** under **Email apps**.

3. Select the checkboxes for all of the apps you want members to be able to use to access the shared mailbox.

4. Select **Save**.
