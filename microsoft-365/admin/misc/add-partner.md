::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

A Microsoft authorized partner can act as your subscription advisor and provide the sales, support, and technical expertise that you need to help you set up and maintain your Microsoft 365 business subscription. You can add a subscription advisor partner as a partner of record when you buy Microsoft 365 or at another time. If you're not currently working with a partner, you can also find one on the [Microsoft Pinpoint](https://pinpoint.microsoft.com) website.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../../commerce/manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, a Billing profile owner or contributor, or an Invoice manager to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../../commerce/manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Understand your Microsoft business billing profile](../../commerce/billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be a Global or Billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner or Global admin.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

The partner that you choose depends on the Microsoft products and services that you use and the country/region where you use them. If you're adding a partner, or changing the partner for your subscription, you must first get the partner's Microsoft Partner ID by asking the partner for it.

As an admin for Office 365, you can create or edit users, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, manage domains, and assign admin permissions to other users in your organization, among other things. However, if you want someone else to do these administrative tasks, you can delegate this role to an authorized partner of 21Vianet by creating a partner relationship.
