# Using self-service sign-up in your organization

Self-service sign-up makes it easier for users in your organization to sign up for online services from Microsoft. We call this sign up process "self-service sign-up" because your users can sign up to use services paid by your subscription, or use free services, without asking you to take action on their behalf.

## How self-service sign-up works

The following example describes how self-sign up works for a school. The same process works for any organization that has self-service programs enabled in their tenant.

1. Students and faculty members have school email addresses that indicate they're associated with your institution. For example, the email address jakob@uw.edu may indicate a student at the University of Washington.
2. Students and faculty go to [our web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=536628), and use their email address to sign up for the services that your organization offers, such Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. They can also sign up for other free services that we offer.
3. We validate their email address, and then they can start using Microsoft 365, Power BI, or other services right away.
1. As the business admin, you can see who signs up for a subscription by selecting the subscription on the **Licensing** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This way you can see when there are new or unrecognized licenses for services in your tenant. To control whether users can sign up for self-service subscriptions, use the [Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.signins/update-mgpolicyauthorizationpolicy?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true) PowerShell cmdlet with the **AllowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions** parameter. For more information, see [How do I control self-service settings?](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup#how-do-i-control-self-service-settings)
