# Microsoft 365 Experience insights dashboard

The Experience insights (preview) dashboard shows you data across usage and sentiment to give you a fuller view of your organization's experience with Microsoft 365.
Experience insights is optimized for organizations with 2000 plus seats. We are working on bringing the experience to smaller organizations in the future. This information and data on the dashboard will help you better understand and improve your users' experience with Microsoft 365. The dashboard shows you data across usage and user sentiment and helps give you a fuller picture of your users' overall experience. You can drill down into specific information such as feature usage for certain apps, exact feedback and Net Promoter Score (NPS) comments, and top help articles viewed by users in your organization. This info can help you identify opportunities to improve users’ Microsoft 365 products and app experiences in your organization.

## Suggested training

**Suggested training** gives you deeper insights into the Microsoft 365 help and training articles being read by your signed-in users on support.microsoft.com and in-app help panels with these 3 insights:

- **Top viewed articles** for your organization shows you help and training articles that have been getting the most views by people in your organization.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/suggested-training-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Suggested training data dashboard":::

Use this data to decide which help articles and training resources to share with your users about these products and apps, or make sure your helpdesk is aware of these areas so they can answer any user questions. If your org doesn’t have enough views on help and training articles, you’ll see data from other Microsoft 365 organizations.

## Apps and services data

The **Apps and services** data section shows you a unified view across usage and sentiment in your organization to give you an at-a-glance understanding of your users' experience with Microsoft 365. Select an app or service to get additional details, such as comments submitted through feedback and NPS surveys, or the top Microsoft 365 help articles your users viewed. You can also favorite the apps or services in the list so that you can more easily view them.

### Apps and services chart information

The chart information gives you insight into the apps and services that you want to track data on. Select an app or service to dig deeper into usage, product feedback, net promoter score and help content data.

Similar to product feedback, you can also view the specific comments your users submitted. In some cases where there is enough volume, you may also see Top topics that categorizes some of the comments into bucketed categories for easier parsing of the data.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/experience-insights-teams-nps2.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Image showing Teams NPS insights":::

### Teams help article example

For the first time, you can now see what articles your users are consuming on Support.Microsoft.com com or via the Microsoft 365 in-app help experiences. You can see the top articles for the specific app or service in your organization, how many people are viewing the app, and preview the article in-line. This can be an excellent way of identifying what your users are trying to do and where they may be struggling. Since not all users seek out help, it’s a good indication of content that may be beneficial to a broader set of users in the organization. [Learn more](experience-insights-help-articles.md)
