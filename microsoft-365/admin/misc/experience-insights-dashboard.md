### Teams help article example

For the first time, you can now see what articles your users are consuming on Support.Microsoft.com com or via the Microsoft 365 in-app help experiences. You can see the top articles for the specific app or service in your organization, how many people are viewing the app, and preview the article in-line. This can be an excellent way of identifying what your users are trying to do and where they may be struggling.
