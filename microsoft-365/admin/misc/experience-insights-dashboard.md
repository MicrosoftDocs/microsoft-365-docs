# Microsoft 365 Experience insights dashboard

The Experience insights (preview) dashboard shows you data across usage and sentiment to give you a fuller view of your organization's experience with Microsoft 365.
Experience insights is optimized for organizations with 2000 plus seats. We are working on bringing the experience to smaller organizations in the future. This information and data on the dashboard will help you better understand and improve your users' experience with Microsoft 365. The dashboard shows you data across usage and user sentiment and helps give you a fuller picture of your users' overall experience. You can drill down into specific information such as feature usage for certain apps, exact feedback and Net Promoter Score (NPS) comments, and top help articles viewed by users in your organization. This info can help you identify opportunities to improve users’ Microsoft 365 products and app experiences in your organization.

Use this data to decide which help articles and training resources to share with your users about these products and apps, or make sure your helpdesk is aware of these areas so they can answer any user questions. If your org doesn’t have enough views on help and training articles, you’ll see data from other Microsoft 365 organizations.

For the first time, you can now see what articles your users are consuming on Support.Microsoft.com com or via the Microsoft 365 in-app help experiences. You can see the top articles for the specific app or service in your organization, how many people are viewing the app, and preview the article in-line.
