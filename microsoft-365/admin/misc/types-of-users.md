# Quick help: Types of users

On the **Active users** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can filter by the following types of users. 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Type of user** <br/> |**Definition** <br/> |
|Licensed users  <br/> |These users have been assigned a Microsoft 365 license, such as Microsoft 365 Business Standard or Office 365 Enterprise E3, so they can use Microsoft 365 services.  <br/> |
|Sign-in allowed  <br/> |These users can sign into Microsoft 365 to create documents, check email, and so forth. Most of your users should be able to sign in at any given time.  <br/> |
|Sign-in blocked  <br/> |These users cannot sign into Microsoft 365. An example of this is a user who left the company and you blocked their access to Microsoft 365.  <br/> |
|Unlicensed users  <br/> |These users have no Microsoft 365 license, like Microsoft 365 Business Standard or Office 365 Enterprise E3, so they can't use Microsoft 365 features. Examples are administrators who only need to manage Microsoft 365, employees who have left the company, or shared and resource mailboxes that aren't associated with people.  <br/> |
|Users with errors  <br/> |These users have errors associated with their account that need to be resolved.  <br/> |
|Billing admins  <br/> |These users can make purchases, manage subscriptions, manage support tickets, and monitor service health on your behalf.  <br/> |
|Global admins  <br/> |These users have access to all administrative features. The person who signs up for Microsoft 365 becomes a global admin but you can have more than one if you like. Global admins are the only admins who can assign admin roles to others.  <br/> |
|Password admins  <br/> |These users can reset passwords, manage service requests, and monitor service health on your behalf.  <br/> |
|Service admins  <br/> |These users can manage service requests and monitor service health on your behalf.  <br/> |
|User management admins  <br/> |These users can reset passwords, monitor service health, manage user accounts, user groups, and service requests. They can't delete a global admin, create other admin roles, or reset passwords for billing, global, and service admins.  <br/> |
|Add custom filter  <br/> |With this option, you can create a custom filter to view only certain types of users of your preference, such as which users are on the Microsoft 365 Apps for business plan. [Quick help: Filter users](../add-users/create-edit-or-delete-a-custom-user-view.md).  <br/> |
