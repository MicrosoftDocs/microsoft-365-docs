# Turn the profile video feature on or off for all users in your Microsoft 365 organization

As the Microsoft 365 administrator, you can turn the profile video feature on or off for users in your organization. Profile videos are 30-second videos that appear on profile cards in Microsoft 365 apps such as Outlook.

## Use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to turn profile videos on or off

By default, profile video creation is turned on in Microsoft 365 organizations.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.

2. In the left nav, go to **Settings** -> **Org Settings**.

3. On the **Services** tab, select **Profile video**.

4. Select or deselect the **Allow your organization to use profile video**.

## Use the Microsoft Graph API to turn profile videos on or off

The requests below are done with the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/graph-explorer/graph-explorer-overview).

1. Make a GET request to the following endpoint to get the Organization ID: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization.

2. Retrieve “id” field from the response payload. This is your organization ID, referred to as **my-org-id**.

3. Make a GET request to the following endpoint to get the current state of profile video admin setting: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/my-org-id/settings/profileVideo The response should look like this:

```http
{ "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#organization('**my-org-id**')/settings/profileVideo/$entity",

"isEnabledInOrganization": false

}
```

The **isEnabledInOrganization** field will be set to either true or false. True means profile video capabilities are on and false means users can't make profile videos.

4. Make a PATCH request to the following endpoint to update state of profile video admin setting, https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/my-org-id/settings/profileVideo, with the following request body:

```http

{

"isEnabledInOrganization": true

}
```

In the request body, populate the value for **isEnabledInOrganization** to either true or false, depending on whether you’d like to turn profile videos on or off.

5. Send the request. If it's successful, you should receive a 200 HTTP response code, and the response payload should confirm that your feature has been turned on or off. To validate, you can rerun the steps in the section “Get current state profile video admin toggle” to get the updated value.
