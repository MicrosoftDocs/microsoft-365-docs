# Exchange Online recommendations

Exchange Online is a messaging solution that delivers email, calendar, contacts, and tasks from PCs, the web, and mobile devices.

Use Exchange Online to set up multiple professional business email addresses, including shared addresses. Migrate emails from your old service and set up mail flow rules, block domains, set up informative notes, and troubleshoot email delivery problems. With Exchange Online Protection, protect from spam, phishing, and malware.

Exchange Online gives you **professional business email capability** by providing you with a 50\~100 GB storage capacity mailbox and anywhere access to your emails.

With Exchange Online, you can **create multiple email addresses** associated with your primary mailbox so you can easily manage your emails and keep your inbox organized.

Exchange Online provides the ability to **create additional mailboxes** at no added cost.
