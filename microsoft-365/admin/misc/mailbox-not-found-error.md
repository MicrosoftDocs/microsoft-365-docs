# Getting a mailbox not found error in Outlook on the web?

If you're using Outlook on the web and you get a  **Mailbox couldn't be found for**  error, the account that you used to connect to Outlook on the web doesn't have an Exchange Online license and therefore, no mailbox is associated with the account. 

## Assign a license to your account

Your admin can assign a license to your account by following these steps:

1. Open the  [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/homepage)  and go to  **Active users**  under the  **Users**  section, and select the user who is seeing the error.
1. In the user page that opens, go to the  **Licenses and Apps**  section, select the appropriate  **Location**  value, and assign a license that contains Exchange Online (expand the license to see its details). 
1. When you're finished, click  **Save changes**.
