## Transitioning to a remote workforce

In light of the COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) outbreak, many business owners are finding themselves with a completely remote work staff. Here's what you can do to make a transition to remote work safe, secure, and productive.

## Connect with employees and customers

You can still connect with employees, customers, clients, and partners, even if you canâ€™t meet face to face. Use Microsoft Teams to continue doing business and connecting with your customers.

### Meet up in Teams

Host audio, video, and web meetings with employees, customers, or partners through Microsoft Teams.

### Collaborate with customers

Invite employees and customers to a team so you can work directly with them to coordinate and collaborate all in one place.
