## Transitioning to a remote workforce

In light of the COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) outbreak, many business owners are finding themselves with a completely remote work staff. Here's what you can do to make a transition to remote work safe, secure, and productive.

## Connect with employees and customers

You can still connect with employees, customers, clients, and partners, even if you can’t meet face to face. Use Microsoft Teams to continue doing business and connecting with your customers.

### Meet up in Teams

Host audio, video, and web meetings with employees, customers, or partners through Microsoft Teams.

For more information, see [Host online meetings](../../business-video/start-and-pin-chats.md) and [Chat with employees and customers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/chat-with-employees-and-customers-65748808-a403-462c-a6e1-b169e5bc6c92).

### Store and share files

Put your business documents in the cloud and share them securely, both internally and externally.

### Collaborate with customers

Invite employees and customers to a team so you can work directly with them to coordinate and collaborate all in one place.

For more information, see [Create a team](../../business-video/team-with-guests.md) and [Enable guest access](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access).

## Manage and secure your business to run remotely

Just a few steps can help you keep your business secure, even with remote employees and guest users.

### Secure your users

Use multi-factor authentication to protect your data and devices.

For more information, see [Turn on multi-factor authentication](../../business-video/turn-on-mfa.md).

### Secure your devices

Remotely manage PCs and phones and ensure that they are protected and up-to-date. Requires Microsoft 365 Business.
