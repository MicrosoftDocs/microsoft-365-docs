# Cortana in Microsoft 365

Cortana, your personal productivity assistant, offers AI-powered experiences to save time and focus attention on what matters most. Cortana is designed to deliver features that safely and securely process and reason over Office 365 data like emails, files, chats, etc., to save time, increase efficiency, and enhance your users’ productivity.

When signed in with valid work or school accounts, users can get cloud-based assistance services with Cortana in Microsoft 365 experiences that meet Office 365’s enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises (“**Cortana enterprise services**”).

- **Cortana enterprise services include** Cortana in Windows 10 (version 2004 and later), Outlook for iOS and Android, Microsoft Teams mobile apps for iOS and Android and [Microsoft Teams displays](/microsoftteams/devices/teams-displays).

- These different experiences are subject to separate licensing terms and have separate opt-out steps described below.

- Consistent with other Office 365 services, Cortana enterprise services meet the same enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises as reflected in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products).

- New Microsoft 365 experiences, such as the Briefing email and Play My Emails, will be enabled using Cortana enterprise services and fully comply with those promises. These features are currently available worldwide (standard multi-tenant).

### Conversational AI in Outlook for iOS with Cortana

In Outlook for iOS, Cortana’s voice-driven conversational AI experience enables users to ask their productivity assistant to schedule meetings, compose emails, manage their calendar and inbox, and find all kinds of information.

Using natural language, speech recognition, machine learning, and linguistics based on Microsoft AI technology, Cortana gets to know your context to help you stay organized, connected to the people and things that are important to you, and in control of your day.

Simply use the microphone button to ask Cortana to add meeting recipients, or change dates, times, or locations. You can also ask Cortana to find specific events. Lastly, you can ask Cortana to compose quick emails, forward messages, or reply to threads. Cortana’s mic can also help you start Play My Emails in Outlook for iOS, so you can listen to your inbox hands-free.

Initially, this new conversational AI capability with Cortana will be available in English for customers in the United States using Outlook for iOS with a Microsoft 365 work account. To learn more, go to [Start a conversation with your personal productivity assistant in Outlook with Cortana](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/start-a-conversation-with-your-personal-productivity-assistant/ba-p/2071416#:~:text=Conversational%20AI%20allows%20you%20to,time%2C%20all%20with%20your%20voice).

### Conversational AI with Cortana in Outlook with iOS is an opt-in experience

Individual users will be prompted to opt in to the conversational AI experience the first time they select the “Use Voice” mic button in Outlook on iOS.

### Play My Emails

Play My Emails (as connected to through Outlook mobile) is a voice-driven, hands-free experience for users to listen to new messages in their Focused Inbox and changes to their day via the speakers on their phone, headphones, or connected audio device. Users can ask Cortana to read their recent emails aloud, and ask Cortana to take actions such as flag, archive, delete, and skip messages. This feature is especially helpful to catch up on your email while commuting, multitasking, or on the go. When the user talks to Cortana in Play My Emails, the speech audio request goes directly to Cortana enterprise services. A text to speech readout of the user's email is processed inside the Office 365 cloud. During this process, no Office 365 data is processed on the user's mobile device and no email data is saved. A transcript of spoken commands (i.e. "mark as read," "next," "flag," etc.) may be retained in accordance with the Data Protection Terms in the Microsoft [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products).

Cortana will call out when an email is protected and briefly pause before reading the message to give users enough time to pause playback or skip to the next message. Similar to a private phone call, users should exercise caution when initiating playback in locations where confidential information could potentially be overheard. In these instances, it's recommended that employees of your organization wear headphones in appropriate environments when using Play My Emails in Outlook mobile.

### How to opt out of Play My Emails

Individuals can opt out of Play My Emails using the following steps.

1. Open Outlook mobile.

2. Go to **Settings**.

3. Select **Play My Emails**.

4. Move the toggle to off on the accounts you want to disable.

[Learn more about Play My Emails](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4558256)

### Briefing email

Cortana sends a personalized briefing email with tasks and commitments you made with a convenient way to mark them as **done** or schedule focus time to get them done. It also includes a summary of your meetings and relevant documents for your day. Cortana extracts information from a user’s email messages and stores it in their Exchange Online mailbox until it’s consolidated into the Briefing email. At no time is personal data accessible outside of your Exchange Online mailbox. Users get access to the Briefing email only if they have licenses that include the Exchange Online service plan.

### How to opt out of Briefing email

Admins can configure Briefing for their organization using [PowerShell](/briefing/be-admin) in Exchange Online. Individuals can opt out of Cortana's Briefing email by selecting **Unsubscribe** in the footer of the message.

## How is the delivery of Cortana enterprise services different from the delivery of other Cortana features I may have previously experienced?

Here are the two ways to think of how Cortana works in your enterprise:

**New experiences for organizations with Cortana enterprise services**: Cortana enterprise services are designed to meet the security and compliance needs of organizations:

1. This is a new service and is discussed here in this document.

2. For services subject to the Online Services Terms, Microsoft is a data processor: Microsoft collects and uses Customer Data from customers only to provide the online services requested by our customers and for the purposes instructed by our customers. Under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the customer is the data controller of their data. See the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Introducing more privacy transparency for our commercial cloud customers](https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2019/11/18/introducing-privacy-transparency-commercial-cloud-customers/).

3. As an example, Play My Emails is a Cortana service that your users can connect to through Outlook for iOS and utilizes Cortana enterprise services.

4. IT admins will always have controls for optional connected experiences for Cortana, similar to optional connected experiences while using Office ProPlus applications.

**Existing services for consumers**: Cortana optional connected services are designed primarily for consumer experiences and are currently delivered in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android.

1. These experiences enable features such as weather, news, and traffic.

2. Tenant admins can control whether Cortana in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android are able to allow Cortana to connect to Office 365 tenant data.

Turn off Cortana access to your organization's Microsoft hosted data

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, select **Settings** > **Org Settings** and select **Cortana**.

2. Unselect the checkbox for **Allow Cortana in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier), and the Cortana app on iOS and Android, to access Microsoft-hosted data on behalf of people in your organization** to disable Cortana connected experiences.

3. Select **Save changes**.

For services governed by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2109174) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement), Microsoft is the data controller. As the data controller, Microsoft uses data to improve products and services in accordance with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
