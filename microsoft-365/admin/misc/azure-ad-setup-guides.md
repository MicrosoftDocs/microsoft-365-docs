# Azure Active Directory setup guides

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) features help you manage and secure your organization. These setup guides will help you integrate those features in a simple way. In the following sections, we’ll give a brief description of the setup guides and share links to the guides.

## Who are these setup guides for?

These setup guides are designed for small to medium-sized organizations that typically might not have a dedicated identity team. You don’t need to be an identity expert to use them.

## What to expect and what you’ll need

The setup guides help you configure the core functionality of Azure AD. If you need to set up a more advanced configuration, the setup guide will point you to the appropriate location in the Azure AD portal.

### Required permissions

You must be a member of the following administrator roles:

- Global administrator: allows you to use integrated tools in the setup guides to make changes in your Microsoft 365 organization.

- Global reader: allows you to view the setup guides but not make changes in your tenant.

## Azure Active Directory deployment  

The Azure Active Directory setup guide will help you set up the most common Azure AD features in a recommended order. The setup guide is split into three sections: **Initial**, **Core**, and **Advanced**. Each section recommends a set of features you should turn on.

The setup guides contain a checklist of the tasks you need to complete and you can track your progress as you go through the guides. The guides will also link to the other setup guides when necessary.

## Add or sync users to your Microsoft account  

This guide helps you get your user accounts setup in Azure and Microsoft 365. Based on your environment and needs, you can choose to add users individually, migrate your on-premises directory with Azure AD cloud sync or Azure AD Connect, or troubleshoot existing sync issues.
