# Microsoft 365 admin mobile app recommendations

The Microsoft 365 mobile admin center is a mobile application that a Microsoft 365 admin can use to manage Microsoft 365 on the go.

This mobile app works just like the familiar web-based admin center. Key tasks, such as resetting passwords, adding and removing users, and modifying licenses can be handled while away from a computer.

The Microsoft 365 admin mobile app can be installed from the [Apple App store (iOS phone)](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id761397963?pt=80423&ct=docsaboutadminapp&mt=8) or [Google Play store (Android phone)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ms.office365admin&referrer=utm_source%3Ddocsaboutadminapp%26utm_campaign%25docsaboutadminapp).

You can also download the app from Microsoft 365 Admin app link in the upper right in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).

If you are an admin and responsible for more than one Microsoft 365 organization, sign in to multiple organizations and quickly switch between them. The app supports dark theme and is available in 39 languages.

## How does the Microsoft 365 admin mobile app work?

The admin app has many capabilities that enable an admin to manage Microsoft 365 from their mobile or tablet device when they can’t get to a computer. Here’s a list of a few of the tasks you can do from the app:

- **Manage users and devices:** Add or edit a user, reset a user’s password, assign a role, block user, delete user, manage alias, assign licenses, wipe device data and more.

- **Manage groups:** Add a group, add or remove users from groups.

- **License management and billing:** View a list of purchased and assigned licenses, assign licenses to users, purchase or remove licenses and view and download invoices.

- **Support:** Create a new service request and keep track of all the updates related to the service requests while you are on the go.

- **Message Center:** Stay on top of all the upcoming changes, planned maintenance, or other important announcements related to Microsoft 365

- **Service Health:** Monitor the health of all the services by viewing the current status of the service and details about service disruption and outages.

- **Notifications:** Stay on top of all the important information and updates related to message center posts, service health and billing through push notifications. You can even customize what you want to be notified of.
