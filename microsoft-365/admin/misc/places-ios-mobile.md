These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.  INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO APPLE INC. ("APPLE") FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT IF APPLICABLE.

If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. You further agree that your use of the software may be subject to: i. your organization’s guidelines and policies regarding the use of the software; and ii. the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization, and in such case these terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work email address to access the software, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account to continue accessing the software

D. **Product Keys**. The software requires a key to install or access it. You are responsible for the use of any product key(s) assigned to you and must not share the key(s) with third parties. You may use as many copies of the software as the product key permits

F. **Third Party Components.** The software may include third party applications and components that are licensed to you under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party applications may be accessible online at [Third-Party Notices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/third-party-notices) or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law

## PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE

The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version

## FEEDBACK ABOUT THE SOFTWARE

If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement

## DATA

A. Data Collection.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at [https://aka.ms/privacy](https://aka.ms/privacy). Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices

B. **Processing of Personal Data**. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at [Microsoft’s GDPR Commitments](/legal/gdpr).

## MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 COMMERCIAL SUBSCRIPTION

Use of the software requires a Microsoft Office 365 commercial subscription. Your access to the software made available on account of your Microsoft Office 365 commercial subscription must comply with the existing terms for Microsoft Office 365 that apply to you through your subscription or your organization's subscription. You may lose access to the service if a. your or your organization’s Microsoft Office 365 subscription expires, or b. your organization decides to terminate your license to access the service

## EXPORT RESTRICTIONS

You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit <https://aka.ms/exporting>

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE

You represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties

## SUPPORT SERVICES

Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the software

## UPDATES

The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices

## BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

**This Section applies if you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States**. If you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft **agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury**. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. **Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.** The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at [https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4](https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4). You and Microsoft agree to these terms.

## TERMINATION

Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component parts

## ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software

## APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES

If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration)

## THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY

You agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this agreement, and Apple has the right to enforce this agreement.**

## PRODUCT CLAIMS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Microsoft, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the software or your possession and/or use of the software. In the event of any third party claim that the software or your possession and use of that software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Microsoft, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim

## CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS

This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you

A. **Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights

B. **Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software

C. **Germany and Austria**

i. **Warranty**. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

ii. **Limitation of Liability**. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence

## DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

**THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. IF DESIRED, YOU MAY NOTIFY APPLE FOR A REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE WILL HAVE NO OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS THAT THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT**.

## LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES

**IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM APPLE, MICROSOFT, AND MICROSOFT’S SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES**.

**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft or Apple knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.**

## CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

The software, including its user interface, features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers

Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard**.

**EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas**.
