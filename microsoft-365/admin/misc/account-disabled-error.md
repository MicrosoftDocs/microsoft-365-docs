# Getting an account disabled error in Outlook on the web

If you get the error **Your account has been disabled** with `X-OWA-Error: Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Storage.AccountDisabledException` when you try to open Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App), your admin might have disabled your access to Outlook on the web.

Your admin can fix this error by following the steps in the topic [Enable or disable Outlook Web App for a mailbox](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/enable-or-disable-outlook-web-app).
