# Microsoft Feedback Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all users providing feedback to Microsoft.

## Member Qualifications

Microsoft Feedback is designed for individuals who have reached the age of consent.

By providing feedback to Microsoft, you agree that you uphold this Code of Conduct. You're responsible for all activities and content you post and upload.

In addition to upholding this Code of Conduct, you're also responsible for adhering to all applicable local and national laws. This is your community. Help us to keep it safe, friendly, fun, and helpful.

## Do

- Be polite and respectful in your posts, and in your replies to other people.
- Keep conversation threads on track and constructive. It's okay to disagree with another user's post, but don't take the thread off track to do so. Always address your comments to the person who asked the initial question, not the other posters.
- Cite the source of anything you post or upload if it isn't your own original content. Be honest about your sources.
- Keep it clean. No profanity, obscenity, insulting or bigoted comments or feedback please.
- If providing feedback in community experiences, search to see if the feedback you’d like to give is already posted.  You can then comment on that feedback or vote on it.
- Report any kind of abuse you find in the community. You find "Report abuse" links in every post and in every profile.

## Don't

- Post feedback that is the same or similar to feedback you posted before.
- Threaten, stalk, insult, victimize or intimidate anyone (or group of people) for any reason, including on the basis of age, gender, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, race, or religion.
- Incite other users to threaten, stalk, insult, victimize, or intimidate another person or group of people.
- Harass, insult, tease, or correct other users about the grammar used in their posts. Good or bad grammar isn't the point-the feedback community is about sharing feedback with Microsoft and others within the community.
- Post content that is showing nudity of any sort, including full or partial photographic human nudity, or nudity in cartoons, fantasy art, or manga.
- Post chain letters.
- Link to websites that require payment to access information.
- Post links to external sites that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Things that will get you immediately banned from participating in feedback

- Posting content that is intended to harm or exploit minors in any way, including collecting the personal data of any minor (anyone under18 years old), including, but not limited to: name, email address, home address, phone number, or the name of the minor's school.
- Invading anyone's privacy by attempting to harvest, collect, store, or publish private or personal data, such as passwords, account information, credit card numbers, addresses, or other contact information without that person's knowledge and willing consent.
- Posting content or links to content that is illegal or violates any applicable local or national laws.
- Posting or spreading viruses, worms, malware, or other software intended to harm another user's computer.
- Impersonating a Microsoft employee, agent, manager, host, administrator, moderator, another user, MVP, or any other person through any means.
- Pirating Microsoft software or products, or offering pirated software or products for sale, including posting product keys.
- Specifically violating Microsoft licensing or terms, such as posting content or links that install a third party kernel, or evade security measures built into the software.
- Promoting or otherwise facilitating the purchase and sale of ammunition or firearms.
- Posting 'spam,' 'pyramid schemes,' 'affiliate marketing,' or unsolicited commercial advertisements of any kind, including advertising for money-making schemes, discount cards, credit counseling, online surveys, or online contests.
- Attempting to manipulate the forums, or other community features, including ranking and reputation systems, by violating any of the provisions of this Code of Conduct, colluding with others on voting, or using multiple profiles.
- Offering to make international money transfers for amounts exceeding the asking price of an item, with intent to request a refund of any portion of the payment.
- Using any form of automated device or computer program that enables the submission of postings without the express written consent of Microsoft Corporation.

## Community User Cautions

- Be cautious about accepting direct help from another user. If that user suggests they can use Remote Assistance to help you, be aware that that user has access to your computer, and that your computer could be hacked.
- If you volunteer to help another user through Remote Access, be careful not to harm their computer in any way, or to access information that isn't openly made available to you. Abuse of Remote Access won't be tolerated and results in you being banned from the community.
- Be careful with your personal information. If you provide your email address in a post when providing feedback publicly, the general public may use it for any purpose.
- Don't post information that others can use to steal your identity, like your street address, your phone number, your social security number, or your credit card number.

## Termination and Cancellation

Microsoft reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so, to review and remove user-created services and content at will and without notice and delete content and accounts. Microsoft reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to permanently ban participants or terminate access to the feedback community. Microsoft further reserves the right to decommission its feedback experiences at any time in the future.

## Rights and Responsibilities

- You might use the Report Abuse links in the public feedback communities to report violations of this Code of Conduct.

You assume all risk for your use.
- You understand that posting content or submitting material is voluntary, and you are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any submissions or contributions. You're solely responsible for your dealings with any third party that relates to your use of the community, or any information or materials you obtain from a third party.
- No Compensation. Microsoft shall not be obligated to provide, and you have no expectation of receiving, any compensation in any form for your voluntary participation in the community, or for your submissions or contributions.
