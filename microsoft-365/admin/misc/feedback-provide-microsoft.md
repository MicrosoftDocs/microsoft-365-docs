# Learn about how to provide feedback to Microsoft

Microsoft values your feedback, and every day we look at feedback from users across our diverse products and services on all platforms.  By providing clear feedback, you can make the greatest impact on the products and features you'd like to see or improve.

## How to give great feedback

Whether you’re providing feedback directly in an application or website, through the Feedback portal, or in the [Windows Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub), there are some simple steps you can take to make your feedback as strong as possible.

- If you're using a community feedback experience, Microsoft will prioritize feedback that high volumes of our users are experiencing or requesting.  You can see if feedback you want to provide already exists by searching to browse existing feedback to see if your feedback has already been mentioned by someone in the community.  It’s possible that you have the same feedback as someone else, and you can add your voice to the existing feedback rather than creating a copy of it.  If you can’t find feedback like yours, it’s time to add new feedback
- When providing feedback to Microsoft, it’s important that you keep your comments specific to a single topic at a time.  Product teams are continuously reading feedback, and when we see similar feedback from different users, we try to combine it to see the full impact to our user base. Providing feedback about a single topic at a time helps us to link similar feedback together.
- If you’re experiencing an issue, try to describe the steps you took that caused that issue to occur.  It’s great to know if the problem is intermittent or happens every time, so our product teams can take a look at it and try to reproduce the problem.  If you're using Windows Feedback Hub and your diagnostic settings allow it, you can use the “Recreate my problem” feature to attach screenshots and diagnostic logs as you reproduce the issue you’re facing.  Typically, more details are better.  If you're using an app and it tends to crash every time an action is performed, include that in your description in addition to telling us that the application is crashing.
- Whenever you provide feedback, remember not to provide any identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses, and make sure to avoid leaving personal information in any screenshots you attach.  Feedback submitted on community platforms can be seen by other users, and you wouldn't want to expose personal data.
- When you're finished submitting your feedback, you can log into the Feedback portal to view feedback you previously sent to Microsoft and see the status of that feedback.  If you provided feedback on Windows Feedback Hub, you can open the app and view your My Feedback section to see the status of your feedback.

## Where to provide feedback

### Sending feedback from within an application

There are many places you can provide feedback to Microsoft.  Within an application, you may be able to enter the Help or Feedback menu and find Send feedback button, which will open a form to provide your feedback to Microsoft.

Depending on the platform and application, you may be able to submit additional logs and screenshots.  These are helpful for the product teams at Microsoft to understand your feedback, so please include screenshots and logs when possible.

### Sending feedback from Feedback, our community feedback web portal

If you're using [Feedback](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/), you can provide feedback directly within the web portal.  Community feedback allows you to browse or vote on feedback from the community. Community feedback is publicly displayed within different forums. Your user name will be displayed by feedback you submit publicly or comments you provide.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/sending-feedback-community-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Selection of Microsoft products you can send feedback on":::

Selecting a forum allows you to see all feedback related to that product, and you can upvote or comment on feedback that matches yours.  If you don't see feedback that is similar to your own, you can submit new feedback through the portal itself.

### Sending feedback from Windows Feedback Hub

If you're using Windows Feedback Hub, you can provide feedback from within the Feedback Hub application.  For more details on using Feedback Hub, you can [read this article](/windows-insider/feedback).  Feedback Hub allows you to also view feedback from other users in the community directly from your Windows device.  You may also browse, upvote, or comment on existing feedback, or submit your own using the new feedback form to provide bug reports or feature suggestions.

## Deleting public feedback

If you submitted feedback publicly on the Feedback web portal that you wish to delete, you can remove it by navigating to your My Feedback section.  Then, select the feedback item you wish to delete, and select “Delete.”  You'll be presented with a warning that deleting feedback is irreversible, and that by removing your feedback it will remove all comments, votes, flags, and follows associated with it.

## How Microsoft uses feedback

Once your feedback is sent to Microsoft, it's routed to the relevant product teams who can review it. We look at new feedback that comes in to evaluate if other users have reported similar feedback, and we try to group these similar feedback reports together to surface the most impactful issues and help prioritize future work.
Through Windows Feedback Hub and the Feedback web portal, Microsoft has the ability to update the status of your feedback and respond to it.  We can’t promise to respond to every single feedback report, but we do try to evaluate all feedback that comes in to help prioritize product changes.

### What responses can I expect?

You'll see each feedback card on the feedback portal tagged with one of the statuses below. You can find this status tag as shown in the screenshot below.
