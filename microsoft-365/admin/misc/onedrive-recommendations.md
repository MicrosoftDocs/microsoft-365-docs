# OneDrive recommendations

Start using OneDrive, Microsoft cloud service to store and protect files, share them with others, and access them from anywhere on all their devices. OneDrive comes with Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family subscription. In these subscriptions, you can share documents and photos with friends and family, and collaborate in real time in Microsoft 365. OneDrive can help you quickly organize and find the things that matter. OneDrive integrates with Microsoft 365 so users can access Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents from OneDrive.

## Cloud Storage and backup files

Save files directly to a central location by saving from within a Microsoft 365 program (such as Excel, Word, or PowerPoint). For more information, see [Save documents online](https://support.microsoft.com/office/save-documents-online-8ba1f596-6bc9-4e35-99d4-e27a40037789#:~:text=Saving%20your%20files%20to%20the,OneDrive%2C%20sign%20in%20to%20Office.&text=With%20a%20document%20open%20in,File%20%3E%20Save%20As%20%3E%20OneDrive.).

### Store files in a central location

1. Open the Microsoft 365 document you want to save.

2. Select **File** > **Save As** > **OneDrive**.

3. Enter a file name and then select **Save** to save your document to OneDrive.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If prompted, select Sign In.

4. To find your files later, open the Microsoft 365 app that you created the file in and check the Recent list.

You can also use your web browser to upload and save files to a central location. To learn more, see [Upload and save files and folders to OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/upload-and-save-files-and-folders-to-onedrive-a1397e56-61ec-4ed2-9dac-727bf8ac3357).

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/).
2. Go to the app launcher and select **OneDrive**.
3. Select the **Upload** button.
4. Once a window pops up, select the location of the file or folder you want to save.

## Easily back up your files

Back up important folders on your PC (such as your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders) with OneDrive, so they’re protected and available on other devices. For more information, see [Turn on OneDrive Backup](https://support.microsoft.com/office/turn-on-onedrive-backup-4e44ceab-bcdf-4d17-9ae0-6f00f6080adb).

1. Open OneDrive settings (select the OneDrive cloud icon in your notification area, and then select the OneDrive Help and Settings icon, then Settings.)
2. Go to the **Sync and back up** tab.
3. Select **Manage Back up** and select the files and folder you want to back up.
4. Select **Start backup**.

To learn more about its usage and functionalities, see the following articles:

- [Overview of OneDrive for Business](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-onedrive-work-or-school-10f5c3fd-b0f6-40e2-9059-04735ffe01b7).

- [OneDrive for Business video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/onedrive-video-training-1f608184-b7e6-43ca-8753-2ff679203132).

## Secure sharing and file management

Share access to folders or files with specific people for easier collaboration with them. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

### Securely share files

1. Select the **circle** icon for the files or folders you want to share.
2. Select **Share**, located at the top of the page.
3. Go to **Send Link** and select **Anyone with the link can edit** to open the link settings.
4. Change the link permissions to **Specific people**.
5. Enter the email address of the person you want to share the file with.
6. Select **Send**.

Use **Copy link** to share a file with users inside or outside your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

1. Select the **circle** icon for the files or folders you want to share.

6. Go to **Copy link** and select **Copy**.
7. Paste the link into an email, message, or post, and send it to the recipients.

## Real time co-authoring

Work together, in real time, on shared documents instead of sending back and forth file attachments. This prevents you from having to reconcile multiple versions of the same document. For more information, see [Work together on Office documents](https://support.microsoft.com/office/work-together-on-office-documents-ea3807bc-2b73-406f-a8c9-a493de18258b).

1. Upload your documents to OneDrive.

2. Go to the top of the Microsoft 365 app window and select **Share** to generate a shareable link.

3. Send the link to people you want to access the document.

4. When recipients open the link, the document opens in their browser.

5. To edit, select the command for editing in the Microsoft 365 for the web app. You can edit the document in the browser or the application.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If others are also editing the document, Microsoft 365 alerts you to their presence, and shows you where in the file they’re working.

## Protect shared files by adding a password and expiration

With a Microsoft 365 subscription, you can add expiration dates and passwords to files you share in OneDrive to make them more secure. For more information, see [Use expiration dates and passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/office/video-use-expiration-dates-and-passwords-d4a5a9d9-5cc8-416d-8bb9-90d6c17fd919).

1. In your browser, select a file or folder.

2. Select **Share** and then select **Link settings**.

3. Set an expiration date.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The link works until the expiration date.

4. Set a strong password.

5. Select **Apply**

6. Enter names, email addresses, and a message, and then select **Send**.

7. Send the password in a separate message so recipients can open the file.

## Classify and protect company data

Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to enable support for sensitivity labels. For more information, see [Enable sensitivity labels for files in SharePoint and OneDrive](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files).

1. Sign in to [the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) as a global administrator.

2. Select **Solutions** and then **Information protection**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don’t immediately see this option, first select **Show all**.

3. If you see a message to turn on the ability to process content in Office online files, select **Turn on now**. The command runs immediately and when the page is next refreshed, you no longer see the message or button.

## Information protection notification

Use Sensitivity labels, from Microsoft Purview Information Protection, to classify and protect your organization’s data. To learn more, see [Learn about sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

## Sensitivity labels in Excel

To apply sensitivity labels, users must be signed in with their Microsoft 365 work or school account.
