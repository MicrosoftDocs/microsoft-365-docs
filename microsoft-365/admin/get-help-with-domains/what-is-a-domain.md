# What is a domain?

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
A domain is a unique name that appears after the **@** sign in email addresses, and after **www.** in web addresses. It typically takes the form of your organization's name and a standard Internet suffix, such as *yourbusiness.<span>com* or *stateuniversity.<span>edu*. 
  
Using a custom domain like *rob@contoso.<span>com* with Microsoft 365 can help build credibility and recognition for your brand. 
  
## Choose the experience that's best for you:

 **Buy a new Domain:**
  
Use Microsoft 365 to buy a new domain - we'll set everything up. [Learn more.](buy-a-domain-name.md)
  
 **Use a domain you already own:**
  
If you already own a domain like  *you@yourcompany.<span>com*  you can add it and start using OneDrive and Microsoft apps right away. You'll need to take a few minutes to setup mail and Skype for Business. 
  
> [!TIP]
> Not sure where your domain is registered? - [Get help finding your domain registrar](find-your-domain-registrar.md)
  
 **Use a default domain for now:**
  
You can use a default domain like  *yourcompany.onmicrosoft.<span>com*  to log in for now and add a custom domain later. You can't change or rename your default domain - so make sure it's what you want before moving on.
