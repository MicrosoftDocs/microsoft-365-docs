# Set up your domain (host-specific instructions)

To start using a custom domain (contoso.com) with Microsoft 365, you need to verify your domain and configure your domain's DNS records. 
  
You can add and manage DNS records using the administrative tools at your domain host, or give Microsoft control of your domain records and we'll set them up for you.

## Let Microsoft 365 manage your DNS records 

Learn how to [change nameservers to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

## Manage your own DNS records

For instructions, see [Create DNS records at ny DNS hosting provider](create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider.md)
