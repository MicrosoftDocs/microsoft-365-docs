# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Yammer device usage report

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out the [Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
The Yammer device usage reports give you information about which devices your users are using Yammer on. You can view the number of daily users by device type, and number of users by device type. You can view both over a selected time period. You can also view details per user.

You also can export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the Export link. This link exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.

The **Yammer device usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
