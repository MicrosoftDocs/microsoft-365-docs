# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft 365 groups

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft 365 groups report, you can gain insights into the activity of groups in your organization and see how many groups are being created and used.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.  
  
## How to get to the groups report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Active users - Microsoft 365 Apps or the Active users - Microsoft 365 Services card to get to the Office 365 report page.
  
## Interpret the groups report

You can view the activations in the Office 365 report by choosing the **Groups activity** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Office 365 groups activity.](../../media/ab90e30b-8938-4110-ab3d-ee472a4cfe21.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data.
