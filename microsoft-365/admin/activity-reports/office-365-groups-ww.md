# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft 365 groups

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft 365 groups report, you can gain insights into the activity of groups in your organization and see how many groups are being created and used.

## How to get to the groups report

1. In the admin center, select **Reports**, and then select **Usage**.

2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Active users - Microsoft 365 Apps or the Active users - Microsoft 365 Services card to get to the Office 365 report page.

## Interpret the groups report

You can view the activations in the Office 365 report by choosing the **Groups activity** tab.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The **groups** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

### GroupID hidden by default
When you export the report data, you will by default not be able to view the **GroupID** variable in the Excel .csv file that you download. If you want to view GroupID information and all other identifiable information in Microsoft 365 usage reports, you can use choose to  [show user details in reports](../../admin/activity-reports/activity-reports.md#show-user-details-in-the-reports) through the organizational settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center.  You must be a global administrator to make these changes.
