# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams apps usage reports

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the **Microsoft Teams app usage report**, you can gain insights into the Teams apps activity in your organization. This article explains how to access the report and view and interpret the various metrics within the report.

You can use this report to understand who is installing/using apps, and deep dive on a per-app and per-user level.

## What's in the report

The Teams app usage report is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the data is provided through two separate reports:

**App usage** - This report helps you answer:

- How many apps have users in your environment installed?
- How many apps have at least one active user in your environment?
- How many apps are being used by platform (Windows, Mac, Web, or mobile)?
- How many active users and active teams are using the app?

**User activity** - This report helps you answer:

- How many users in your environment have installed at least one app?
- How many users in your environment have used at least one app?
- How many users are using an app across platforms (Windows, Mac, Web, etc.)?
- How many apps has each user used?

## How to get to the Microsoft Teams apps usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page.
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Microsoft Teams apps activity card.

## Considerations

- Usage/installs data for a newly published app can take about five days to show up in the report. Data for a given day will show up within 48 hours. For example, data for January 10th should show up in the report by around January 12th.

- The start date for all installs metrics is October 2021. Only apps installed after that date will be counted.

- App IDs in this report are the External (manifest) App IDs. For more information on how to tie this ID to an app in the Manage Apps experience in Teams Admin Center, see [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#install-apps.md).

- You can export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the Export link. This exports data for all users/apps and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.
