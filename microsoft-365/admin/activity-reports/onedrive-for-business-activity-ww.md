# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - OneDrive for Business activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It lets you drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
For example, you can understand the activity of every user licensed to use OneDrive by looking at their interaction with files on OneDrive. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the number of files shared.

## How do I get to the OneDrive Activity report?

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the OneDrive card.
  
## Interpret the OneDrive for Business activity report

You can view the activities in the OneDrive report by choosing the **Activity** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft OneDrive activity report.](../../media/c89df0b0-2611-4acf-9ef7-17cedf7977be.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![OneDrive activity report - choose columns.](../../media/252f311f-ffde-4e5a-9158-2b822bf86964.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The **OneDrive for Business activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
