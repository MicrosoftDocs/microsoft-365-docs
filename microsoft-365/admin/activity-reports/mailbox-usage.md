# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Mailbox usage

The **Mailbox usage report** provides information about users with a user mailbox and the level of activity by each based on the email send, read, create appointment, send meeting, accept meeting, decline meeting and cancel meeting activity. It also provides information about how much storage has been consumed by each user mailbox, and how many of them are approaching storage quotas. The mailbox usage report also contains information on mailboxes shared amongst users, providing storage and quota data on shared mailboxes.
 
## How to get to the mailbox usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page.
2. Select **View More** under **Email activity**. 
3. From the **Email activity** drop-down list, select **Exchange** \> **Mailbox usage**.

## Interpret the Mailbox usage report

You can get a view into your organization's mailbox usage by looking at the **Mailbox**, **Storage** and **Quota** charts.

To access shared mailbox information, change the drop-down selection at the top right of the charts to **Shared**.  If your tenant does not have shared mailboxes, you will not be able to view any shared mailbox information.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not currently be able to export the summary chart information for shared mailboxes. This is a known issue and will be corrected in a future iteration.

The **Mailbox usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated). The data in each report usually covers up to the last 24 to 48 hours.

### The Mailbox chart

The **Mailbox** chart shows you the total number of user or shared mailboxes in your organization, and the total number of user mailboxes that are active on any given day of the reporting period. A user mailbox is considered active if it had an email send, read, create appointment, send meeting, accept meeting, decline meeting and cancel meeting activity.

> [!NOTE]
> Shared mailboxes do not have activity independent of a user mailbox so only a count of shared mailboxes will be shown when this mailbox type is selected.

On the Mailbox chart:
- The Y axis is the number of user or shared mailboxes. 
- The X axis is the selected date range for this specific report.

### The Storage chart

The **Storage** chart shows you amount of storage used in your organization by mailbox type. Storage Chart doesn't include archive mailboxes. For more information about auto-expanding archiving, see [Overview of auto-expanding archiving in Microsoft 365](../../compliance/autoexpanding-archiving.md).

On the Storage chart:
- The Y axis is the amount of storage being used by user or shared mailboxes in your organization.
- The X axis is the selected date range for this specific report.

### The Quota chart

The **Quota** chart shows you the number of user or shared mailboxes in each quota category. There are four quota categories: 
- Good: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is below the "issue warning" quota.
- Warning: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the "issue warning" quota, but below the "prohibit send" quota.
- Can't send: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the prohibit send quota, but below the prohibit send/receive quota.
- Can't send/receive: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the "prohibit send/receive" quota.

On the Quota chart:
- The Y axis is the number of user or shared mailboxes in each storage quota.
- The X axis is the quota category.

You can filter charts you see by selecting an item in the legend.
