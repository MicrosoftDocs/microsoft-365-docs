# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams usage activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).

The brand-new **Teams usage report** gives you an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users, channels and messages so you can quickly see how many users across your organization are using Teams to communicate and collaborate.  It also includes other Teams specific activities, such as the number of active guests, meetings, and messages.

## Interpret the Microsoft Teams usage activity report

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.  The exported format for **audio time**, **video time**, and **screen share time** follows ISO8601 duration format.

The **Microsoft Teams usage activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

To ensure data quality, we perform daily data validation checks for the past three days and will be filling any gaps detected. You may notice differences in historical data during the process.

> [!Important]
> Data for a given day will show up within 48 hours. For example, data for January 10th should show up in the report by January 12th.

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

To make the data in Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. This will hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, email, and Azure Active Directory Object ID in report and their export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and under **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.

2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display anonymous identifiers**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center.

3. Select **Save changes**.
