# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It lets you drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
For example, you can understand the activity of every user licensed to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice by looking at their interactions with Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the number of Pro Surveys created and Pro Surveys to which the users responded to.

## How to get to the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports**, then select **Usage**. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice card.
