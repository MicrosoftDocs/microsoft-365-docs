# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It lets you drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
For example, you can understand the activity of every user licensed to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice by looking at their interactions with Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the number of Pro Surveys created and Pro Surveys to which the users responded to. 
  
## How to get to the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice card.
  
## Interpret the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity report

You can view the activities in the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice report by choosing the **Activity** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity report.](../../media/a7e57d18-1ac8-4d4b-bd70-83361505dc3e.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity report - choose columns.](../../media/5ab66f4b-32eb-4c9b-9683-1157ae9e2c0a.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data. 

The **Dynamics 365 Customer Voice activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
