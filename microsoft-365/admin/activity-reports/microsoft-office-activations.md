# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Office activations

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
The Office Activation report gives you a view of which users have activated their Office subscription on at least one device. It provides a breakdown of the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Project, and Visio Pro for Office 365 subscription activations, as well as the breakdown of activations across desktop and devices. This report could be useful in helping you identify users that might need additional help and support to activate their Office subscription.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.

|Item|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|1  <br/> |The Office Activations report presents the current state of the office license activations data [as of the date of the report presented on the top right of the chart].  <br/> |
|2  <br/> |The data in each report usually covers up to the last 24 to 48 hours.  <br/> |
|3  <br/> |The **Activations** chart shows you the count of Office activations on desktops and devices.  <br/> |
|4  <br/> |The **Users** chart shows you the count of users that are enabled, and users that have activated the Office subscription on desktop or devices..  <br/> |
|5  <br/> | On the **Activations** chart, the Y axis is the count of Office activations.  <br/>  On the **Users** chart, the Y axis is the user's performing activity of activating Office.  <br/>  The X axis on both charts is the selected date range for this specific report.  <br/> |
|6  <br/> |You can filter charts you see by selecting an item in the legend. For example, on the **Activations** chart, select **Windows OS**, **Mac OS**, **Windows 10 mobile**, **iOS** or **Android** to see only the info related to each one. Changing this selection doesn't change the info in the grid table. <br/> ![Activation data for devices](../../media/59d3ec6e-2a6e-4b21-8aac-c73038c47b9f.png)  <br/> |
