# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams user activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft Teams user activity report, you can gain insights into the Microsoft Teams activity in your organization.
 
## How to get to the Microsoft Teams user activity report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page.

2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Microsoft Teams activity card.

## Interpret the Microsoft Teams user activity report

You can view the user activity in the Teams report by choosing the **User activity** tab. <br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Teams user activity.](../../media/user-activity-charts.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![Teams user activity report - choose columns.](../../media/user-activity-columns.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you'll need to export the data. The exported format for **audio time**, **video time**, and **screen share time** follows ISO8601 duration format.

The **Microsoft Teams user activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

To ensure data quality, we perform daily data validation checks for the past three days and will be filling any gaps detected. You may notice differences in historical data during the process.

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

To make the data in Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. This will hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, email, and Azure Active Directory Object ID in report and their export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and under **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.

2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display anonymous identifiers**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center.

3. Select **Save changes**.
