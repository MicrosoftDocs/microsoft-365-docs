# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center

You can easily see how people in your business are using Microsoft 365 services. For example, you can identify who is using a service a lot and reaching quotas, or who may not need an Microsoft 365 license at all. Perpetual license model will not be included in the reports. 
  
Reports are available for the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days. Data won't exist for all reporting periods right away. The reports become available within 48 hours.

## How to view licensing information

- To see how many licenses you have assigned and unassigned, in the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page.
    
- To see who is licensed, unlicensed, or guest, in the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page. 
  
## How to view usage information for a specific user

Use the service reports to research how much a specific user is using the service. For example, to find out how much mailbox storage a specific user has consumed, open the Mailbox usage report, and sort the users by name. If you have thousands of users, export the report to Excel so you filter through the list quickly.
  
You can't generate a report where you enter a user's account and then get a list of which services they are using and how much.

There are circumstances where new users show up as **unknown**. This is usually due to occasional delays in creating user profiles.  
  
## Hide user details in the reports

If you want to hide user level information when you're generating your reports, you can quickly make that change in the admin center.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743" target="_blank">Services &amp; add-ins</a> page.

2. Select **Reports**. 
  
3. In the **Reports** pane, select the options you want, and then save your changes.
  
Your user list will look like this:
  
![Reports - anonymized user list](../../media/2ed99bce-4978-4ee3-9ea2-4a8db26eef02.png)
  
It'll take a few minutes for these changes to take effect on the reports in the reports dashboard. This setting also applies to the reports API.
  
## What happens to usage data when a user account is closed?

Whenever you close a user's account, Microsoft will delete that user's usage data within 30 days. That user will still be included in the Activity chart totals (see number 1) for the periods she was active in, but will not appear in the User Details table (see number 2).
  
However, when you select a particular day (see number 3), up to 28 days from the current date, the report show the user's usage for that day in the User Details table (see number 2).
