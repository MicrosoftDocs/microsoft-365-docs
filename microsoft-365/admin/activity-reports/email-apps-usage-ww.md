# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Email apps usage

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the email apps usage report, you can see how many email apps are connecting to Exchange Online. You can also see the version information of Outlook apps that users are using, which will allow you to follow up with those who are using unsupported versions to install supported versions of Outlook.
  
## How to get to the email apps report

2. Select **View More** under **Email activity**. 
3. From the **Email activity** drop-down list, select **Exchange** \> **Email apps usage**.

|1.  <br/> |The **Email apps usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).  <br/> |

|5.  <br/> |The **Versions** view shows you the number of unique users for each version of Outlook in Windows.  <br/> |
|6.  <br/> | On the **Users** chart, the Y axis is the total count of unique users that connected to an app on any day of the reporting period.  <br/>  On the **Users** chart, the X axis is number of unique users that used the app for that reporting period.  <br/>  On the **Apps** chart, the Y axis is the total count of unique users who used a specific app during the reporting period.  <br/>  On the **Apps** chart, the X axis is the list of apps in your organization.  <br/>  On the **Versions** chart, the Y axis is the total count of unique users using a specific version of Outlook desktop. If the report can't resolve the version number of Outlook, the quantity will show as **Undetermined**.  <br/>  On the **Versions** chart, the X axis is the list of apps in your organization.  <br/> |
