# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Viva Engage activity report

As Microsoft 365 admin, the Reports dashboard shows you data on the usage of the products within your organization. Check out [activity reports in the admin center](activity-reports.md). With the **Viva Engage Activity report**, you can understand the level of engagement of your organization with Viva Engage by looking at the number of unique users using Viva Engage to post, like or read a message and the amount of activity generated across the organization.
 
## How do I get to the Viva Engage activity report?

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports**, and then select **Usage**. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Viva Engage card.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The **Viva Engage activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
