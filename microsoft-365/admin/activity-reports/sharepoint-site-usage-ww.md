# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - SharePoint site usage

As a Microsoft 365 admin, the Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across various products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to get more granular insight about the activities specific to each product. For example, you can get a high-level view of the value you are getting from SharePoint in terms of the total number of files that users store in SharePoint sites, how many files are actively being used, and the storage consumed across all these sites. Then, you can drill into the SharePoint site usage report to understand the trends and per site level details for all sites.

## How to get to the SharePoint site usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the SharePoint card.

## Show user details in the reports

Reports provide information about your organization’s usage data. By default, reports display information with identifiable names for users, groups, and sites. Starting September 1, 2021, we are hiding user information by default for all reports as part of our ongoing commitment to help companies support their local privacy laws.
  
Your user list will look like this:
  
![Reports - anonymized user list.](../../media/2ed99bce-4978-4ee3-9ea2-4a8db26eef02.png)
  
Global administrators can revert this change for their tenant and show identifiable user information if their organization's privacy practices allow it. It can be achieved in the Microsoft 365 admin center by following these steps:
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Org Settings** \> **Services** page.

2. Select **Reports**. 
  
3. Uncheck the statement **In all reports, display de-identified names for users, groups, and sites**, and then save your changes. 
  
## Interpret the SharePoint site usage report

You can view the site usage in the SharePoint report by choosing the **Site usage** tab.

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The **SharePoint site usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
