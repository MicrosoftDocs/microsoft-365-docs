# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - SharePoint site usage

As a Microsoft 365 admin, the **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across various products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to get more granular insight about the activities specific to each product. For example, you can get a high level view of the value you are getting from SharePoint in terms of the total number of files that users store in SharePoint sites, how many files are actively being used, and the storage consumed across all these sites. Then, you can drill into the SharePoint site usage report to understand the trends and per site level details for all sites. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.
Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center is not supported for GCC High and DoD tenants.
 
## How to get to the SharePoint site usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the SharePoint card.
  
## Interpret the SharePoint site usage report

You can view the site usage in the SharePoint report by choosing the **Site usage** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft SharePoint site usage report.](../../media/d1cb6200-e81c-460b-9d05-53f4bd7cf5ee.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data.
