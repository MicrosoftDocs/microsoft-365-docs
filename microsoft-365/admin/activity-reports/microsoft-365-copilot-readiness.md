# Microsoft 365 reports in the Admin Center – Copilot for Microsoft 365 readiness

The Microsoft 365 Usage dashboard shows you the activity overview across the Microsoft 365 apps in your organization. It enables you to drill into individual product-level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each app. To view all reports, check out the [Reports overview article](activity-reports.md).

In the Copilot for Microsoft 365 readiness report, which is in continuous enhancement, you can view which users are technically eligible for Copilot, assign licenses, and monitor usage of Microsoft 365 apps that Copilot integrates best with. The report becomes available within 72 hours, and once available, the usage data shown on the report can have up to a maximum of 72 hours latency.

You can use the user table to get an at-a-glance view at which users are assigned a Copilot license, whether their devices are configured correctly, and if they’re using a Microsoft 365 app that has Copilot enabled.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the Export link. This exports the Copilot for Microsoft 365 readiness data of all users with any engagement on Teams meetings, Teams chat, and Outlook email for Office docs in past 30 days, and enables you to do simple sorting, filtering, and searching for further analysis.

To ensure data quality, we perform daily data validation checks for the past three days and will fill any gaps detected. You may notice differences in historical data during the process.
