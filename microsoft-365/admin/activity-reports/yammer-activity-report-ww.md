# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Yammer activity report

As Microsoft 365 admin, the **Reports** dashboard shows you data on the usage of the products within your organization. Check out [activity reports in the admin center](activity-reports.md). With the **Yammer Activity report**, you can understand the level of engagement of your organization with Yammer by looking at the number of unique users using Yammer to post, like or read a message and the amount of activity generated across the organization. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.  
 
## How do I get to the Yammer activity report?

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Yammer card.

  
## Interpret the Yammer activity report

You can view the activities in the Yammer report by choosing the **Activity** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Yammer activity report.](../../media/9b251183-c2b3-430c-ab2d-58bf11e7e3ae.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![Yammer activity report - choose columns](../../media/7ef6351d-f7e9-4504-913d-2c2df9062bf6.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data.
