# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Forms activity

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It lets you drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
For example, you can understand the activity of every user licensed to use Microsoft Forms by looking at their interaction with forms. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the number of forms created and forms the user responded to.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.  
 
## How to get to the Forms activity report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Forms card.
  
## Interpret the Forms activity report

You can view the activities in the Forms report by choosing the **Activity** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Forms activity report.](../../media/275fb0a1-b9d9-4233-8aaf-e7df73cc705f.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![Forms activity report - choose columns](../../media/0c9b0b69-5dc7-43ea-8e2c-54407b6ce2ab.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data.
