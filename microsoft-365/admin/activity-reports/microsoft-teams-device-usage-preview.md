# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams device usage

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft Teams app usage report, you can gain insights into the Microsoft Teams apps that are used in your organization.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports.  
 
## How to get to the Microsoft Teams app usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Microsoft Teams activity card.
  
## Interpret the Microsoft Teams app usage report

You can view the device use in the Teams report by choosing the **Device usage** tab.<br/>![Microsoft 365 reports - Microsoft Teams device usage.](../../media/e46c7f7c-8371-4a20-ae82-b20df64b0205.png)

Select **Choose columns** to add or remove columns from the report.  <br/> ![Teams user device report - choose columns](../../media/3358d5d9-931b-4d30-931f-450b2f5717da.png)

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 2000 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data. 

The **Microsoft Teams device usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table (7) will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
