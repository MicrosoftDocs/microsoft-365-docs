# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Viva Goals activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out the [Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). 

In the Viva Goals report, you can understand the activity of every Viva Goals user in your organization. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the active usage and number of OKRs created. 

## How do I get to the Viva Goals activity report?

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports**, and then select **Usage**. 
2. Find **Viva Goals page**.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the Export link. This exports the Viva Goals usage data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The Viva Goals report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. If you select a particular day in the report, the per user data table will be updated accordingly to display users' usage on that day. However, this feature only works for the most recent 28 days.
