# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Office activations

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
The Office Activation report gives you a view of which users have activated their Office subscription on at least one device. It provides a breakdown of the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Project, and Visio Pro for Office 365 subscription activations, as well as the breakdown of activations across desktop and devices. This report could be useful in helping you identify users that might need additional help and support to activate their Office subscription.
