# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Yammer groups activity report

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Yammer groups activity report, you can gain insights into the activity of Yammer groups in your organization and see how many Yammer groups are being created and used.
 
## How do I get to the Yammer groups activity report?

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports**, then select **Usage**. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Yammer card.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. 

The **Yammer groups activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
