# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft browser usage

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you an activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill into individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). 

The **Microsoft Browser Usage report** in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center lets you see if users access Microsoft 365 online services via Microsoft Edge. This report insight can help you migrate your organization to Microsoft Edge. Usage reporting is based on an aggregate count of users in your organization that sign in to their Microsoft 365 account and use the Microsoft Edge browser to access Microsoft 365 services.

## How to get to the Microsoft browser usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <b><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a></b> page.

2. From the dashboard homepage, click on the **View more** button on the Microsoft browser usage card.

The **Microsoft browser usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. 

The **Daily active users** chart shows you the daily user count for Microsoft Edge when used to access to Microsoft 365 services.

The **Active Users** chart shows you the total number of users accessing Microsoft 365 services while using Microsoft Edge over the selected time period.

The report is internal to your organization with permissions limited to IT admins with existing access to the activity reports on the usage dashboard in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

> [!NOTE]
> Aggregate Microsoft browser usage and user level reporting is available. User level identification can be [removed per your organizationâ€™s policies](activity-reports.md#show-user-details-in-the-reports) and [role based access controls](../../admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles.md) can be used to adjust report access.
