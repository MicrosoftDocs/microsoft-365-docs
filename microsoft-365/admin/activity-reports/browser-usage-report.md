# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft browser usage

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you an activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill into individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft browser usage report, you can gain insights on Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge Legacy, and new Microsoft Edge usage. Usage reporting is based on Microsoft 365 online services accessed via a Microsoft browser.
