# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft browser usage

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you an activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill into individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md). In the Microsoft browser usage report, you can gain insights on new Microsoft Edge usage. Usage reporting is based on an aggregate count of users in your organization that sign in to their Microsoft 365 account and use the Microsoft Edge browser to access Microsoft 365 services.
