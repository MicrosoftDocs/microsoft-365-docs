## Differences in capabilities

Microsoft Intune and built-in Basic Mobility and Security both give you the ability to manage mobile devices in your organization, but there are key differences in capability, described in the following table.

>[!NOTE]
>You can manage users and their mobile devices using both Intune and Basic Mobility and Security in the same Microsoft 365 Business Standard organization by setting up Basic Mobility and Security first, and then adding Microsoft Intune. This allows you to choose whether you manage a user’s devices with Basic Mobility and Security or the more feature-rich Intune solution. In the mode, the license assignment determines which service the device is enrolled with. Assign an Intune license to enable the Intune-only features.
