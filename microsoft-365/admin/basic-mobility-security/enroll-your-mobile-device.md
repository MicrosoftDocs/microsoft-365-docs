# Enroll your mobile device using Basic Mobility and Security

Using your phone, tablet, and other mobile devices for work is a great way to stay informed and work on business projects while you’re away from the office. Before you can use Microsoft 365 services with your device, you might need to first enroll it in Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365 using Microsoft Intune Company Portal.
 
Organizations choose Basic Mobility and Security so that employees can use their mobile devices to securely access work email, calendars, and documents while the business secures important data and meets their compliance requirements. To learn more, see [Overview of Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365](overview.md). For more info, see [What information can my organization see when I enroll my device?](/intune-user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you enroll your device in Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365, you might be required to set up a password, together with allowing the option for your work organization to wipe the device. A device wipe can be performed from the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, for example, to remove all data from the device if the password is entered incorrectly too many times or if usage terms are broken.
