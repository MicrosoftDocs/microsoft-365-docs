# Privacy and security in Basic Mobility and Security

Basic Mobility and Security is a cloud-based service powered by Microsoft Intune that helps you manage and secure mobile devices in your organization. After you activate Basic Mobility and Security, you can create mobile device management policies. These policies can then be deployed to mobile devices that have been enrolled by licensed Microsoft 365 users in your organization.

Microsoft Intune sends information to Microsoft 365 about the compliance status of each managed device, and then you can generate reports that show whether managed devices in your organization are compliant based upon the policies that were set. To learn more about Microsoft's commitment to the privacy and security, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).
