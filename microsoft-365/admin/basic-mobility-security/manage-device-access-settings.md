# Manage device access settings in Basic Mobility and Security

If you're using Basic Mobility and Security, there might be devices that you can't manage with Basic Mobility and Security. If so, you should block Exchange ActiveSync app access to Microsoft 365 email for mobile devices that aren't supported by Basic Mobility and Security. This helps secure your organization information across more devices.

Use these steps:

1. Sign in to  Microsoft 365 with your global admin account.

2. In your browser, type: [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com/).    

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If this is the first time you're using Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365 Business Standard, activate it here: [Activate Basic Security and Mobility](https://admin.microsoft.com/EAdmin/Device/IntuneInventory.aspx). After you've activated it, manage your devices with [Office 365 Security & Compliance](https://protection.office.com/).

3. Go to Data loss prevention > **Device management** > **Device policies**, and select **Manage organization-wide device access settings**.
