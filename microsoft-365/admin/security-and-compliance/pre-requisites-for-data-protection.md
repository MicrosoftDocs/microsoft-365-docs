# Prerequisites for protecting data on devices with Microsoft 365 for business

This article applies to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

The first step in setting up your organization with Microsoft 365 for business is to make sure you can meet the prerequisites.
  
## Requirements for setting up your organization with Microsoft 365 for business

- Windows devices must be running Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro.
    
    [Upgrade Windows devices to Windows Pro Creators Update](upgrade-to-windows-pro-creators-update.md)
    
    If you're running Windows 10 Home, then you must **purchase** Windows  10 Pro. See [upgrade Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro](../business-video/upgrade.md) for instructions. 
    
- Remove devices from mobile management solutions (Mobile Iron, AirWatch, and so on). You'll enroll all the people in your organization in Microsoft 365 for business mobile management.
    
- Apple iOS 8.0 and later.
    
    Google Android 4.0 and later (including Samsung KNOX Standard 4.0 and higher). For more information, see [Intune supported devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers).
    
- If you have existing Office applications on user computers, read [prepare for Office client installation](prepare-for-office-client-deployment.md) to understand steps you might need to take before you can set up Microsoft 365 for business to install Office 2016 on user computers.
