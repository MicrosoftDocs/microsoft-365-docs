# Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Multifactor authentication means you and your employees must provide more than one way to sign in to Microsoft 365 is one of the easiest ways to secure your business. Based on your understanding of [multifactor authentication (MFA) and its support in Microsoft 365](multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md), it's time to set it up and roll it out to your organization.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a very important first step in securing your organization. Microsoft 365 for Business gives you the option to use security defaults or Conditional Access policies to turn on MFA for your admins and user accounts. For most organizations, **Security defaults** offer a good level of sign-in security. But if your organization must meet more stringent requirements, you can use **Conditional Access policies** instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you purchased your subscription or trial after October 21, 2019, and you're prompted for MFA when you sign in, [security defaults](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) have been automatically enabled for your subscription.

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/ " target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
1. Select  **Show All**, then choose the **Azure Active Directory Admin Center**.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**, **Properties**, **Manage Security defaults**.
1. Under **Enable Security defaults**, select **Yes** and then **Save**.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global admin to manage MFA. For more information, see [About admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- If you have legacy per-user MFA turned on, [Turn off legacy per-user MFA](#turn-off-legacy-per-user-mfa).
- If you have Office 2013 clients on Windows devices, [turn on Modern Authentication for Office 2013 clients](./enable-modern-authentication.md).
- Advanced: If you have third-party directory services with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), set up the Azure MFA Server. See [advanced scenarios with Azure AD Multifactor Authentication and third-party VPN solutions](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-nps-vpn) for more information.

### Turn off legacy per-user MFA

Per-user MFA is a legacy service and you should give consideration to using the newer Security defaults or Conditional Access policies.

If you've previously turned on per-user MFA, you must turn it off before enabling Security defaults.  You should also turn off per-user MFA after you've configure your policies and settings in Conditional Access.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left nav choose **Users** \> **Active users**.
1. On the **Active users** page, choose **Multi-factor authentication**.
1. On the multi-factor authentication page, select each user and set their Multi-Factor auth status to **Disabled**.

## Turn Security defaults on or off

For most organizations, Security defaults offer a good level of additional sign-in security. For more information, see [What are security defaults?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults)

If your subscription is new, Security defaults might already be turned on for you automatically.

You enable or disable security defaults from the **Properties** pane for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) with global admin credentials.
2. In the left nav choose **Show All** and under **Admin centers**, choose **Azure Active Directory**.
3. In the **Azure Active Directory admin center** choose **Azure Active Directory** \> **Properties**.
4. At the bottom of the page, choose **Manage Security defaults**.
5. Choose **Yes** to enable security defaults or **No** to disable security defaults, and then choose **Save**.

If you have been using [baseline Conditional Access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-baseline-protection), you'll be prompted to turn them off before you move to using security defaults.

1. Go to the [Conditional Access - Policies page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade/Policies).
2. Choose each baseline policy that is **On** and set **Enable policy** to **Off**.
3. Go to the [Azure Active Directory - Properties page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Properties).
4. At the bottom of the page, choose **Manage Security defaults**.
5. Choose **Yes** to enable security defaults and **No** to disable security defaults, and then choose **Save**.

## Use Conditional Access policies

If your organization has more granular sign-in security needs, Conditional Access policies can offer you more control. Conditional Access lets you create and define policies that react to sign in events and request additional actions before a user is granted access to an application or service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not forget to disable per-user MFA after you have enabled Conditional Access policies. This is important as it will result in inconsistent user experience.

Conditional Access is available for customers who have purchased Azure AD Premium P1, or licenses that include this, such as Microsoft 365 Business Premium, and Microsoft 365 E3. For more information, see [create a Conditional Access policy](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa).

Risk-based conditional access is available through Azure AD Premium P2 license, or licenses that include this, such as Microsoft 365 E5. For more information, see [risk-based Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk).

For more information about the Azure AD P1 and P2, see [Azure Active Directory pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

### Turn on Modern authentication for your organization

For most subscriptions modern authentication is automatically turned on, but if you purchased your subscription before August 2017, it's likely that you'll need to turn on Modern Authentication in order to get features like Multifactor Authentication to work in Windows clients like Outlook.

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, in the left nav choose **Settings** \> **Org settings**.
2. Under the **Services** tab, choose **Modern authentication**, and in the **Modern authentication** pane, make sure **Enable Modern authentication** is selected. Choose **Save changes**.
