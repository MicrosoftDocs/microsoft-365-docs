# Enable Modern Authentication for Office 2013 on Windows devices

To enable modern authentication for any Windows devices that have Office 2013 installed, you need to set specific registry keys.
  
## Enable modern authentication for Office 2013 clients

> [!NOTE]
> Modern authentication is already enabled for Office 2016 clients, you do not need to set registry keys for Office 2016. 
  
To enable modern authentication for any devices running Windows (for example on laptops and tablets), that have Microsoft Office 2013 installed, you need to set the following registry keys. The keys need to be set on each device that you want to enable for modern authentication:
  
|**Registry key**|**Type**|**Value** |
|:-------|:------:|--------:|
|HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\EnableADAL  |REG_DWORD  |1  |
|HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\Version |REG_DWORD |1 |
   
Once you've set the registry keys, you can set Office 2013 devices apps to use [multifactor authentication (MFA)](set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md) with Microsoft 365. 
  
If you're currently signed-in with any of the client apps, you need to sign out and sign back in for the change to take effect. Otherwise, the MRU and roaming settings will be unavailable until the identity is established.
  
## Disable modern authentication on devices

To disable modern authentication on a device, set the following registry keys on the device:
  
|**Registry key**|**Type**|**Value**|
|:-------|:------:|--------:|
|HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\EnableADAL |REG_DWORD|0|
