If you have Microsoft Business Premium, the quickest way to setup security and begin collaborating safely is to follow the guidance in this library: [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md). This guidance was developed in partnership with the Microsoft Defending Democracy team to protect all small business customers against cyberthreats that are launched by sophisticated hackers.

Before you begin, check your [Microsoft 365 Secure Score](../../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.md) in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>. From a centralized dashboard, you can monitor and improve the security for your Microsoft 365 identities, data, apps, devices, and infrastructure. You are given points for configuring recommended security features, performing security-related tasks (such as viewing reports), or addressing recommendations with a third-party application or software. With added insights and more visibility into a broader set of Microsoft products and services, you can feel confident reporting about your organization's security health.

## 1: Set up multi-factor authentication

Protect against lost or stolen passwords by using multifactor authentication (MFA). When multifactor authentication is set up, it requires people to use a code on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365. This extra step can prevent hackers from taking over if they know your password. 

Multifactor authentication is also called 2-step verification. Individuals can add 2-step verification to most accounts easily, for example, to their Google or Microsoft accounts. Here's how to [add two-step verification to your personal Microsoft account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2016403).

For businesses using Microsoft 365, add a setting that requires your users to log in using multifactor authentication. When you make this change, users will be prompted to set up their phone for two-factor authentication next time they log in.
To see a training video for how to set up MFA and how users complete the setup, see [set up MFA](set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md) and [user set up](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14).

### To set up multi-factor authentication, you turn on security defaults

For most organizations, security defaults offer a good level of added sign-in security. For more information, see [What are security defaults?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults)

If your subscription is new, security defaults might already be turned on for you automatically.

You enable or disable security defaults from the **Properties** pane for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) with global admin credentials.

2. In the left nav choose **Show All** and under **Admin centers**, choose **Azure Active Directory**.

3. In the **Azure Active Directory admin center**, choose **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties**.

4. At the bottom of the page, choose **Manage Security defaults**.

5. Choose **Yes** to enable security defaults or **No** to disable security defaults, and then choose **Save**.

After you set up multi-factor authentication for your organization, your users will be required to set up two-step verification on their devices. For more information, see [Set up 2-step verification for Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14).

> [!TIP]
> For more details and recommendations, see [Set up multi-factor authentication for users](set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md).

## 2: Train your users

The Harvard Kennedy School [Cybersecurity Campaign Handbook](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2015598) provides excellent guidance on establishing a strong culture of security awareness within your organization, including training users to identify phishing attacks.

In addition, Microsoft recommends that your users take the actions described in this article: [Protect your account and devices from hackers and malware](https://support.microsoft.com/office/066d6216-a56b-4f90-9af3-b3a1e9a327d6). These actions include:

- Using strong passwords

- Protecting devices

- Enabling security features on Windows 10 and Mac PCs

Microsoft also recommends that users protect their personal email accounts by taking the actions recommended in the following articles:

- [Help protect your Outlook.com email account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/a4f20fc5-4307-4ece-8231-6d4d4bd8a9ba)

- [Protect your Gmail account with 2-step verification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2015688&)

## 3: Use dedicated admin accounts

The administrative accounts you use to administer your Microsoft 365 environment include elevated privileges. These are valuable targets for hackers and cyberattackers. Use admin accounts only for administration. Admins should have a separate user account for regular, non-administrative use and only use their administrative account when necessary to complete a task associated with their job function. Additional recommendations:

- Be sure admin accounts are also set up for multi-factor authentication.

- Before using admin accounts, close out all unrelated browser sessions and apps, including personal email accounts.

- After completing admin tasks, be sure to log out of the browser session.

## 4: Protect against malware

Your Microsoft 365 environment includes protection against malware. You can increase your malware protection by:

- Blocking attachments with certain file types
- Using antivirus/antimalware protection on your devices

### Block attachments with certain file types

You can increase your malware protection by blocking attachments with file types that are commonly used for malware. To bump up malware protection in email, view a [short training video](increase-threat-protection.md#raise-the-level-of-protection-against-malware-in-mail), or complete the following steps:

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-malware** in the **Policies** section.

2. On the **Anti-malware** page, double-click on **Default (Default)**. A flyout appears. 

3. Select **Edit protection settings** at the bottom of the flyout. 

4. In the next page, under **Protection settings**, select the checkbox next to **Enable the common attachments filter**. The file types that are blocked are listed directly below this option. To add or delete file types, select **Customize file types** at the end of the list. 

5. Select **Save**. 

For more information, see [Antimalware protection in EOP](../../security/office-365-security/anti-malware-protection.md).

### Use antivirus and antimalware protection

Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides strong antivirus and antimalware protection, and is built into the Windows operating system.

If your organization is using Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you get additional device protection that includes:

- Next-generation protection

- Firewall protection

- Web content filtering

These capabilities are included in Microsoft Defender for Business, an offering that will begin rolling out to Microsoft 365 Business Premium customers, beginning March 1, 2022. 

[Learn more about Microsoft Defender for Business](../../security/defender-business/mdb-overview.md).

## 5: Protect against ransomware

Ransomware restricts access to data by encrypting files or locking computer screens. It then attempts to extort money from victims by asking for "ransom," usually in form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, in exchange for access to data.

You get ransomware protection for email hosted in Microsoft 365 and for files that are stored in OneDrive. If you have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, you get additional ransomware protection for your organization's devices.

You can protect against ransomware by creating one or more mail flow rules to block file extensions that are commonly used for ransomware, or to warn users who receive these attachments in email. A good starting point is to create two rules:

- Warn users before opening Office file attachments that include macros. Ransomware can be hidden inside macros, so we'll warn users to not open these files from people they do not know.

- Block file types that could contain ransomware or other malicious code. We'll start with a common list of executables (listed in the table below). If your organization uses any of these executable types and you expect them to be sent in email, add them to the previous rule (warn users).

To create a mail transport rule, view a [short training video](increase-threat-protection.md#protect-against-ransomware), or complete the following steps:

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104" target="_blank">Exchange admin center</a>.

2. In the **mail flow** category, select **rules**.

3. Select **+**, and then **Create a new rule**.

4. Select **** at the bottom of the dialog box to see the full set of options.

5. Apply the settings in the following table for each rule. Leave the rest of the settings at the default, unless you want to change them.

6. Select **Save**.
    
| Setting | Warn users before opening attachments of Office files | Block file types that could contain ransomware or other malicious code |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Name  <br/> |Anti-ransomware rule: warn users  <br/> |Anti-ransomware rule: block file types  <br/> |
|Apply this rule if . . .  <br/> |Any attachment . . . file extension matches . . .  <br/> |Any attachment . . . file extension matches . . .  <br/> |
|Specify words or phrases  <br/> |Add these file types:  <br/> dotm, docm, xlsm, sltm, xla, xlam, xll, pptm, potm, ppam, ppsm, sldm  <br/> |Add these file types:  <br/> ade, adp, ani, bas, bat, chm, cmd, com, cpl, crt, hlp, ht, hta, inf, ins, isp, job, js, jse, lnk, mda, mdb, mde, mdz, msc, msi, msp, mst, pcd, reg, scr, sct, shs, url, vb, vbe, vbs, wsc, wsf, wsh, exe, pif  <br/> |
|Do the following . . .  <br/> |Prepend a disclaimer  <br/> |Block the message . . . reject the message and include an explanation  <br/> |
|Provide message text  <br/> |Do not open these types of files—unless you were expecting them—because the files may contain malicious code and knowing the sender isn't a guarantee of safety.  <br/> ||
   
> [!TIP]
> You can also add the files you want to block to the anti-malware list in [Step 4: Protect against malware](#4-protect-against-malware).

- [Restore your OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15)

## 6: Stop auto-forwarding for email

Hackers who gain access to a user's mailbox can exfiltrate mail by configuring the mailbox to automatically forward email. This issue can happen even without the user's awareness. You can prevent this from happening by configuring a mail flow rule.

To create a mail transport rule:

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104" target="_blank">Exchange admin center</a>.

2. In the **mail flow** category, select **rules**.

3. Select **+**, and then **Create a new rule**.

4. Select **More options** at the bottom of the dialog box to see the full set of options.

5. Apply the settings in the following table. Leave the rest of the settings at the default, unless you want to change these.

6. Select **Save**.

|Setting|Reject Auto-Forward emails to external domains|
|---|---|
|Name|Prevent auto-forwarding of email to external domains|
|Apply this rule if ...|The sender . . . is external/internal . . . Inside the organization|
|Add condition|The recipient . . . is external/internal . . . Outside the organization|
|Add condition|The message properties . . . include the message type . . . Auto-forward|
|Do the following ...|Block the message . . . reject the message and include an explanation.|
|Provide message text|Auto-forwarding email outside this organization is prevented for security reasons.|

## 7: Use Microsoft Purview Message Encryption

Microsoft Purview Message Encryption is included with Microsoft 365. It's already set up. With Microsoft Purview Message Encryption, your organization can send and receive encrypted email messages between people inside and outside your organization. Microsoft Purview Message Encryption works with Outlook.com, Yahoo!, Gmail, and other email services. Email message encryption helps ensure that only intended recipients can view message content.

Microsoft Purview Message Encryption provides two protection options when sending mail:

- Do not forward

- Encrypt

Your organization might have configured other options that apply a label to email, such as Confidential.

### To send protected email

In Outlook for PC, select **Options** in the email, and then choose **Permissions**.

![Email message encryption in Outlook.](../../media/08e90a7e-a2d2-41a4-bae9-0a46b4ce639a.png)

In Outlook.com, select **Protect** in the email. The default protection is **Do not forward**. To change this to encrypt, select **Change Permissions** \> **Encrypt**.

![Email message encryption in Outlook.com.](../../media/329ccf50-f6b1-4fb8-b249-60b907a82b7e.png)

### To receive encrypted email

If the recipient has Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 and a Microsoft email account, they'll see an alert about the item's restricted permissions in the Reading pane. After opening the message, the recipient can view the message just like any other.

If the recipient is using another email client or email account, such as Gmail or Yahoo, they'll see a link that lets them either sign in to read the email message or request a one-time passcode to view the message in a web browser. If users aren't receiving the email, have them check their Spam or Junk folder.

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [Send, view, and reply to encrypted messages in Outlook for PC](https://support.microsoft.com/office/eaa43495-9bbb-4fca-922a-df90dee51980).

## 8. Protect your email from phishing attacks

If you've configured one or more custom domains for your Microsoft 365 environment, you can configure targeted anti-phishing protection. Anti-phishing protection, a part of Microsoft Defender for Office 365, can help protect your organization from malicious impersonation-based phishing attacks and other phishing attacks. If you haven't configured a custom domain, you do not need to do this.

We recommend that you get started with this protection by creating a policy to protect your most important users and your custom domain.

To create an anti-phishing policy in Defender for Office 365, view a [short training video](increase-threat-protection.md#protect-your-email-from-phishing-attacks), or complete the following steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>.

2. Go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-phishing** in the **Policies** section.

3. On the Anti-phishing page, select **+ Create**. A wizard launches that steps you through defining your anti-phishing policy.

4. Specify the name, description, and settings for your policy as recommended in the chart below. For more information, see [Learn about anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 options](../../security/office-365-security/set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md).

5. After you have reviewed your settings, select **Create this policy** or **Save**, as appropriate.

|Setting or option|Recommended setting|
|---|---|
|Name|Domain and most valuable campaign staff|
|Description|Ensure most important staff and our domain are not being impersonated.|
|Add users to protect|Select **+ Add a condition, The recipient is**. Type user names or enter the email address of the candidate, campaign manager, and other important staff members. You can add up to 20 internal and external addresses that you want to protect from impersonation.|
|Add domains to protect|Select **+ Add a condition, The recipient domain is**. Enter the custom domain associated with your Microsoft 365 subscription, if you defined one. You can enter more than one domain.|
|Choose actions|If email is sent by an impersonated user: select **Redirect message to another email address**, and then type the email address of the security administrator; for example, securityadmin@contoso.com. <br/> If email is sent by an impersonated domain: select **Quarantine message**.|
|Mailbox intelligence|By default, mailbox intelligence is selected when you create a new anti-phishing policy. Leave this setting **On** for best results.|
|Add trusted senders and domains|For this example, don't define any overrides.|
|Applied to|Select **The recipient domain is**. Under **Any of these**, select **Choose**. Select **+ Add**. Select the check box next to the name of the domain, for example, contoso.com, in the list, and then select **Add**. Select **Done**.|

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [Set up anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](../../security/office-365-security/configure-atp-anti-phishing-policies.md).

## 9: Protect against malicious attachments, files, and URLs

People regularly send, receive, and share attachments, such as documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and more. It's not always easy to tell whether an attachment is safe or malicious just by looking at an email message. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes Safe Attachment protection, but this protection is not turned on by default. We recommend that you create a new rule to begin using this protection. This protection extends to files in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

### Set up Safe Attachments

To create a Safe Attachments policy, view a [short training video](increase-threat-protection.md), or complete the following steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, and sign in with your admin account.

2. Go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-malware** in the **Policies** section.

3. Select **+ Create** to create a new policy.

4. Apply the settings in the following table.

5. After you have reviewed your settings, select **Create this policy** or **Save**, as appropriate.

|Setting or option|Recommended setting|
|---|---|
|Name|Block current and future emails with detected malware.|
|Description|Block current and future emails and attachments with detected malware.|
|Save attachments unknown malware response|Select **Block - Block the current and future emails and attachments with detected malware**.|
|Redirect attachment on detection|Enable redirection (select this box) <br/> Enter the admin account or a mailbox setup for quarantine. <br/> Apply the above selection if malware scanning for attachments times out or error occurs (select this box).|
|Applied to|The recipient domain is . . . select your domain.|

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [Set up anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](../../security/office-365-security/configure-atp-anti-phishing-policies.md).

### Set up Safe Links

Hackers sometimes hide malicious websites in links in email or other files. Safe Links, part of Microsoft Defender for Office 365, can help protect your organization by providing time-of-click verification of web addresses (URLs) in email messages and Office documents. Protection is defined through Safe Links policies.

Do the following to protect against attacks:

- Modify the default policy to increase protection.

- Add a new policy targeted to all recipients in your domain.

To get to Safe Links, view a [short training video](increase-threat-protection.md#protect-against-phishing-attacks-with-safe-links), or complete the following steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a>, and sign in with your admin account.

2. Go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules** \> **Threat policies** \> **Anti-malware** in the **Policies** section.

3. Select **+ Create** to create a new policy, or modify the default policy.

To modify the default policy:

1. Double-click the **Default** policy. A flyout appears. 

2. Select **Edit protection settings** at the bottom of the flyout.

3. After modifying the default policy, select **Save**.

|Setting or option|Recommended setting|
|---|---|
|Name|Safe links policy for all recipients in the domain|

|Apply real-time URL scanning for suspicious links and links that point to files|Select this box.|
|Applied to|The recipient domain is . . . select your domain.|

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [Safe Links in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](../../security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links.md).

## 10: Increase protection for your organization's devices

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is built into the Windows operating system and provides good protection against viruses and malware. However, you can increase protection for your organization's devices by onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Business, a new offering for small and medium-sized businesses like yours. With Defender for Business, your organization's devices are better protected from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats.

**Beginning March 1, 2022, [Microsoft Defender for Business](../../security/defender-business/index.yml) capabilities are being added to Microsoft 365 Business Premium**.
