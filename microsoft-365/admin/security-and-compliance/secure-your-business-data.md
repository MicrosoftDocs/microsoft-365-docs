# Top 10 ways to secure your data - Best practices for small and medium-sized businesses

**Applies to**

- Microsoft 365 Business Basic
- Microsoft 365 Business Standard
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium

Microsoft 365 for business plans include security capabilities, such as antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection. Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes more capabilities, such as device management, advanced threat protection, and information protection. This article describes steps you can take to secure your business data, and [compares capabilities across Microsoft 365 for business plans](#comparing-microsoft-365-for-business-plans).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/top-10-ways-secure-data.png" alt-text="Diagram listing top 10 ways to secure business data.":::

1. **Use multi-factor authentication**. [Multi-factor authentication](multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data. Using MFA can prevent hackers from taking over if they know your password. See [security defaults and MFA](../../business-premium/m365bp-conditional-access.md). 

2. **Protect your administrator accounts**. Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks. See [Protect your administrator accounts](../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md). 

3. **Use preset security policies**. Your subscription includes [preset security policies](../../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md) that use recommended settings for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection. See [Protect against malware and other cyberthreats](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md).

4. **Protect all devices**. Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be configured properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. See the following articles: 

   - [Help users set up MFA on their devices](https://support.microsoft.com/office/set-up-your-microsoft-365-sign-in-for-multi-factor-authentication-ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14)
   - [Protect unmanaged Windows and Mac computers](../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md) 
   - [Set up managed devices](../../business-premium/m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md) (requires Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Microsoft Defender for Business)

5. **Train everyone on email best practices**. Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. See [Protect yourself against phishing and other attacks](../../business-premium/m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md).

6. **Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing**. The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it. See the following articles: 

   - [Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration](../../business-premium/create-teams-for-collaboration.md) 
   - [Set up meetings with Microsoft Teams](../../business-premium/set-up-meetings.md) 
   - [Share files and videos in a safe environment](../../business-premium/share-files-and-videos.md) 

7. **Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders**. Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use. We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business. See [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders). 

8. **Use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices**. Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps (also referred to as Office apps) enable people to work productively and more securely across devices. Whether you're using the web or desktop version of an app, you can start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device. Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to files that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive. See [Install Office apps on all devices](../../business-premium/m365bp-install-office-apps.md). 

9. **Manage calendar sharing for your business**. You can help people in your organization share their calendars appropriately for better collaboration. You can manage what level of detail they can share, such as by limiting the details that are shared to free/busy times only. See [Manage calendar sharing](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing). 

10. **Maintain your environment**. After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan. As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings. See [Maintain your environment](../../business-premium/m365bp-maintain-environment.md).
