# Reset Windows 10 devices to their factory settings

This article applies to Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

2. In the left nav, choose **Devices** \> **Manage**.

3. On the **Manage** page, check the checkbox next to the device you want to remove data from and then, in the **Manage** drop-down choose **Factory reset**.
