# About the Microsoft 365 admin center

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

The Microsoft 365 admin center is built for IT teams as a simplified way to manage your Microsoft 365 services. The admin center provides a tailored experience based on the unique needs of your role or organization, improves efficiency for everyday tasks, and provides actionable insights that help you make data-driven decisions to deliver a better experience for your users.

The Microsoft 365 admin center is the common entry point for all Microsoft 365 admins and can be accessed at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024339). Specialist workspaces, like Security or Device management, allow for more granular control. For more information about how the admin centers will work together, see [What about the specific types of IT roles and other workspaces like Security, Device Management, or Exchange?](#what-about-the-specific-types-of-it-roles-and-other-workspaces-like-security-device-management-or-exchange) later in this article.

As new features become available in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you'll be able to opt in to the admin center and share your feedback with Microsoft so that we can continue to improve the admin experience. If you opt in, there will be no impact to your users, and you can switch back to the old admin center at any time.
[What's new in the Microsoft 365 admin center](whats-new-in-preview.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Targeted release admins will have first access to new features. New features will then roll out to all admins. This means that you may not see the admin center, or it may look different than what is described in help articles. To be among the first to see new features, see Participate in the admin center, below. 

### Turn on Targeted release

1. Sign in at [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to the navigation pane and select **Settings** \> **Organization profile**.

2. Go to the **Release preferences** card, and then select **Edit**. 
    
3. Select either **Targeted release for everyone** or **Targeted release for selected users**. If you choose Targeted release for selected users, make sure that you add your admin account (and any other admins in your org who want to participate) to the list of selected users.
    
### Admin center feedback

While in the admin center, you can give Microsoft feedback about your experience by selecting **Give feedback** right next to the **Need help?** button at the bottom of every page. Tell us what you like and what we could do better. In addition, you may get pop-up surveys from time-to-time asking about your overall impressions or a particular experience that's newly released. You can also give feedback at the end of this article by selecting **Was this information helpful?**

### Switch to the new admin center and back again

While the new admin center is in preview, you can switch back and forth between the new admin center and the old admin center by using the toggle located at the top of the admin center Home page. The new admin center is fully functional and has all the capabilities of the old admin center.

To try the new admin center, turn the toggle to <b>Try the preview</b>. The toggle will then show <b>Preview on</b>. Next time you sign in to the admin center, we'll remember your selection and sign you in to the new admin center.

To go back to using the old admin center, turn the toggle from <b>Preview on</b> to the off position. Next time you sign in to the admin center, we'll sign you in to the old admin center.

## What about the specific types of IT roles and other workspaces like Security, Device Management, or Exchange?

The Microsoft 365 admin center is the common entry point for all teams and roles managing Microsoft 365. The experience, information, and controls are tailored and customizable for each admin and role. Additionally, specialist workspaces allow for deep, granular control. These specialist workspaces include SharePoint, Teams &amp; Skype, Exchange, Security, Compliance, Device Management, and Azure Active Directory. You can find the specialist workspaces from the navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024339).
