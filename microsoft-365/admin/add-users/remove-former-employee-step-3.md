# Step 3 - Forward a former employee's email to another employee or convert to a shared mailbox

In this step, you assign the former employee's email address to another employee, or convert the user's mailbox to a shared mailbox.

## Convert former employee's mailbox to a shared mailbox

When you convert a user's mailbox to a shared mailbox, all of the existing email and calendar is retained. Only now it's in a shared mailbox where several people will be able to access it instead of one person. You can convert a shared mailbox back to a user (private) mailbox at a later date if you want.

- Creating a shared mailbox is the less expensive way to go because you won't have to pay for a license **as long as the mailbox is smaller than 50GB**. Over 50GB and you'll need to assign a license to it.
- If you convert the mailbox to a shared mailbox, all the old email will be available, too. This can take up a lot of space.
- If you set up email forwarding, only *new* emails sent to the former employee will now be sent to the current employee.

Follow these steps on how to [convert the user's mailbox to a shared mailbox](../email/convert-user-mailbox-to-shared-mailbox.md).

## Forward a former employee's email to another employee

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > If you're setting up email forwarding or a shared mailbox, at the end, don't delete the former employee's account. The account needs to be there to anchor the email forwarding or shared mailbox.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
2. Select the name of the employee that you want to block, and then select the **Mail** tab.
3. Under **Email Forwarding**, select **Manage email forwarding**.
4. Turn on **Forward all email sent to this mailbox**. In the **Forwarding address** box, type the email address of the current employee who's going to get the email.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Remember, don't delete the former employee's account.
