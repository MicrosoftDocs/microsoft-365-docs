# About admin roles

Your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription comes with a set of admin roles that you can assign to users in your organization using the Microsoft 365 admin center. Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in your organization permissions to do specific tasks in the admin centers.

The Microsoft 365 admin center lets you manage Azure AD roles and Microsoft Intune roles. However, these roles are a subset of the roles available in the Azure AD portal and the Intune admin center.

## Before you begin

Looking for the full list of detailed Azure AD role descriptions you can manage in the Microsoft 365 admin center? Check out Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory. [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles).

Looking for the full list of detailed Intune role descriptions you can manage in the Microsoft 365 admin center?  Check out [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control).

For more information on assigning roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign admin roles](assign-admin-roles.md).

## Security guidelines for assigning roles

Because admins have access to sensitive data and files, we recommend that you follow these guidelines to keep your organization's data more secure.

| Recommendation                  | Why is this important?                 |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Have 2 to 4 global admins  | Because only another global admin can reset a global admin's password, we recommend that you have at least 2 global admins in your organization in case of account lockout. But the global admin has almost unlimited access to your org's settings and most of the data, so we also recommend that you don't have more than 4 global admins because that's a security threat. |
| Assign the *least permissive* role    | Assigning the *least permissive* role means giving admins only the access they need to get the job done. For example, if you want someone to reset employee passwords you shouldn't assign the unlimited global admin role, you should assign a limited admin role, like Password admin or Helpdesk admin.  This will help keep your data secure.                 |
| Require multi-factor authentication for admins                  |    It's actually a good idea to require MFA for all of your users, but admins should definitely be required to use MFA to sign in. MFA makes users enter a second method of identification to verify they are who they say they are. Admins can have access to a lot of customer and employee data and if you require MFA, even if the admin's password gets compromised, the password is useless without the second form of identification.  <br><br>When you turn on MFA, the next time the user signs in, they'll need to provide an alternate email address and phone number for account recovery.  <br> [Set up multi-factor authentication](../security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md)          |

If you get a message in the admin center telling you that you don't have permissions to edit a setting or page, it's because you are assigned a role that doesn't have that permission.

## Commonly used Microsoft 365 admin center roles

You'll probably only need to assign the following roles in your organization. By default, we first show roles that most organizations use. If you can't find a role, go to the bottom of the list and select **Show all by Category**.

## Delegated administration for Microsoft Partners

If you're working with a Microsoft partner, you can assign them admin roles. They, in turn, can assign users in your company, or their company, admin roles. You might want them to do this, for example, if they are setting up and managing your online organization for you.
  
A partner can assign these roles:
  
- **Full administration** Privileges equivalent to a global admin, with the exception of managing multi-factor authentication through the Partner Center.

- **Limited administration** Privileges equivalent to a helpdesk admin.

Before the partner can assign these roles to users, you must add the partner as a delegated admin to your account. This process is initiated by an authorized partner. The partner sends you an email to ask you if you want to give them permission to act as a delegated admin. For instructions, see [Authorize or remove partner relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/misc/add-partner).
