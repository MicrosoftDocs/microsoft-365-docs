# About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription comes with a set of admin roles that you can assign to users in your organization using the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in your organization permissions to do specific tasks in the admin centers.

## Before you begin

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> lets you manage Azure AD roles and Microsoft Intune roles. However, these roles are a subset of the roles available in the Azure AD portal and the Intune admin center.

For the full list of detailed Azure AD role descriptions you can manage in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, check out Administrator role permissions in the [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) topic.

For the full list of detailed Intune role descriptions you can manage in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, check out [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control).

For more information on assigning roles in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, see [Assign admin roles](assign-admin-roles.md).

## Security guidelines for assigning roles

Because admins have access to sensitive data and files, we recommend that you follow these guidelines to keep your organization's data more secure.

| Recommendation                  | Why is this important?                 |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Have 2 to 4 Global Admins  | Global Admins have almost unlimited access to your organization's settings and most of its data. We recommend you limit the number of Global Admins as much as possible. A Global Admin may inadvertently lock their account and require a password reset. Either another Global Admin or a Privileged Authentication Admin can reset a Global Admin's password. Therefore, we recommend you have at least either one more Global Admin or a Privileged Authentication Admin in the event a Global Admin locks their account. |
| Assign the *least permissive* role    | Assigning the *least permissive* role means giving admins only the access they need to get the job done. For example, if you want someone to reset employee passwords you shouldn't assign the unlimited global admin role, you should assign a limited admin role, like Password admin or Helpdesk admin.                 |
| Require multi-factor authentication for admins                  |    It's actually a good idea to require MFA for all of your users, but admins should definitely be required to use MFA to sign in. MFA makes users use a second method of identification to verify their identity. Admins can have access to much of customer and employee data. If you require MFA, even if the admin's password gets compromised, the password is useless without the second method of identification.  <br><br>When you turn on MFA, the next time the user signs in, they'll need to provide an alternate email address and phone number for account recovery.  <br> [Set up multi-factor authentication](../security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md)          |

If you get a message in the admin center that you don't have permissions to edit a setting or page, it's because you're assigned a role that doesn't have that permission. Talk to another admin to assign you the correct permissions or see [Assign admin roles](assign-admin-roles.md) to assign yourself the correct role.

## Commonly used Microsoft 365 admin center roles

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097861" target="_blank">**Role assignments**</a>, and then select any role to open its detail pane. Select the **Permissions** tab to view the detailed list of what admins assigned that role have permissions to do. Select the **Assigned** or **Assigned admins** tab to add users to roles.

You'll probably only need to assign the following roles in your organization. By default, we first show roles that most organizations use. If you can't find a role, go to the bottom of the list and select **Show all by Category**. (For detailed information, including the cmdlets associated with a role, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).)

## Delegated administration for Microsoft Partners

If you're working with a Microsoft partner, you can assign them admin roles. They, in turn, can assign users in your company, or their company, admin roles. You may want to assign admin roles to partners if they're setting up and managing your online organization for you.
  
A partner can assign these roles:
  
- **Admin Agent** Privileges equivalent to a global admin, except for managing multi-factor authentication through the Partner Center.

- **Helpdesk Agent** Privileges equivalent to a helpdesk admin.

Before the partner can assign these roles to users, you must add the partner as a delegated admin to your account. The partner has to be an authorized partner. The partner sends you an email to ask you if you want to give them permission to act as a delegated admin. For instructions, see [Authorize or remove partner relationships](../misc/add-partner.md).

## Volume licensing roles

Permissions to volume licensing information in Microsoft 365 admin center are controlled by the VL Agreement Administrators in Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC), even for VL roles that predominantly use functionality in the Microsoft 365 admin center rather than VLSC.

- Some volume licensing (VL) functionality is now available in Microsoft 365 admin center in a new volume licensing blade visible only to volume licensing users only.

- Volume licensing users see no other Microsoft 365 admin center information or functionality.

- Microsoft 365 admin center Global Admins have no role in assigning VL user permissions and do not need to assign any admin permissions to VL users for them to see the volume licensing blade.

- Volume licensing users must first register on the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC), where all roles and permissions for volume licensing functions is managed.

- For more information about volume licensing in Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Frequently Asked Questions for the Volume Licensing Service Center](/licensing/vlsc-faqs-home-page) or [contact the Volume Licensing Service team](/licensing/contact-us).
