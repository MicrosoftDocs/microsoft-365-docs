## What you need to know about terminating an employee's email session

The following information explains how to remove an employee from the organization's email (Exchange):

|What you can do|How you do it|
|:-----|:-----|
|Terminate a session (such as Outlook on the web, Outlook, Exchange active sync, etc.) and force to open a new session|Reset password|
|Terminate a session and block access to future sessions (for all protocols)|Disable the account. For example, in the Exchange admin center or using PowerShell: <p>  `Set-Mailbox user@contoso.com -AccountDisabled:$true`|
|Terminate the session for a particular protocol (such as ActiveSync)|Disable the protocol. For example, in the Exchange admin center or using PowerShell: <p>  `Set-CASMailbox user@contoso.com -ActiveSyncEnabled:$false`|
|

The above operations can be done in three places:

|If you terminate the session here|How long does it take|

|In the Exchange admin center or using PowerShell.|Expected delay is approximately 30 minutes.|
|In the Azure Active Directory admin center.|Expected delay is 60 minutes.|
|In an on-premises environment.|Expected delay is 3 hours or more.|

# Step 1 - Prevent a former employee from logging in and block access to Microsoft 365 services

If you need to immediately prevent a user's sign-in access, you should reset their password. In this step, force a sign out of the user from Microsoft 365.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to be a global administrator to initiate sign-out for other administrators. For non administrator users, you can use a User Administrator or a Helpdesk Administrator user to perform this action. [Learn more about the Admin Roles](about-admin-roles.md)

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
2. Select the box next to the user's name, and then select **Reset password**.
3. Enter a new password, and then select **Reset**. (Don't send it to them.)
4. Select the user's name to go to their properties pane, and on the **Account** tab, select **Sign out of all sessions**.

Within an hour - or after they leave the current Microsoft 365 page they are on - they're prompted to sign in again. An access token is good for an hour, so the timeline depends on how much time is left on that token, and whether they navigate out of their current webpage.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the user is in Outlook on the web, just clicking around in their mailbox, they may not be kicked out immediately. As soon as they select a different tile, such as OneDrive, or refresh their browser, the sign-out is initiated.
  
To use PowerShell to sign out a user immediately, see the [Revoke-AzureADUserAllRefreshToken](/powershell/module/azuread/revoke-azureaduserallrefreshtoken) cmdlet.
