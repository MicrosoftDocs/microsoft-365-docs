# Azure Active Directory roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft 365 admin center lets you manage over 30 Azure AD roles. However, these roles are a subset of the roles available in the Azure portal. If you have a large business, there might be roles in the Azure portal that meet your organizational needs. Looking for the detailed role descriptions for Azure AD? Check out [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles).

A user who is assigned an admin role will have the same level of access to cloud services that your organization has subscribed to, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Windows PowerShell.

## Delegated administration for Microsoft Partners

If you're working with a Microsoft partner, you can assign them admin roles. They, in turn, can assign users in your company - or their company - admin roles. You might want them to do this, for example, if they are setting up and managing your online organization for you.
  
A partner can assign these roles:

- Full administration, which has privileges equivalent to a global admin, with the exception of managing multi-factor authentication through the Partner Center.

- Limited administration, which has privileges equivalent to a helpdesk admin.

Before the partner can assign these roles to users, you must add the partner as a delegated admin to your account. This process is initiated by an authorized partner. The partner sends you an email to ask you if you want to give them permission to act as a delegated admin. For instructions, see [Authorize or remove partner relationships](../misc/add-partner.md).
