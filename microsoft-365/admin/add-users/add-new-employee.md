# Add a new employee to Office 365

This article helps you onboard a new employee to Office 365 for business. We assume you're an Admin and you've already [completed Office 365 set up](../setup/setup.md), and now you have someone new joining your company.
  
You're in the right place if your new employee needs Office 365, and you're using an [Office 365 plan](https://products.office.com/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) that lets you install Office apps like Word and Excel on a computer. 
  
 **Not an admin?** [Learn your way around Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/9b7306d3-8d61-4794-bb6f-6520f65956d9.aspx) helps business and home users with Office 365 set up. 
  
 **No Office apps in your plan?** Follow the steps below, but skip the sections for installing apps. Use the [Online versions of Office](https://support.office.com/article/91a4ec74-67fe-4a84-a268-f6bdf3da1804.aspx) instead. 
  
Here's a quick overview: 
  
|**Step**|**Why do this?**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Step 1: Create an Office 365 account for the employee](#step-1-create-an-office-365-account-for-the-employee) <br/> |Each time a new employee joins your business, create an account for them so they can start using Office 365.  <br/> |
|[Step 2: Give the employee their user ID and password](#step-2-give-the-employee-their-user-id-and-password) <br/> |When you create an account, you'll get an ID and password that you can pass to your employee so they can sign in.  <br/> |
|[Step 3: Explain where to sign in](#step-3-explain-where-to-sign-in) <br/> |The sign in location is [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com) <br/> |
|[Step 4: Help your employee get started](#step-4-help-your-employee-get-started) <br/> |Let your employee know how to use OneDrive or any team sites in your organization.  <br/> |
   
## Step 1: Create an Office 365 account for the employee


For instructions, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Office 365 - Admin Help](add-users.md). When you set up your new employee, you can choose to send log-in details to the employee's personal account. This way, they'll receive an email from Microsoft Online Service Team that tells them how to log in to Office 365.
  
## Step 2: Give the employee their user ID and password


Unless you sent it to their personal email address, print out the employee's Office 365 sign in name and password, and hand it to them. Or tell them the information over the phone.
  
Because they won't yet have access to their Office 365 email, don't send the information to that email address.
  
## Step 3: Explain where to sign in 


Just like Facebook, Amazon, or Gmail, your employee signs in to use Office 365. Give them the following sign in information:
  
- Sign in at [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com).
    
- Select **Sign in**, then type the user ID and password.
    
## Step 4: Help your employee get started


Share with them the [Employee quick setup for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/69cd80a8-56b8-436f-aa1f-2d2a3cc51060) to sign in, install software, set up email, and more.
