# Add users and assign licenses at the same time

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

> [!NOTE]
> The admin center is changing. If your experience doesn't match the details presented here, see 
[About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview?view=o365-21vianet).

The people on your team each need a user account before they can sign in and access [Microsoft 365 for business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=519395). The easiest way to add user accounts is to add them one at a time in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After you do this step, your users have Microsoft 365 licenses, sign in credentials, and Microsoft 365 mailboxes.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global, License, or a User admin to add users and assign licenses. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Add users one at a time

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. Go to the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
2. Go to **Users** > **Active users**, and select **Add a user**.
3. In the **Set up the basics** pane, fill in the basic user information, and then select **Next**.
    - **Name** Fill in the first and last name, display name, and username.
    - **Domain** Choose the domain for the user's account. For example, if the user's username is Jakob, and the domain is contoso.com, they'll sign in by using jakob@contoso.com.
    - **Password settings** Choose to use the autogenerated password or to create your own strong password for the user.
    - The user must change their password after 90 days. Or you can choose to **Require this user to change their password when they first sign in**.
    - Choose whether you want to  send the password in email when the user is added.
4. In the **Assign product licenses** pane, select the location and the appropriate license for the user. If you don't have any licenses available, you can still add a user and buy additional licenses. Expand **Apps** and select or deselect apps to limit the apps the user has a license for. Select **Next**.
5. In the **Optional settings** pane, expand **Roles** to make this user an admin. Expand **Profile info** to add additional information about the user.

## Add multiple users at the same time

You can use any of the following methods to add multiple users at the same time:
  
- **Use a spreadsheet to add people in bulk.** See [Add several users at the same time](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/add-several-users-at-the-same-time).
- **Automate adding accounts and assigning licenses.** See [Create user accounts with Microsoft 365 PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/create-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell). Choose this method if you're already familiar with using Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
- **Using ActiveDirectory?** [Set up directory synchronization for Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/set-up-directory-synchronization). Use the Azure AD Connect tool to replicate Active Directory user accounts (and other Active Directory objects) in Microsoft 365. The sync only adds the user accounts. You must assign licenses to the synced users before they can use email and other Office apps.
- **Migrating from Exchange?** See [Ways to migrate multiple email accounts to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration). When you migrate multiple mailboxes to Microsoft 365 by using either cutover, staged, or a hybrid Exchange method, you automatically add users as part of the migration. The migration only adds the user accounts. You must assign licenses to the users before they can use email and other Office apps. If you don't assign a license to a user, their mailbox is disabled after a grace period of 30 days. Learn how to [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Next steps

After you add a user, you get an email notification from Microsoft. The email contains the person's user ID and password so they can sign in to Microsoft 365. Use your normal process for communicating new passwords. Share the [Employee quickstart guide](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b9700090-ce64-4046-ab92-ce8488a7bc0f) with your new users to set up things, like how to [download and install Office apps on a PC or Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/office/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658) and how to [set up Office apps and email on a mobile device](https://support.microsoft.com/office/7dabb6cb-0046-40b6-81fe-767e0b1f014f).
