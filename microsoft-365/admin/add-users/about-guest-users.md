# Guest users in Microsoft 365 admin center

Any guests you add to your Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or Azure Active Directory are also added to the **Guest users** list in the Microsoft admin center. Guests can attend meetings, view documents and chat in Teams they're invited to.
Once a user shows up in the **Guest users** list, you can remove their access there.

To view guest users, in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left nav, expand **Users**, and then choose **Guest users**.

## Add guests in Azure Active Directory

To add guests in the Azure Active Directory, see [add guest users](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

After you add a user you can also assign them to a group, or give them access to an app in your organization. Once you have added a user in the Azure AD portal, that user will also be listed on the **Guest users** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
After a user is added to the **Guest users** list, they can be [added to Groups](../create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups.md#add-guests-to-a-microsoft-365-group-from-the-admin-center) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

See [add guests in bulk](/azure/active-directory/b2b/tutorial-bulk-invite) to invite multiple guests to collaborate with your organization.


## Remove a guest

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand **Users** and then choose **Guest users**.
1. On the **Guest users** page, choose the user you want to remove and then choose **Delete a user**. 

To remove users in the Azure AD portal, see [remove a guest user and resources](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal#clean-up-resources).
