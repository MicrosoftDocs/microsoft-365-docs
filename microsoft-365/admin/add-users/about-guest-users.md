# Guest users in Microsoft 365 admin center

When you add guests to your Microsoft Teams, or SharePoint, those users are added to the Guest users list in the admin center. You can also add guest users in the Azure Active Directory so they can collaborate with your organization's users. Guest users can attend meetings, view documents and chat in Teams they are invited to.
Once a user is added to the Guest users list, you can remove their access there.

To view guest users, in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left nav, expand **Users**, and then choose **Guest users**.

## Add guest users in Azure Active Directory

To add guest users in the Azure Active Directory, see [add guest users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

When you add a user you can also assign them to a group, or give them access to an app in your organization. Once you have added a user in the Azure AD portal, that user will also be listed on the Guest users page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
After a user is added to the Guest users list, they can be [added to Groups](../create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups.md#add-guests-to-a-microsoft-365-group-from-the-admin-center) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

See [add guest users in bulk](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/tutorial-bulk-invite) to invite multiple guests to collaborate with your organization.


## Remove a guest user

To remove a guest user:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand **Users** and then choose **Guest users**.
1. On the **Guest users** page, choose the user you want to remove and then choose **Delete a user**. 

To remove users in the Azure AD portal, see [remove a guest user and resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal#clean-up-resources).
