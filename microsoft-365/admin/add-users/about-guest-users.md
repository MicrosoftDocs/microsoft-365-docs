# Guests in Microsoft 365 admin center

By default, guest access for Microsoft 365 groups is turned on for your organization. Admins can control whether to allow guest access to groups for their whole organization or for individual groups.

Any guests you add to your Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or Microsoft Entra External ID are also added to the **`Guest users`** list in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074830" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Guests can attend meetings, view documents and chat in Teams they're invited to.
Once a user shows up in the **`Guest users`** list, you can remove their access there.

To view guests, in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074830" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, in the left nav, expand **Users**, and then choose **`Guest users`**.

## Before you begin

You must be a global administrator to perform this task.

## Understanding guest accounts in Microsoft 365

Being able to easily share files and documents with the right people while preventing oversharing requires planning. The following resources provide more background to help you create a secure guest sharing environment in Microsoft 365.

In addition to Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, Microsoft 365 also supports guest access in other applications. The following Microsoft 365 products support guest access.

For apps in Microsoft 365 like Microsoft Word and Excel, guest access is controlled by the location of the output file, for example, Microsoft SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.

## Next steps: Add guests in Microsoft Entra External ID

To add guests in Microsoft Entra External ID, see [add a guest](/entra/external-id/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

After you add a user you can also assign them to a group, or give them access to an app in your organization. Once you added a user in the Microsoft Entra admin center, that user is also listed on the **Guest users** page in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074830" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

See [add guests in bulk](/entra/external-id/tutorial-bulk-invite) to invite multiple guests to collaborate with your organization.
