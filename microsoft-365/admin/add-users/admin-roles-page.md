# Get started with the Microsoft 365 admin roles page

On the Roles page, you can give users permissions to do tasks in the admin centers. This helps your organization spread tasks to the appropriate people and helps keep your data secure.

### Global admin

Assign the global admin role to users who need global access to most management features and data across Microsoft online services.

They can also open and manage support requests to Microsoft support. The person who signed up for Microsoft online services automatically becomes a global admin.
