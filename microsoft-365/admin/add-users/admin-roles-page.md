# Get started with the Microsoft 365 admin roles page

On the Roles page, you can give users permissions to do tasks in the admin centers. This helps your organization spread tasks to the appropriate people and helps keep your data secure.

This isn't an exhaustive list of all the permissions that these roles have. Select the **Learn more** link for more information about each role.

### Exchange admin

### Global admin

Assign the global admin role to users who need global access to most management features and data across Microsoft online services. Giving too many users global access is a security risk and we recommend that you have between 2 and 4 Global admins. Only global admins can reset passwords for all user and add and manage domains. They can also open and manage support requests to Microsoft support. The person who signed up for Microsoft online services automatically becomes a global admin.
