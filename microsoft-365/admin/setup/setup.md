2. Choose the plan you want to sign up for, such as **Office 365 Business Premium**.

    When the signup process is complete, you'll be directed to the admin center, where you'll follow a wizard to install Office apps, add your domain, add users, and assign licenses. After you complete the initial setup, you can use the **Setup** page in the admin center to continue setting up and configuring the services that come with your subscriptions.

    For more information about the Office 365 setup wizard and the admin center **Setup** page, see [Difference between the Office 365 setup wizard and the Setup page](o365-setup-wizard-and-setup-page.md).

### 2. Set up Outlook for email

### 3. Import email

If you were using Outlook with another email account, you can import your previous email, calendar, and contacts into your new Office 365 account.
  
1. **Export your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export**.

    Select **Export to a File** and then follow the steps to export your Outlook Data File (.pst) and any subfolders.

2. **Import your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export** again.

1. From the admin center, go to **Resources**, and then select **Public website**.

2. Select **Learn more** under one of the options, and then sign up with a website partner and use their tools to set up and design your site.

### Get ready for Office 365

- **First, verify that you qualify for an education subscription** Follow the steps to [Verify your Office 365 domain to prove ownership, nonprofit or education status, or to activate Yammer](https://support.office.com/article/87d1844e-aa47-4dc0-a61b-1b773fd4e590), so Office 365 can give you the go-ahead for using an education plan. Then you can get Office 365 set up for your school by following the guidance in this article.

- **Get help?** If you want help with a more advanced deployment, **[FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/microsoft-365/office-365)** is a great place to start. You can also [find a partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=391089) to help you.

To start the wizard, select **Go to setup**.

For a walkthrough of what happens when you run the wizard, see [Using the Office 365 setup wizard](https://support.office.com/article/3c62a3b7-1680-41ca-943c-0ff01566bace.aspx).
  
If you want to synchronize your users from an on-premises directory or use Single Sign-On, **do not use the setup wizard to add users**. Instead, read this guide to understand your options: [Understanding Office 365 identity and Azure Active Directory](https://support.office.com/article/06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9). You'll either set up:
  
- [Understanding Office 365 identity and Azure Active Directory](https://support.office.com/article/06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9#BK_Sync). Synchronizes with an on-premises directory. You manage your users on-premises. You can also synchronize passwords so that the users have the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but they will have to sign in again to use Office 365.

- [Understanding Office 365 identity and Azure Active Directory](https://support.office.com/article/06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9#BK_Federated). Synchronizes with an on-premises directory. You manage your users on-premises. Users can have the same password on-premises and in the cloud, and they do not have to sign in again to use Office 365. This is often referred to as single sign-on.

### 2. Set up services

Set up email, file sharing, instant messaging, and other Office 365 services and applications: [Configure Office 365 Enterprise services and applications](https://support.office.com/article/7cec08a5-97fd-4761-b23b-ef3d66519e30).
  
In this step, you can install Office 365 on up to 5 PCs and laptops per person.
  
### 3. Migrate data

Once the services are configured, you can start migrating data, like email and files: [Migrate your organization data to Office 365 Enterprise](https://support.office.com/article/e2fdfc8d-547e-4419-8628-2738ed4e0f46).
