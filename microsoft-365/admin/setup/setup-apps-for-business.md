 When the sign-up process is complete, you'll be directed to the admin center, where you can add users, and assign licenses. 

## Install Office

Once you've created accounts for other people in your business, you and your team members will be able to install the full desktop version of Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.). Each person can install Office on up to 5 PCs or Macs.

## Store files online

Microsoft makes online file storage easy. To learn which storage locations are best for your business, see [Where you can store files in Office 365](../../business-video/store-files.md).
  
Everyone gets a **OneDrive** cloud storage location automatically when you create Microsoft accounts for them. With OneDrive, you can access files across your computers, phones, and tablets.
  
1. On your computer, use File Explorer to open OneDrive. Or, from [Office 365](https://www.office.com), open **OneDrive** from the app launcher.

2. View and upload personal files, or share documents or folders by selecting **Share** and then either inviting others to view the documents or sending them a link. To learn more, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#OS_Type=OneDrive_-_Business).
