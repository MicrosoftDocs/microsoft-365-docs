## Store files online

Microsoft makes online file storage easy. To learn which storage locations are best for your business, see [Where you can store files in Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e).
  
Everyone gets a **OneDrive** cloud storage location automatically when you create Microsoft accounts for them. With OneDrive, you can access files across your computers, phones, and tablets.
  
1. On your computer, use File Explorer to open OneDrive. Or, from [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft365.com), open **OneDrive** from the app launcher.

2. View and upload personal files, or share documents or folders by selecting **Share** and then either inviting others to view the documents or sending them a link. To learn more, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#OS_Type=OneDrive_-_Business).

## Add a custom domain

You can also add a custom domain, like *contoso.com*, to your account to personalize the emails if you haven't already done so. For more information, see [add a domain](add-domain.md).
