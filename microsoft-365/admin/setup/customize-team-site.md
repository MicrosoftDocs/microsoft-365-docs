# Customize your SharePoint team site for file storage and sharing

If you have a small business with a few employees, one of the best ways to set up and facilitate file sharing and online collaboration is to use OneDrive and a SharePoint team site together. We recommend creating a team site that's connected to a Microsoft 365 Group. If you want to use chat, you can create a team site by creating a team in Microsoft Teams. For more info about Teams, see [Video: Get started with Microsoft Teams?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b98d533f-118e-4bae-bf44-3df2470c2b12). If you don't want to use Teams, you can create a team site from the SharePoint start page.

This article provides some ideas and links to help you customize, organize, and manage your team site.
  
 
## Customize your team site

To give more visibility to data on a team site, you can customize your site to reflect your professional style and brand or to help you and your employees get to the information you need quickly. For example, you might use a SharePoint theme to change the color, add a custom header, or add links to employee OneDrive folders, Documents, Contacts, Tasks, Calendars, and a OneNote notebook where you store meeting agendas and notes.
  
- For information on customizing the look and feel of your team site, see [Change the look of your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818).
  
- To improve navigation on your team site, see [Customize the navigation on your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca).
  
- To improve the discoverability of a team site, add it as a featured link on the SharePoint start page. For more information, see [Add featured links to the SharePoint start page](/sharepoint/change-links-list-on-sharepoint-home-page).
  
- To add an image to a SharePoint page, see [Add a picture or image file to a SharePoint page](https://support.microsoft.com/office/4a9b0e98-c89a-4a41-8adb-b7750dccca16).
  
- To add pages to your team site, see [Create and use modern pages on a SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec).
  
- To learn about team site settings, see [Change a SharePoint site's title, description, logo, and site information settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/8376034D-D0C7-446E-9178-6AB51C58DF42).
  
## Work with document libraries

A team site includes a document library that you can start using immediately for file storage and document management.

- To begin uploading documents, see [Upload a folder or files to a document library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/eb18fcba-c953-4d45-8d90-8da66edeacdb).
   
- To learn how to edit, delete, check out files, and more, see [Work with files in a document library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/a9d89171-1673-4892-9dd2-1ca52037dea2).
  
- To learn how to create views of libraries to surface specific data, see [Create a custom view of a document library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/8f6b08e0-a9a0-4232-9b9b-b374a2ad3da7).
  
## Work with lists to organize data

SharePoint includes many templates for lists that you can add to your team site, such as a list of links, a calendar, contacts, or tasks.
  
- To learn how to create a list, see [Create a list in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0D397414-D95F-41EB-ADDD-5E6EFF41B083#ID0EAAGAAA=Online).
  
- To learn how to expand your lists by adding more columns, see [Create a column in a SharePoint list or library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2b0361ae-1bd3-41a3-8329-269e5f81cfa2).
  
- If you store large amounts of data in a list, see [Manage large lists and libraries in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/B8588DAE-9387-48C2-9248-C24122F07C59).
  
- To add a shared calendar to your site, watch [Video: Create a shared calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/61b96006-70e2-4535-a34f-ee4fc772f798).

## Organize sites into hubs

Your team site shares almost everything with all members of the group associated with the site. If you want a separate site for specific customers, you can create additional team sites and manage them by using SharePoint hub sites. 
  
- To learn how to add and associate sites by using hub sites, see [What is a SharePoint hub site?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/fe26ae84-14b7-45b6-a6d1-948b3966427f).
  
- To learn how to build a hub site, see [Create a hub site in SharePoint](/sharepoint/create-hub-site).
  
- To learn how to add sites to a hub site, see [Associate a SharePoint site with a hub site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ae0009fd-af04-4d3d-917d-88edb43efc05).
  
## Share files with the team

Setting up file storage and document management is a good start, but sharing information with your team and external clients is also important.
  
- To learn how to share files and folders with your team, see [Share SharePoint files or folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c).
  
- To learn about sharing data outside your team, see [Overview of external sharing in SharePoint and OneDrive](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).
  
## Manage users and Microsoft 365 Groups

As you manage your team site, you might need to add or remove users.
  
- To learn about groups and managing permissions, see [Understand groups and permissions on a SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/258e5f33-1b5a-4766-a503-d86655cf950d). 
  
- To learn how to add or remove users from a Microsoft 365 Group, see [Add or remove members from Microsoft 365 Groups](../create-groups/add-or-remove-members-from-groups.md).
  
- To learn how to manage access requests, see [Set up and manage access requests](https://support.microsoft.com/office/94B26E0B-2822-49D4-929A-8455698654B3).
  
## Next steps

To edit files that are stored on your team site from your tablet or phone, you must set up Microsoft 365 apps on your devices. If you don't install the Microsoft 365 apps for your tablet or phone, you'll be able to view the files but not edit them.
