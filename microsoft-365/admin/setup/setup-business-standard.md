# Set up Microsoft 365 Business Standard with a new or existing domain

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

When you purchase Microsoft 365 Business Standard, you have the option of adding a domain you own, or buying one. Check out [Sign up for a Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription](../simplified-signup/signup-business-standard.md).

In this article, we'll walk you through the steps of adding an existing domain you already own or buying a new one. If you purchased a new domain when you signed up, your domain is all set up and you can move to [Add users and assign licenses](#add-users-and-assign-licenses).

> [!Tip]
> If you have a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, please see [Set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/m365-business-premium-setup.md).

## Before you begin

To add, modify or remove domains you must be a global administrator. For more info, see [About admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person who signs up for Microsoft 365 for business (usually the business owner) automatically becomes the technical administrator of the organization. You can add other people as admins if you want help managing your Microsoft 365 services. Check out [Assign admin roles](../add-users/assign-admin-roles.md) for more info.

## Steps: Add an existing domain to your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription

1. From the **How you'll sign in** page on the Microsoft 365 Business Standard sign up, choose **Create a new business email account (advanced)**.

2. On the **Install your Microsoft 365 apps** page, you can optionally install the apps on your own computer.

3. In the **Add domain** step, enter the domain name you want to use (like contoso.com).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you purchased a domain during the sign-up, you will not see **Add a domain** step here. Go to [Add users](#add-users-and-assign-licenses) instead.

4. Follow the steps to [Add DNS records to connect your domain](../get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider.md) that verifies you own the domain. If you know your domain host, see also [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain).

    If your hosting provider is GoDaddy or another host enabled with [domain connect](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/domain-connect), the process is easy and you'll be automatically asked to sign in and let Microsoft authenticate on your behalf.

## Add users and assign licenses

You can add users now, but you can also [add users later](../add-users/add-users.md) in the admin center.

Any users you add get automatically assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Standard license.

1. If your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription has existing users you get an option to assign licenses to them now. Go ahead and add licenses to them as well.

2. After you've added the users, you'll also get an option to share credentials with the new users you added. You can choose to print them out, email them, or download them.

## Connect your domain
  
To set up services, you have to update records at your DNS host or domain registrar.
  
1. The setup wizard typically detects your registrar and gives you a link to step-by-step instructions for updating your NS records at the registrar website. If it doesn't, [Change nameservers to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](../get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

    - If you have existing DNS records, for example an existing web site, but your DNS host is enabled for [domain connect](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/domain-connect), choose **Add records for me**. On the **Choose your online services** page, accept all the defaults, and choose **Next**, and choose **Authorize** on your DNS host's page.
    - If you have existing DNS records with other DNS hosts (not enabled for domain connect), you'll want to manage your own DNS records to make sure the existing services stay connected. See [domain basics](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/dns-basics) for more info.

2. Follow the steps in the wizard and email and other services will be set up for you.

    When the signup process is complete, you'll be directed to the admin center, where you'll follow a wizard to install Microsoft 365 apps, add your domain, add users, and assign licenses. After you complete the initial setup, you can use the **Setup** page in the admin center to continue setting up and configuring the services that come with your subscriptions.

    For more information about the setup wizard and the admin center **Setup** page, see [Difference between the setup wizard and the Setup page](o365-setup-wizard-and-setup-page.md).

1. From the admin center, go to **Resources**, and then select **Public website**.

2. Select **Learn more** under one of the options, and then sign up with a website partner and use their tools to set up and design your site.
