# Set up Microsoft Business Standard



## Add your domain to personalize sign-in

When you purchase Microsoft 365 Business Standard, you have the option of using a domain you own, or buying one during the sign-up.

- If you purchased a new domain when you signed up, your domain is all set up and you can move to [Add users and assign licenses](#add-users-and-assign-licenses).

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) by using your global admin credentials. 

2. Choose **Go to setup** to start the wizard.

3. On the **Install your Office apps** page, you can optionally install the apps on your own computer.
    
4. In the **Add domain** step, enter the domain name you want to use (like contoso.com).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you purchased a domain during the sign-up, you will not see **Add a domain** step here. Go to [Add users](#add-users-and-assign-licenses) instead.

    
4. Follow the steps in the wizard to [Create DNS records at any DNS hosting provider for Office 365](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider) that verifies you own the domain. If you know your domain host, see also [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain).

    If your hosting provider is GoDaddy or another host enabled with [domain connect](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/domain-connect), the process is easy and you'll be automatically asked to sign in and let Microsoft authenticate on your behalf.

## Add users and assign licenses

You can add users in the wizard, but you can also [add users later](../add-users/add-users.md) in the admin center. Additionally, if you have a local domain controller, you can add users with [Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-express).

## Add users in the wizard

Any users you add in the wizard get automatically assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Standard license.

1. If your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription has existing users (for example, if you used Azure AD Connect), you get an option to assign licenses to them now. Go ahead and add licenses to them as well.

2. After you've added the users, you'll also get an option to share credentials with the new users you added. You can choose to print them out, email them, or download them.

## Connect your domain

> [!NOTE]
> If you chose to use the .onmicrosoft domain, or used Azure AD Connect to set up users, you will not see this step.
  
To set up services, you have to update some records at your DNS host or domain registrar.
  
1. The setup wizard typically detects your registrar and gives you a link to step-by-step instructions for updating your NS records at the registrar website. If it doesn't, [Change nameservers to set up Office 365 with any domain registrar](../get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md). 

    - If you have existing DNS records, for example an existing web site, but your DNS host is enabled for [domain connect](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/domain-connect), choose **Add records for me**. On the **Choose your online services** page, accept all the defaults, and choose **Next**, and choose **Authorize** on your DNS host's page.
    - If you have existing DNS records with other DNS hosts (not enabled for domain connect), you'll want to manage your own DNS records to make sure the existing services stay connected. See [domain basics](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/dns-basics) for more info.

2. Follow the steps in the wizard and email and other services will be set up for you.

    When the signup process is complete, you'll be directed to the admin center, where you'll follow a wizard to install Office apps, add your domain, add users, and assign licenses. After you complete the initial setup, you can use the **Setup** page in the admin center to continue setting up and configuring the services that come with your subscriptions.

    For more information about the setup wizard and the admin center **Setup** page, see [Difference between the setup wizard and the Setup page](o365-setup-wizard-and-setup-page.md).

## Finish setting up

1. **Export your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export**.

    Select **Export to a File** and then follow the steps to export your Outlook Data File (.pst) and any subfolders.

2. **Import your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export** again.

You can also use Exchange admin center to import everyone's email. For more information, see [migrate multiple email accounts](/Exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration).
  
### Use a public website

Microsoft 365 doesn't include a public website for your business. If you want to set one up, consider using a Microsoft partner, such as GoDaddy or WIX.
  
1. From the admin center, go to **Resources**, and then select **Public website**.

2. Select **Learn more** under one of the options, and then sign up with a website partner and use their tools to set up and design your site.
