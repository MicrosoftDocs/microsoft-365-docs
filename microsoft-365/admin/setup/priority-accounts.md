# Manage and monitor priority accounts

As the admin of a Microsoft 365 organization, you can now monitor failed or delayed email messages sent to your users who have a high business impact, like your CEO. You can enable this by adding users to your priority accounts list. Priority accounts are accounts that are essential to running your organization. Add executives, leaders, managers or other users who have access to sensitive or high priority information.
