# Create organization-wide signatures and disclaimers

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

 You can manage email signatures by adding an email signature, legal disclaimer, or disclosure statement to the email messages that enter or leave your organization. You can set it up to apply to all incoming and outgoing messages as shown below. Or you can apply it to certain messages like those containing specific words or text patterns.

## Create a signature that applies to all messages

## Limitations of organization wide signatures

You can't do the following when managing email signatures in Microsoft 365:
  
- Insert the signature directly under the latest email reply or forward
    
- Display server-side email signatures in users' Sent Items folders
    
- Embed images in email signatures
    
- Skip lines which contain variables that couldn't be updated (e.g. because the value wasn't provided for a user)
    
To gain these and other capabilities to manage email signatures, use a third-party tool. Please do an internet search for **email signature software**. A number of these providers are Microsoft Gold Partners and their software provides these capabilities.
