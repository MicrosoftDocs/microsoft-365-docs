After signing up for Microsoft 365, you might still have email going to an old account; for example, if you used a Gmail or Outlook account for work. You can continue to use both the new and old accounts, or you can import the data from the old account into your new one.

## See other email accounts in Outlook

Just want to see your email from another provider (like Gmail, Yahoo, or Live.com) in Outlook? No need to import or migrate. You can set up Outlook or Outlook Web App so you can access your other accounts from the same place as your Microsoft 365 mailbox and send, receive, and read email sent to those accounts.
  
### Outlook (desktop)

Add an account, such as your private Gmail account, to Outlook.
  
- Open Outlook, then go to **File** \> **Add account**.
