## See other email accounts in Outlook

Just want to see your email from another provider (like Gmail, Yahoo, or Live.com) in Outlook? No need to import or migrate. You can set up Outlook or Outlook Web App so you can access your other accounts from the same place as your Office 365 mailbox and send, receive, and read email sent to those accounts.
  
### Outlook (desktop)

Add an account, such as your private Gmail account, to Outlook.
  
- Open Outlook, then go to **File** \> **Add account**.
