# Create distribution groups in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Use distribution lists (sometimes called distribution groups) when you want to send email to group of people without having to type each individual recipient's name. Distribution lists can be organized by a particular discussion subject (such as "Marketing") or by users who share common work that requires them to communicate frequently. They also provide a way for you to automatically forward email to multiple email addresses.
