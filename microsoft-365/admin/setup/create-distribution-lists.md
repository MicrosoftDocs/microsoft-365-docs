# Create distribution groups in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).
  
Used when you want to send email to group of people without having to type each individual recipient's name, distribution groups (distribution lists) are organized by a particular discussion subject (such as "Marketing") or by users who share common work that requires them to communicate frequently. They also provide a way for you to automatically forward email to multiple email addresses.

Distribution groups are sometimes called distribution lists.

3. On the **Choose a group type** field, choose **Distribution**, and then choose **Next**.
  
4. Enter a name, description, and email alias for your new group, and choose whether you want people outside your organization to send email to the group.
