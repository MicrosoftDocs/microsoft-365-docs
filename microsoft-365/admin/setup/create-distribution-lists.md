# Create distribution groups in the Microsoft 365 admin center
  
Used when you want to send email to group of people without having to type each individual recipient's name, distribution groups (distribution lists) are organized by a particular discussion subject (such as "Marketing") or by users who share common work that requires them to communicate frequently. They also provide a way for you to automatically forward email to multiple email addresses.

Distribution groups are sometimes called distribution lists.
