    questions:
      - question: How do I complete the purchase? 
          
        answer: You will use an online purchase experience in the Microsoft 365 admin center. During this purchase experience, you'll need to agree to the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) if you don't already have one. There are also supplemental terms for the Early Access Program. You may work with your account team to review these documents in advance.

You will have 21 days to complete the purchase. If you need to complete an internal PO or approval process, you can view the total price including any applicable taxes based on your billing account, and then come back and complete the purchase within the 21-day period. You will receive your invoice on the 5th day of the month following your purchase. The invoice can be viewed in the Microsoft 365 admin center and can be paid by wire transfer. You can find your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center by going to **Billing** > **Bills & payments**.

      - question: Can I cancel my organization's participation in the Early Access Program? If yes, am I eligible for refund?

      - question: What is the Microsoft Customer Agreement? 
         
        answer: The Microsoft Customer Agreement provides a consistent and simplified purchasing experience. To learn more, see [Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/how-to-buy/microsoft-customer-agreement?rtc=1).
