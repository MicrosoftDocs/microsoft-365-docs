# Restore a deleted Microsoft 365 group

If you've deleted a group, it will be retained for 30 days by default. This 30-day period is considered a "soft-delete" because you can still restore the group. After 30 days, the group and its associated contents are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.

When a group is restored, the following content is restored:
  
- Azure Active Directory (AD) Microsoft 365 Groups object, properties, and members.
    
- Group's e-mail addresses.
    
- Exchange Online shared Inbox and calendar.
    
- SharePoint Online team site and files.
    
- OneNote notebook
    
- Planner
    
- Teams

- Viva Engage group and group content (If the Microsoft 365 group was created from Viva Engage)

- Power BI [Classic workspace](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-workspaces)

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes restoring only Microsoft 365 groups. All other groups cannot be restored once deleted.

## Restore a group

# [Outlook](#tab/outlook)

If you are the owner of a Microsoft 365 group, you can restore the group yourself in Outlook on the web by following these steps:

1. On the [deleted groups page](https://outlook.office.com/people/group/deleted), select the **Manage groups** option under the **Groups** node, and then choose **Deleted**.

2. Click on the **Restore** tab next to the group you want to restore.

If the deleted group doesn't appear here, contact an administrator.

# [Admin center](#tab/admin-center)

If you are a global administrator or a groups administrator, you can restore a deleted group in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. Go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Expand **Groups**, and then click **Deleted groups**.
3. Select the group that you want to restore, and then click **Restore group**.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, it may take as long as 24 hours for the group and all of its data to be restored.
