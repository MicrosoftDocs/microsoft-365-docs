## Send copies of conversations to group members' inboxes
  
When you use the admin center to create a group, by default users  do not get copies of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their inboxes. They'll need to go to the group to see conversations and meetings. You can change this setting in the admin center.

When you turn this setting on, group members will get a copy of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their Outlook Inbox. They can read and delete this copy of the email and not affect anyone else. In the Group inbox, a copy of the email still exists.

Group members can opt out of receiving these emails by choosing to stop following the group in Outlook.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. In the admin center, expand **Groups**, and then click **Groups**.

2. Click the name of the group you want to manage to open the settings pane.

3. On the **Settings** tab, select **Send copies of group conversations and events to group members** if you want members to receive copies of group messages and calendar items in their own inbox.

4. Select **Save**.
