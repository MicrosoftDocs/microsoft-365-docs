# Manage guest access in Microsoft 365 groups

By default, guest access for Microsoft 365 groups is turned on for your organization. Admins can control whether to allow guest access to groups for their whole organization or for individual groups.

When it's turned on, group members can invite guest users to a Microsoft 365 group through Outlook on Web. Invitations are sent to the group owner for approval.

Once approved, the guest user is added to the directory and the group.

> [!Note]
> Yammer Enterprise networks that are in Native Mode or the [EU Geo](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2107357) do not support network guests.
> Microsoft 365 Connected Yammer groups do not currently support guest access, but you can create non-connected, external groups in your Yammer network. See [Create and manage external groups in Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/work-with-external-users/create-and-manage-external-groups) for instructions.

Guest access in groups is often used as part of a broader scenario that includes SharePoint or Teams. These services have their own guest sharing settings. For complete instructions for setting up guest sharing across groups, SharePoint, and Teams, see:

- [Collaborate with guests in a site](../../solutions/collaborate-in-site.md)
- [Collaborate with guests in a team](../../solutions/collaborate-as-team.md)

## Manage groups guest access

If you want to enable or disable guest access in groups, you can do so in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In the admin center, go to **Show all** \> **Settings** \> **Org settings** and on the **Services** tab, select **Microsoft 365 groups**.
  
2. On the **Microsoft 365 Groups** page, choose whether you want to let people outside your organization access group resources or let group owners add people outside your organization to groups.

## Add guests to a Microsoft 365 group from the admin center

If the guest already exists in your directory, you can add them to your groups from the Microsoft 365 admin center.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Groups** > **Groups** page.
  
2. Click the group you want to add the guest to, and select **View all and manage members** on the **Members** tab. 
  
4. Select **Add members**, and choose the name of the guest you want to add.
    
5. Select **Save**.

If you want to add a guest to the directory directly, you can [Add Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration users in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/add-users-administrator).

If you want to edit any of a guest's information, you can [Add or update a user's profile information using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal).
  
## Block guest users from a specific group

If you want to allow guest access to most groups, but have some where you want to prevent guest access, you can block guest access for individual groups by using Microsoft PowerShell.

You must use the preview version of [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) (module name **AzureADPreview**) to change the group-level guest access setting:

- If you haven't installed any version of the Azure AD PowerShell module before, see [Installing the Azure AD Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0-preview#installing-the-azure-ad-module) and follow the instructions to install the public preview release.

- If you have the 2.0 general availability version of the Azure AD PowerShell module (AzureAD) installed, you must uninstall it by running `Uninstall-Module AzureAD` in your PowerShell session, and then install the preview version by running `Install-Module AzureADPreview`.

- If you have already installed the preview version, run `Install-Module AzureADPreview` to make sure it's the latest version of this module.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have global admin rights to run these commands. 

Run the following script, changing */<GroupName/>* to the name of the group where you want to block guest access.

```PowerShell
$GroupName = "<GroupName>"

Connect-AzureAD

$template = Get-AzureADDirectorySettingTemplate | ? {$_.displayname -eq "group.unified.guest"}
$settingsCopy = $template.CreateDirectorySetting()
$settingsCopy["AllowToAddGuests"]=$False
$groupID= (Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString $GroupName).ObjectId
New-AzureADObjectSetting -TargetType Groups -TargetObjectId $groupID -DirectorySetting $settingsCopy
```

To verify your settings, run this command:

```PowerShell
Get-AzureADObjectSetting -TargetObjectId $groupID -TargetType Groups | fl Values
```

The verification looks like this:

## Allow or block guest access based on their domain

You can allow or block guest users who are using a specific domain. For example, if your business (Contoso) has a partnership with another business (Fabrikam), you can add Fabrikam to your Allow list so your users can add those guests to their groups.

For more information, see [Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list).

## Add guests to the global address list

By default, guests aren't visible in the Exchange Global Address List. Use the steps listed below to make a guest visible in the global address list. Be sure the guest is visible in the Exchange Online admin center. New guests may take a short time to appear there after they're added.

Find the guest user's ObjectID by running:

```PowerShell
Get-AzureADUser -Filter "userType eq 'Guest'"
```

Then run the following using the appropriate values for ObjectID, GivenName, Surname, DisplayName, and TelephoneNumber.

```PowerShell
Set-AzureADUser -ObjectId cfcbd1a0-ed18-4210-9b9d-cf0ba93cf6b2 -ShowInAddressList $true -GivenName 'Megan' -Surname 'Bowen' -DisplayName 'Megan Bowen' -TelephoneNumber '555-555-5555'
```
