# Add or remove members from Microsoft 365 groups using the admin center

In Microsoft 365, group members typically create their own groups, add themselves to groups they want to join, or are invited by group owners. If group ownership changes, or if you determine that a member should be added or removed, as the admin you can also make that change. Only a global administrator, Exchange administrator, Groups administrator, or user administrator can make these changes. [What is a Microsoft 365 group?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2)

> [!TIP]
> If you're not an admin, you can [add or remove members using Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3b650f4a-5c9b-4f94-a1bb-0cca4b1091de).
