# Create a group in the Microsoft 365 admin center
  
While users can create an Office 365 group from Outlook or other apps, as an admin, you may need to create or delete groups, add or remove members, and customize how they work. The Microsoft 365 admin center is the place to do this. 

> [!TIP]
> Office 365 connected Yammer groups must be created in Yammer, but can be managed in the Microsoft 365 admin center like other Office 365 groups. To learn more, see [Yammer and Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/d8c239dc-a48b-47ab-b85e-6b4b8191a869.aspx). 

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not using the new Microsoft 365 admin center, you can turn it on by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page.

## Who can delete email from the Group Inbox?

The Group owner can delete any emails from the Group Inbox, regardless of whether they were the initial author.
  
A member can delete an email conversation from the Group Inbox if they initiated it, and only using Outlook on the web (right-click the email, then choose **Delete**). They can't do it from the Outlook app (Outlook 2016).
  
When an email is deleted from the group mailbox, it is not deleted from any of the group members' personal mailboxes.

## Next step: manage your group

After creating a new group and adding members, you can further configure your group, such as editing the group name or description, changing owners or members, and specifying whether external senders can email the group and whether to send copies of group conversations to members. See [Manage an Office 365 group](manage-groups.md).
