# Communication insights score – People experiences

Adoption Score supports the journey to digital transformation with insights about how your organization uses Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support it. Your organization’s score reflects people and technology experience measurements and can be compared to benchmarks from organizations similar in size to yours. The communication category is part of the people experiences measures. To learn more, check out the [Adoption Score overview](adoption-score.md) and read [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

## Prerequisites

To get started with Communication insights, people in your organization need to be licensed for:

- Microsoft Teams
- Viva Engage
- Exchange Online

For more information, see [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).

After people have been active in the above products at least once in the last 28 days, you will start to see the insights.

## Why your organization’s Communication score matters

Microsoft understands that people have different communication needs. To get a quick response to a question, you might choose to send an instant message. If you want to send status updates to your leadership, you may choose an email message. To reach a broader audience, you may choose to post a community message. Microsoft 365 enables this flexibility in communication modes to fit everyone's needs. Research shows that using real-time communication tools creates a more unified organization and builds morale, regardless of location.

## How we calculate the communication score

For Communication, we provide a primary insight, which contains the key metrics associated with communication in your organization, combined with a scoring framework for using these metrics to calculate your organization's score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft 365 provides people the flexibility to fit everyone's communication style by offering multiple modes. The primary insight provides a measure of people in your org that are using multiple modes to communicate.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/primaryinsight.png" alt-text="Primary insight to communications modes.":::

1. **Header:** Provides the key metric of people using more than one communication mode, namely:

   - Sending emails through Exchange
   - Sending messages through Teams
   - Posting on communities in Viva Engage

   This key metric is shown as a percentage of all people who are using two or more of Exchange, Teams, or Viva Engage.

2. **Body:** Provides more information on how flexibility in the modes of communication is valuable to people in your org.

3. **Visualization of current state:**

   - Horizontal bar where the blue portion represents the percentage expressed in the header
   - Highlights the (numerator/denominator) used for computing the percentage expressed in the header:
     - **Numerator**: # of people using more than one communication mode in the last 28 days
     - **Denominator**: # of people marked as enabled for more than one communication product in the last 28 days
   - **Peer Benchmark** value of the key metric is also shown as a percentage

4. **View communication resources:** Clicking here would enlist all the support content in the form of videos/articles related to Communication. From these you can navigate to the custom playlist for Communication and subsequently, for all Adoption Score categories.

#### Trend visualization of primary insight

 This chart provides the trend of numerator of the key metric in the primary insight – that is, the number of people in your org using more than one communication mode over the last 180 days. Here that the daily value is an aggregate of the number of people who use multiple forms of communication over the last 28 days.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/trend-communication.png" alt-text="Chart that shows number of people who use more than one mode to communicate vs. time.":::

### Scoring model

The communication score for your organization measures at an aggregate (organization) level whether people are consistently communicating using multiple modes among email, chat, and community posts over a 28-day window.

Scores are not provided at the individual user level.

## Explore how your organization communicates

We also provide you with information that helps you gain visibility into how your organization communicates. These additional metrics don't directly influence your Adoption Score, but can help you create an action plan as a part of your digital transformation.
