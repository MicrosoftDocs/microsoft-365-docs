# Mobility insights score – People experiences

Adoption Score provides insights into your organization's digital transformation journey through its use of Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support it. Your organization's score reflects people and technology experience measurements and can be compared to benchmarks from organizations similar to yours. The mobility category is part of the people experiences measures. To learn more, check out the [Adoption Score overview](adoption-score.md) and read [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

## Prerequisites

To get started with Mobility insights, people in your organization need to be licensed for:

- Microsoft Teams
- Exchange Online
- Word
- Excel
- PowerPoint
- OneNote

For more information, see [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).

After people have been active in the above products at least once in the last 28 days, you will start to see the insights.

## Why your organization&#39;s mobility score matters

A fundamental pillar of organizational productivity is how well people are able to work flexibly from wherever they are. With Microsoft 365, people can stay connected with Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage. People can also seamlessly collaborate on content by using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote from any location, and platforms.

## How we calculate the score

We provide a primary insight in the experience that contains the key metrics for this category. Then, a scoring framework detailed below is used for these metrics to calculate your organization's score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft 365 lets people work flexibly across apps, including Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, Viva Engage, and Skype for Business. People can also work from anywhere by using a seamless experience across desktop, web, and mobile platforms. The primary insight looks at the products that are enabled for people in your organization – and how many of these people are active on at least two platforms.

1. **Header:** Shows the percentage of people in your org who have access to any of Microsoft 365 Apps, and who are active on at least one of these applications on more than one platform.
2. **Body:** Provides more information on how the use of these applications on multiple platforms can promote efficiency and satisfaction.
3. **Visualization (current state):** Shows how many people use more than one platform across desktop, mobile, and web for at least one Microsoft 365 (list below) as follows:
    - **Horizontal bar** where the blue (colored) portion represents the percentage expressed in the header.
    - **The fraction** on the bar highlights the (numerator/denominator) used for calculating the percentage in the header.
        - Numerator: The number of people in your org using any application within Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Microsoft Teams, Viva Engage, and Skype on more than one platform from desktop, web, and mobile in the last 28 days.
        - Denominator: The number of people licensed for Microsoft 365 Apps, Exchange, Viva Engage, Microsoft Teams, or Skype for at least 1 of the last 28 days.
    - The **peer benchmark** value for the key metric is also shown as a percentage.

#### Trend visualization of the primary insight

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mobility-primary.png" alt-text="Chart showing number of people who use more than one platform vs. time.":::

This chart shows the trend-line, where the numerator is the number of people who have used apps, over the last 180 days. Each data point on the line chart is an aggregate of activity for the last 28 days. Each data point provides a count of all people in your org using an application across at least two platforms in the last 28 days for each date on the x-axis.

### Scoring framework

The mobility score for your organization measures at an organization (aggregate) level whether people are using Microsoft 365 Apps - Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Viva Engage, and Skype - across the different platforms - desktop, web, and mobile.

The scores are not provided at the individual user level.
