# Adoption Score Organizational Messages

Organizational messages enable IT admins to deliver clear, actionable messages in-product and in a targeted way, while maintaining user-level privacy. Organizational messages in Adoption Score use targeted in-product notifications to advise on Microsoft 365 recommended practices based on Adoption Score insights. Users can be reminded to use products that have recently been deployed, encouraged to try a product on a different surface, or to recommend new ways of working, such as using @mentions to improve response rates in communications. Templated messages are delivered to users in their flow of work through surfaces including Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. Authorized professionals can use the organizational messages wizard in Adoption Score to choose from up to three templated message types, define when and how often a message can be displayed, and exclude groups or priority accounts from receiving the message.

Organizational messages for Adoption Score will initially roll out to Communication, Content Collaboration, Mobility, and more to follow to support all People Experience categories. Check out the [2022 Ignite session](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/ff17a80f-2fa6-4e52-b92c-745f0ca8d574?source=sessions) for a detailed demonstration and feature description.

> [!NOTE]
> The feature is currently in preview. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions, please give us feedback in the Microsoft 365 admin center. We appreciate your feedback and will reach out to you as fast as we can.

## Who can use the feature?

For a successful preview experience, you need to be one of the following admin roles:

- Global administrator

- Organizational message writer

The organizational message writer role is the new built-in role that allows assigned admins to view and configure messages. The global administrator can assign the organizational message writer role to admin:

1. Go to **Roles** \> **Role assignments**

2. Search for and select **Organizational message writer**

3. Under **Assigned**, select **Add users** or **Add groups**

4. Choose a group of admins you'd like to assign the role to, and select **Add**

## Where will the messages appear?

In this preview, we support the teaching call-out and business bars in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook Desktop Apps..
Business bars are supported by Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers, Office 2019, Office 2016, Office 2013, and Office 2010.

## Getting Started

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Reports** \> **Adoption Score.**

We currently have organizational messages for three people experience categories: Communication, Content collaboration, and Mobility. In each category, you'll find available actions to take under the **How can I impact my score** section. Select **See what action you can take** \> **Create message** to start the process.

To see all available organizational messages, go to the **Action (Preview)** tab next to **Overview**. There are currently five available messages for you to create. Choose one and select **Create message** to start.

## Capabilities

As global administrator or organizational message writer role, you can do any of the following actions:

- Choose a message from a set of templated content for business bars or teaching call-outs

- Select the recipients based on user activities, Azure AD user groups, and group level aggregates

- Schedule a time frame and frequency for delivery of the messages

- Save drafts anytime during the message creation process

- Track the status of organizational messages and user engagement

- Manage scheduled or active organizational messages

    - **Groups**: In addition to the default recipients, you can send messages to specific Azure AD user groups

## FAQs

### Q: Why does the total number of messages seen differ from the expected number?

A: For any given message, not every user **in its selected audience** (selected as message recipients) will receive the message. This is expected behavior because the message delivery depends on other factors that affect a message's reach, including:

- **User behavior**: some delivery channels require the user to go to a specific location/app to have a chance to see the message (for example, a  Microsoft 365 app call-out message can only be delivered to a user who opens the Microsoft 365 app).

- **System protections to prevent over-messaging and user dissatisfaction**: some communication channels have message frequency limits if too many messages are live at a given time (for example, a Teaching call-out won't appear more than twice to each user).

### Q: How can I test the messages before sending them to users of my entire company?

A: You can send messages to specific Azure AD groups, such as your IT department. See [Select the recipients](#step-2-select-the-recipients) for details.

### Q: What is the recommended time frame window for the messages?

A: As the frequency of the messages is at most once a week, the recommended minimum duration is one month. The recommended length of the time window is 12 months. The recipient's list is refreshed daily. Your messages will always be sent to users who haven't adopted the recommended practices in the last 28 days. Messages won't repeatedly send to users who have already adopted.

### Q: Will I be able to customize the text in the messages?

A: Not currently, but additional customization options will be enabled in future releases.
