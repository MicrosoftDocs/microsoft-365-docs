# Office app for iOS for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

The Microsoft Office app for iOS combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app available for download for iOS phones. With the Office app for iOS, you can connect to Office 365 just as you would with the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps. The Office app for iOS download won't affect any existing installations of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

A few Office app for iOS features isn't available for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet customers:

- Image to text and Image to table 
- Converting photos to Word documents from Lens 
- Transfer files action 
- Notes remain local and don't sync to server
- Link preview within Scan QR
- Live persona cards in the Me section
- Classification, labeling, and protection (CLP)


## Download the Office app for iOS

- Download the Office app for iPhones from the [App Store](https://products.office.com/mobile/office?rtc=2). 

> [!NOTE]
> The Office app for iOS is currently available for iPhone only. Support for iPad will be added at a later time. 

## Security considerations

If your organization pushes apps to employee mobile devices, we suggest replacing the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps with the Office app for iOS.
