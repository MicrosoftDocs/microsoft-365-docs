# Office app for Android for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

With the Office app for Android you can connect to Office 365 just as you would with the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps. The Office app for Android download won't affect any existing installations of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
