# Office app for Android for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

The Microsoft Office app for Android combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app available for download for Android phones. With the Office app for Android, you can connect to Office 365 just as you would with the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps. The Office app for Android download won't affect any existing installations of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

A few Office app for Android features aren't available for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet customers:

- Image to text and Image to table 
- Converting photos to Word documents from Lens 
- Transfer files action 
- Notes remain local and don't sync to server
- Link preview within Scan QR
- Live persona cards in the Me section
- Classification, labeling, and protection (CLP)

## Security considerations

If your organization pushes apps to employee mobile devices, we suggest replacing the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps with the Office app for Android.
