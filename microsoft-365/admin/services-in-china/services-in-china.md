# Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

Office 365 operated by 21Vianet is designed to meet the needs for secure, reliable and scalable cloud services in China. This service is powered by technology that Microsoft has licensed to 21Vianet.
  
Microsoft does not operate the service itself. 21Vianet operates, provides and manages delivery of the service. 21Vianet is the largest carrier-neutral Internet data center services provider in China, providing hosting, managed network services, and cloud computing infrastructure services. By licensing Microsoft technologies, 21Vianet operates local Office 365 datacenters to provide you the ability to use Office 365 services while keeping your data within China. 21Vianet also provides your subscription and billing services, as well as support.

 **About services in Office 365 operated by 21Vianet**
  
The sections below highlight some of the differences you will find in each service. Ultimately our goal is to achieve parity with global services. However, due to the unique nature of the China services - operated by a partner from datacenters inside China - there are some features that have not yet been enabled. Customers will see the services come closer to full feature parity over time. For a more detailed look at services available for each Office 365 plan operated by 21Vianet, see the [Office 365 Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-operated-by-21vianet).

## Exchange

 New with Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 5 (CU5), full-featured hybrid deployments between on-premises Exchange 2013 organizations and Office 365 services are now supported. Leveraging new improvements in the Hybrid Configuration wizard, Exchange 2013 CU5 supports the following hybrid features between your on-premises and Exchange Online organizations:  

- Secure mail routing between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations. 
- Mail routing with a shared domain namespace. For example, both on-premises and Exchange Online organizations use the @contoso.com SMTP domain. 
- A unified global address list (GAL), also called a "shared address book."  
- Free/busy and calendar sharing between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.  
- Centralized control of inbound and outbound mail flow. You can configure all inbound and outbound Exchange Online messages to be routed through the on-premises Exchange organization. 
- A single Office Outlook Web App URL for both the on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.  
- The ability to move existing on-premises mailboxes to the Exchange Online organization. Exchange Online mailboxes can also be moved back to the on-premises organization if needed.  
- Centralized mailbox management using the on-premises Exchange admin center (EAC).  
- MailTips, HD photo support for Outlook contacts, and multi-mailbox search between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations. 
- Cloud-based message archiving for on-premises Exchange mailboxes.

- [Create a Hybrid Deployment with the Hybrid Configuration Wizard](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/deploy-hybrid)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [Exchange Server Deployment Assistant](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506768) is a free web-based tool that helps you configure a hybrid deployment between your on-premises organization and Office 365, or to migrate completely to Office 365. The tool asks you a small set of simple questions and then, based on your answers, creates a customized checklist with instructions to configure your hybrid deployment. We strongly recommend using the Deployment Assistant to configure a hybrid deployment. >  For organizations not wishing to upgrade to or add Exchange 2013 CU5 servers, Exchange 2013 SP1 organizations can configure shared calendar free/busy sharing between their on-premises and Exchange Online organizations. To configure this hybrid deployment feature, see [Configuring Exchange hybrid deployment features with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://support.microsoft.com/office/26e7cc26-c980-4cc5-a082-c333de544b6d).
