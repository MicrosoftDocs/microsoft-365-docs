# Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

Office 365 operated by 21Vianet is designed to meet the needs for secure, reliable and scalable cloud services in China. This service is powered by technology that Microsoft has licensed to 21Vianet.

Microsoft does not operate the service itself. 21Vianet operates, provides, and manages delivery of the service. 21Vianet is the largest carrier-neutral Internet data center services provider in China, providing hosting, managed network services, and cloud computing infrastructure services. By licensing Microsoft technologies, 21Vianet operates local Office 365 datacenters to provide you the ability to use Office 365 services while keeping your data within China. 21Vianet also provides your subscription and billing services, as well as support.

 **About services in Office 365 operated by 21Vianet**

The sections below highlight some of the differences you will find in each service. Ultimately our goal is to achieve parity with global services. However, due to the unique nature of the China services - operated by a partner from datacenters inside China - there are some features that have not yet been enabled. Customers will see the services come closer to full feature parity over time. For a more detailed look at services available for each Office 365 plan operated by 21Vianet, see the [Office 365 Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-operated-by-21vianet).

- Secure mail routing between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Exchange Server Deployment Assistant](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506768) is a free web-based tool that helps you configure a hybrid deployment between your on-premises organization and Office 365, or to migrate completely to Office 365. The tool asks you a small set of simple questions and then, based on your answers, creates a customized checklist with instructions to configure your hybrid deployment. We strongly recommend using the Deployment Assistant to configure a hybrid deployment. >  For organizations not wishing to upgrade to or add Exchange 2013 CU5 servers, Exchange 2013 SP1 organizations can configure shared calendar free/busy sharing between their on-premises and Exchange Online organizations. To configure this hybrid deployment feature, see [Configuring Exchange hybrid deployment features with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://support.microsoft.com/office/26e7cc26-c980-4cc5-a082-c333de544b6d).
