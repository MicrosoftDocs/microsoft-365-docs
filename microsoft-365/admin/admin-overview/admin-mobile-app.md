## Frequently asked questions

Below are answers to frequently asked questions.

### Does the admin app support multi-tenant billing features?

The admin mobile app is missing a few multi-tenant features where the authorized admin can see the products and licenses of the tenant in question along with the products and licenses of associated tenants in a single view.

This feature is not yet part of Microsoft 365 Admin mobile app and will be coming soon. For more information, admins can go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
