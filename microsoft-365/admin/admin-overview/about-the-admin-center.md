# About the Microsoft 365 admin center

**If you purchased a Microsoft 365 for business plan AND you have admin permissions, you have access to the admin center**. This article is for you!

**If you are a user or have a Microsoft 365 Family plan, you do not have an admin center.** To set up Microsoft 365, go to [Download and install or reinstall Microsoft 365 or Office 2019 on a PC or Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/office/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658).

You use the admin center to set up your organization in the cloud, manage users, manage subscriptions, and much more. In this article, learn how to get to the admin center and learn about available features and settings.

## How to get to the admin center

1. Sign in at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin.microsoft.com</a> with your admin account.

2. Select the app launcher icon in the upper-left and choose **Admin**.

    The **Admin** tile appears only to people who have Microsoft 365 [admin permissions](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md). If you don't see the tile, then you don't have permissions to access the admin center for your organization.
