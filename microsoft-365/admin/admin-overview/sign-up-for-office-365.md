### Need help with choosing a plan?

Deciding on a plan can depend on your specific business needs. The Microsoft 365 plan chooser is designed to help you with this. The chooser will make recommendations based on your answers to questions such as the size of your business, your field of work, the devices you use, and what kind of features, IT support, and security you're looking for. See [Help me find the right plan for my business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2224286).

Sales consultants are available to answer your questions. Go to [Compare all products](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2) and choose one of the contact support options listed at the left side of the page.

## Ready to sign up for a free trial or buy a subscription?

Go to [Compare all products](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2) to choose the plan you want to buy and to start the sign-up wizard. 
  
If you start with a free trial, you can [buy it later](../../commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md). All your users and data from the trial will still be there.
  
You don't need to cancel your trial. If you don't buy the trial subscription, it automatically expires at the end of the trial period, and all the information is permanently deleted.

## You'll be asked for the following information when you sign up

- **The address and contact information for your subscription:**

  - **Country** where the services will be used. You **won't** be able to change the country/region later, even during the sign-up process; you'll have to restart the sign-up wizard.

  - **Email** and **phone number** so we can contact you if needed about your subscription. For example, if you forget your password, we would use this information to send you a temporary one. We also send your billing information to the email address you specify.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The email address you enter here is different from your Microsoft 365 email address (your logon name, below). Because this is where we also send your billing information, we recommend you use an e-mail address that's appropriate for receiving business email.
  
- **A sign-in name (user ID):** This user ID becomes your initial Microsoft 365 email address, just to get you started quickly.

    This user ID is the email address that you use to sign in. For example, if your business name is Fourth Coffee, you might choose rob@fourthcoffee.onmicrosoft.com for your user ID.

    Most people add their own custom domain shortly after they sign up so they can start getting email to it. For example, if you have a custom domain named fourthcoffee.com, you can set up your email address as rob@fourthcoffee.com.

- **Payment information:**

    You can pay for your subscription with a credit card. If the cost reaches a certain amount, you may also have the option to pay by invoice.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  When you sign up, be sure to choose the best payment option for your organization. Changing payment options involves calling billing support.
