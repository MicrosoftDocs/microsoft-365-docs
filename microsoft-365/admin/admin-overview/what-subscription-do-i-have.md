# Which Microsoft 365 subscription do I have?

If you're an admin, you can verify which subscriptions your organization has by going to the admin center.
  
**Not an admin?** See [What Microsoft 365 for business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd)

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. On the **Products** tab, you see all your subscriptions. Each subscription line includes information about licenses, subscription status, and billing.
3. If you want to change the columns that appear in the list, select **Choose columns**. Change the selection of columns, then select **Save**.
4. To see more details for a single subscription, select that subscription.
