# What Microsoft business subscriptions do I have?

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Not sure what Microsoft business subscriptions your organization has? If you're an admin, you can see a list of your subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
  
**Not an admin?** See [What Microsoft 365 for business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd)

## Before you begin

You must be a global or billing admin to view the subscriptions for your organization. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Find out what subscriptions you have

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
   - If you’re using the **Simplified view**, select **Subscriptions**.
   - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. The **Your products** page displays a list of all your subscriptions. Each line includes information about the product name, the number of assigned licenses, the total number of licenses, and the subscription status.
3. If you're using the **Dashboard view** and you have multiple billing accounts, select **Change billing account** to select a different billing account to see the subscriptions associated with it. 
4. If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, you can change the columns that appear in the list on the **Your products** page. Select the **List options** icon next to the search box, change the column selections, then select **Save**.
5. To see more details for a single subscription, select that subscription.
