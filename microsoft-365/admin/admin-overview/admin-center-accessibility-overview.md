# Microsoft 365 admin center accessibility overview

This article applies to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Microsoft is committed to ensuring our products and services are designed for everyone including over one billion people with disabilities. For more information, visit [Accessibility Technology & Tools | Microsoft Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility/).

We prioritize inclusive design and accessibility in products and services. Microsoft publishes Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) describing how our products and services support the criteria of the European accessibility standard, EN 301 549; Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act; and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A copy of the accessibility conformance reports for **M365 admin center - Web** are available at [Microsoft Accessibility Conformance Reports](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/government/2018/09/11/accessibility-conformance-reports/).

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. The Microsoft 365 admin center is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content don't fully conform to the accessibility standard.

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

The Microsoft 365 admin center is designed to be compatible with the latest versions of NVDA, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome. A Microsoft 365 Admin app is available for iOS and Android, and users can use Voiceover and Talkback screen readers on those devices.
