# Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft 365 admin center gives users a central location to take care of common admin tasks, such as: 

- Manage users: [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../add-users/add-users.md), [Delete or restore users](../add-users/delete-a-user.md), or [Reset a user's password](../add-users/reset-passwords.md).

- Get help with billing: [Billing](../../commerce/index.yml)

- See activity reports: [Activity Reports](../activity-reports/activity-reports.md)

- [Create a Microsoft 365 group](../create-groups/create-groups.md)

- [Manage a Microsoft 365 group](../create-groups/manage-groups.md)

## Two dashboard views

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> has two views: simplified view helps smaller organizations manage their most common tasks. Dashboard view includes more complex settings and tasks. You can switch between them from a button at the top of the admin center.

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> is where you manage your business in the cloud. You can complete such tasks as adding and removing users, changing licenses, and resetting passwords.

Specialist workspaces, like Security or Device management, allow for more granular control. For more information about how the admin centers work together, see [What about the specific types of IT roles and other workspaces like Security, Device Management, or Exchange?](#what-about-the-specific-types-of-it-roles-and-other-workspaces-like-security-device-management-or-exchange) in this article.

To get to the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) or, if you're already signed in, select the app launcher, and choose **Admin**.

On the home page, you can create cards for tasks that you perform frequently. To add a new card, select **Add card**, then select the plus sign next to the card you want to add. When you are finished, close the window. You can rearrange the cards by selecting and then dragging them to where you want. To remove a card, select the three dots (more actions), and then choose **Remove**.

To view more admin tasks, expand the navigation menu. You'll find advanced configuration settings in the additional admin centers at the bottom.

One common task that you might perform in the admin center is adding a user. To do this, select **Users**, **Active users**, and then select **Add a user**. Enter the user's name and other information, and then select **Next**. Follow the prompts to finish adding the user. When you are done, select **Finish adding**, and then select **Close**.

If you need support at any time, choose **Need help**. Enter your question, then check out the links that appear. If you don't get your answer here, choose **Contact support** to open a service request.

For more information on managing billing, passwords, users, and admins, see the other lessons in this course.

## Who is an admin?

By default, the person who signs up for and buys an Microsoft 365 for business subscription gets admin permissions. That person can assign admin permissions to other people to help them manage Microsoft 365 for their organization.

If you get the message "**You don't have permission to access this page or perform this action**," you aren't an admin.

### Who has admin permissions in my business?

When looking for your admin to reset your password, delete an account, or do other tasks, here's who you should contact:

- **Universities and schools**: Contact your technical support team. Usually you can find a link on your university site. At smaller schools, there may be just a few individuals who have admin permissions.

- **Large businesses**: Contact your internal help desk / technical support.

- **Small businesses**: Contact the business owner / co-owner. Often they give admin permissions to their IT consultant who does all the computer maintenance work for their business.

If you have no idea who to contact at your work or school for help, try asking the person who gave you your user account and password.

> [!NOTE]
> Targeted release admins have first access to new features. New features later roll out to all admins. This means that you might not see the admin center, or it might look different than what is described in help articles. To be among the first to see new features, see Participate in the admin center, below.

## Turn on Targeted release

1. Sign in at [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to the navigation pane and select **Settings** > **Org settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2067339" target="_blank">**Organization profile** tab</a>.

2. Go to the **Release preferences** card, and then select **Edit**.

3. Select either **Targeted release for everyone** or **Targeted release for selected users**. If you choose Targeted release for selected users, make sure that you add your admin account (and any other admins in your org who want to participate) to the list of selected users.

## Admin center feedback
