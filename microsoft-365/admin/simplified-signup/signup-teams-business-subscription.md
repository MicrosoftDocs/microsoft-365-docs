## Frequently asked questions

### What is a business email and what are the advantages to setting one up?

A business email is an email that uses your own domain name. For example, if you own the domain name `contoso.com`, you can build a website using the url `www.contoso.com`, but you can also have a custom email address such as yourname@contoso.com. This is referred to as a branded business email as it gives your email a professional look.

### How do I get a new business email address?

There are three options for getting a business email.

- You can use a suggested onmicrosoft.com domain for free (someone@mybusiness.onmicrosoft.com).
- You can buy a new domain to have a more compact email address (mybusinessname@contoso.com).
- You use a domain name that you already own.

### Why might I need to verify my domain to create a business email?

If you choose to use a domain you already own, you can use it for your email address with Microsoft 365. As part of the sign up process, we ask you to verify the domain for security purposes and to protect against fraudulent activity.

### How does recurring billing work?

When Recurring billing is on, your subscription will continue to be billed each month (or year, depending on your billing plan) on the day you subscribed. You can turn it off or back on again in the admin center if your subscription is active.
