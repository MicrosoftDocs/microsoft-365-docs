# Accept an email invitation to a Microsoft 365 for business subscription organization using an Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail or other account (User)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps apply to Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Basic and Microsoft 365 Apps for business.

When someone adds you to a Microsoft 365 for business organization, you'll get an email invitation with steps on how to join. In this scenario, you're joining an organization that doesn't have a different professional email for users. You'll sign in with your regular email account.

## Frequently asked questions

### The webpage is asking me to agree that my business has access to my name, sign-in and other information – what does that mean?

In virtually all cases, any documents and chats you save into the Microsoft 365 cloud (OneDrive, Teams) using your Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo or other email account **won't be** accessible by your technical admin. You own your documents and chats.

However, as part of setting up Microsoft 365 business, you are consenting that your technical admin will have access to a limited amount of account information, specifically, your account information, such as your name, profile picture, email address, and your sign-in details and activity.

For further information about data privacy, refer to the [Terms of use](https://ssu.office.com/terms/en-US/smb_eula.txt).

### How can I leave this business (and stop using this license)?

There are a couple of options in this case:  

1. You can contact the business owner or admin of the other business and ask to be removed from that business.

2. You can remove yourself by following the steps below:

    1. Go to https://myapps.microsoft.com/.
    2. Sign in to your account, and select your profile initials.
    3. Select **View account** > **Manage organizations** > **Leave organization**
    4. Select **Leave** > **OK**.

### I’m getting an error saying I’m part of another business.  What do I do?

You will need to leave your previous Microsoft 365 Business subscription first. Either talk to your previous technical admin or business owner and ask them to remove you. You can also visit [https://myaccount.microsoft.com/](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/) and follow the steps below.

1. Sign in to your account, and select your profile initials.
2. Select **View account** > **Manage organizations** > **Leave organization**
3. Select **Leave** > **OK**.

### I have a question about using this account. Who can I talk to?

Contact our small business support experts who can help you upgrade your Microsoft 365 subscription. Learn more at [Get support](../get-help-support.md).

### The Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo or other email account that I’m using as a Microsoft Account already has some personal files in it. Can the technical administrator or business owner see these?

**No**. Any documents or chats you saved in the Microsoft 365 cloud (OneDrive, Teams) under your old Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo or other email account **won't be** accessible by your administrator.  You own your documents and chats.

The only data that will be made accessible to your administrator is your account information, such as your name, profile picture, email address, and your sign-in details and activity.

### Does the way I login to Windows change?

No it doesn’t, you can still log in the same way as before.

### How can I send and receive emails with Microsoft 365 Business?

You will still be using your Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo or other email account.  You can continue to access your email in the browser as you did before. For the best experience, [connect these email accounts to Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b).
