# Migrate data to my Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription

Follow the steps in this article to move your OneDrive, Outlook and Teams data to your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can still keep your data in your personal account. The data in your personal account won’t expire once you create a new business email account and migrate your data. You can move all your data to your new business account or you can move some of your data. For example, you can move your work documents to your business account, but keep your personal family photos in your personal account.

## Move files to OneDrive for business

This section describes how to move the files stored in your Microsoft 365 personal account to your Microsoft 365 business account. With both OneDrive accounts synced to your device, you can easily drag and drop the files between two OneDrive folders.

1. Select the OneDrive white cloud icon in the Windows notification area and make sure your OneDrive personal account is synced to your device.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might need to select the **Show hidden icons** arrow next to the notification area to see the OneDrive icon. If the icon doesn't appear in the notification area, OneDrive might not be running. Select **Start**, type OneDrive in the search box, and then select OneDrive in the search results.

2. To add your new business account, select  **Help & Settings** > **Settings**.

3. In **Settings**, select **Account** > **Add an account**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you haven't set up OneDrive with your current Microsoft 365 personal account before, follow the steps above to set up your personal account on your device and sync your files before moving to the next steps.

### Drag and drop files in OneDrive

With both your Microsoft 365 personal and business accounts synced to your device, you can now move your files from your personal OneDrive folder to your new business OneDrive folder.

1. In File Explorer, open your synced OneDrive folder that contains your files.

2. Select and drag the files you want from your OneDrive personal folder to your new OneDrive business folder.

### Notes about moving files from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work

- If you’re moving a large number of files, we recommend that you move files in batches of no more than 100 files each.

- Files you move from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work are recognized as new files, and as a result, these files don’t retain metadata details such as Modified and Modified By.

- If you shared files in OneDrive before, you'll need to share these files again in your new OneDrive for work after you move them. Also, once you share these files, we recommend that you delete the original files from OneDrive. This way, people won’t be able to refer to out-of-date copies of files you’d shared with them earlier.

## Step: Set up Outlook for email

1. On the Windows Start menu, search for Outlook, and select it.

    (If you're using a Mac, open Outlook from the toolbar or locate it using the Finder.)

    If you've just installed Outlook, on the Welcome page, select **Next**.

2. Choose **File** \> **Info** \> **Add Account**.

3. Enter your Microsoft email address and select **Connect**.

## Move data from your personal Microsoft Teams account to new Teams for work account

1. Open Microsoft Teams, select your profile icon, and then **Add work or school account**.

2. Follow the steps to add your new account to Teams for work. Check out [Sign in and get started with Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-get-started-with-teams-6723dc43-dbc0-46e6-af49-8a2d1c5cb937) for more info.

### Access Teams chats

When you start using Teams with your new work account your data won’t be migrated over. The best way to see your old chats is to open your old Teams account and new work account side by side. You can do this by selecting the ME icon on the top right of Teams and choosing the account’s you’d like to open. You can start using Teams with your new work account  with your colleagues. Make sure to tell other users you chat with to start contacting you using your new Teams for work account.

### Microsoft Teams meetings

Once you have your new Microsoft Teams account for work set up, you can recreate your meetings in the Teams calendar. Remember to delete the original meetings in your old Teams account. This will allow you to access richer functionality - for example, calendar availability when scheduling, and the ability to record meetings. You can only delete meetings from your own Teams calendar, so make sure you let people who you have meetings with know that you’ll be recreating your meetings. As you transition to use your new Teams account for your meetings, if people who should be in your meetings are missing, contact them to make sure they haven’t joined old meeting link.

### Migrating contacts

To migrate your contacts from your personal Teams account, find the contact's email address and add the user to your new Teams account for work.
