Follow the steps in this article to move your OneDrive, Outlook and Teams data to your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can still keep your data in your personal account. The data in your personal account won’t expire once you create a new business email account and migrate your data. You can move all your data to your new business account or you can move some of your data. For example, you can move your work documents to your business account, but keep your personal family photos in your personal account.

## Move data from your personal Microsoft Teams account to new Teams for work account

1. Open Microsoft Teams, select your profile icon, and then **Add work or school account**.

2. Follow the steps to add your new account to Teams for work. Check out [Sign in and get started with Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-get-started-with-teams-6723dc43-dbc0-46e6-af49-8a2d1c5cb937) for more info.

### Access Teams chats

When you start using Teams with your new work account your data won’t be migrated over. The best way to see your old chats is to open your old Teams account and new work account side by side. You can do this by selecting the ME icon on the top right of Teams and choosing the account’s you’d like to open. You can start using Teams with your new work account  with your colleagues. Make sure to tell other users you chat with to start contacting you using your new Teams for work account.

### Microsoft Teams meetings

Once you have your new Microsoft Teams account for work set up, you can recreate your meetings in the Teams calendar. Remember to delete the original meetings in your old Teams account. This will allow you to access richer functionality - for example, calendar availability when scheduling, and the ability to record meetings. You can only delete meetings from your own Teams calendar, so make sure you let people who you have meetings with know that you’ll be recreating your meetings. As you transition to use your new Teams account for your meetings, if people who should be in your meetings are missing, contact them to make sure they haven’t joined old meeting link.

### Migrating contacts

To migrate your contacts from your personal Teams account, find the contact's email address and add the user to your new Teams account for work.
