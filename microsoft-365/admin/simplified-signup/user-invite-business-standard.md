# Accept an email invitation to a Microsoft 365 for business subscription (User)

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps apply to Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Basic and Microsoft 365 Apps for business.

When you’re already using Microsoft 365 Business with a Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo (or similar) email address, someone (for example your administrator or business owner) may invite you to upgrade Microsoft 365 to start using professional branded email.  In this scenario, you’ll be switching email address and learning how to upgrade.
