# Meetings – People experiences

Productivity Score provides insights into your organization's digital transformation journey through its use of Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support it. Your organization's score reflects people and technology experience measurements and can be compared to benchmarks from organizations similar to yours. The meetings category is part of the people experiences measures. To learn more, check out the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md) and read [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

## Prerequisites

To get started with Meetings insights, people in your organization need to be licensed for:

- Microsoft Teams

For more information, see [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).

After people have been active in Teams at least once in the last 28 days, you will start to see the insights.

## Why your organization's meetings score matters

Meetings, where people explore ideas, plan, solve problems, and make decisions, are a fundamental pillar for organizational productivity. Research indicates that when people use online meeting tools effectively, they tend to save up to 104 minutes per week.

## How we calculate the meetings score

We provide a primary insight in the experience that contains the key metrics for this category. Then, a scoring framework, detailed below, is used for these metrics to calculate your organization's score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft Teams integrate with Outlook calendar and provides a host of capabilities to make your meetings more engaging and effective. The primary insight looks at all Microsoft Teams online meetings that were held in your organization. The Primary insight also tracks how many meetings follow at least one of the best practices for Teams meetings.

1. **Header:** Shows the percentage of online meetings on Microsoft Teams held in the past 28 days that had video or screen sharing during the meeting.
2. **Body:** Provides more information on how following best practices for engagement during a meeting, such as use of video or screen sharing, can make meetings more effective.
3. **Visualization (current state):**

      - In this horizontal bar chart, the blue (colored) portion represents the percentage shown in the header
      - The fraction (numerator/denominator) is used for calculating the percentage shown in the header
         - Numerator: The number of online Microsoft Teams meetings including people from your organization who have used video or screen sharing.
         - Denominator: The number of online Microsoft Teams meetings including people from your organization that were held in the last 28 days.
      - The peer benchmark value of the key metric is also shown as a percentage.

#### Trend visualization of the primary insight

The following chart shows the trend-lines of both the numerator and the denominator of the key metric from the primary insight. In other words, it shows the number of online Microsoft Teams meetings with best practices, such as video or screen sharing, and the total number of online Microsoft Teams meetings held over the last 180 days. Each data point on the line chart is an aggregate of activity for the last 28 days.

### Scoring framework

The meetings score for your organization measures the degree to which online Microsoft Teams meetings in your organization  followed best practices in the last 28 days. It is weighted based on the number of people in your org attending the meetings and the meetings' duration.
