# Teamwork – People experiences

Productivity Score helps organizations transform how work gets done with metrics about how people use Microsoft 365 apps and the supporting technology experiences. The score reflects your organization&#39;s performance for people and technology experience categories and compares your score with organizations like yours. The Teamwork category is part of the measurements that falls under people experiences. See the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md) to learn more.

## Why your org&#39;s teamwork score matters

A fundamental pillar for organizational productivity is when a group of people with a common goal work with each other and with common resources for collective success. Research indicates that when people share information and collaborate in shared workspaces, they save up to 4 hours a week. They can find related documents, find context for previous discussions, and deliver towards shared goals. See the[evidence](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Total-Economic-Impact-Microsoft-Teams.pdf)

## How we calculate the score

We provide a primary insight in the experience that contains the key metrics for this category. Then, a scoring framework, detailed below, is used for these metrics to calculate your score.

### Primary insight

The primary insight looks at all the people who are communicating using email and messages on Microsoft Teams, and interacting with content on the cloud in shared workspaces. Within Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 Groups are the foundation for people to come together in a shared workspace with the ability to send emails to the group mailbox, share files on the SharePoint team site, and send channel messages through Microsoft Teams.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/teamwork-score.png" alt-text="Chart showing primary insights into the teamwork score.":::

1. **Header:** Provides the key metric of people performing any one the following activities:
      - Sending email to a group mailbox through Exchange.
      - Sending channel messages through Teams
      - Reading and creating content (what we collectively refer to as content interaction) in SharePoint team sites.

        As a percentage of all people who are performing any of the following activities (within or outside of shared workspaces):
        - Sending email through Exchange.
        - Sending messages (chat or channel messages) on Microsoft Teams.
        - Reading and creating content on OneDrive or SharePoint.

            And have access to at least one of the following services: Exchange, Microsoft Teams, or SharePoint

1. **Body:** Provides more information on how communicating and interacting with content, when done within a shared workspace, can have positive outcomes for productivity in your organization.
2. **Visualization (current state):**

## Explore more about teamwork in your organization

We also provide additional information about how people in your organization work together. These additional metrics don&#39;t directly contribute to your Productivity Score, but are relevant in helping you create an action plan to support further optimizations to the way people work in your organization.

### Breakdown of how people engage in shared workspaces

:::image type="content" source="../../media/people-sharedworkspace-engagement.png" alt-text="Chart that shows how people in your org are engaged in shared workspaces.":::

1. **Header:** Shows a detailed breakdown across the different types of teamwork being measured.
2. **Body:** Provides information on the value of working in shared workspaces to help teams be more effective.
3. **Visualization:** The visualization shows the extent to which people who are communicating or interacting with content are doing so in shared workspaces, as follows:
      - **Sending email**: The colored portion and the fraction represent the percentage of people sending email to group mailboxes. The fraction is comprised of:
        - Numerator: People who send email to group mailboxes in the last 28 days.
        - Denominator: People who send emails in the last 28 days. This is the same group of people who are marked as sending email in the primary insight of communication productivity score.
      - **Sending messages**: The colored portion and the fraction represent the percentage of people sending messages in channels in Microsoft Teams. The fraction is comprised of:
        - Numerator: People sending channel messages in the last 28 days.
        - Denominator: People sending chat or channel messages in the last 28 days. This is the same group of people who are marked as sending messages in Microsoft Teams in the primary insight of communication productivity score.
    - **Creating content**: The colored portion and the fraction represent the percentage of people reading or creating content on Microsoft 365 SharePoint team sites.
        - Numerator: Number of people reading or creating content on Microsoft 365 group connected team sites.

### Breakdown of workspace engagement by size and age

:::image type="content" source="../../media/workspace-engagement-bysizeage.png" alt-text="Chart that shows engagement in workspace as categorized by size and age.":::

1. **Header:** Shows the categorization of engagement in workspaces, broken out by size for the number of members in the workspace, and the workspace age in months.
2. **Body:** Provides information about the value of encouraging people in your organization to keep only the workspaces that are needed to promote more effective teamwork.
3. **Visualization:** The engagement breakdown is shown in the form of a heat-map across two dimensions.

      - **Size of workspace:** Workspaces are broken down into three categories based on the number of members:n: 2-10 people, 11-100 people, and over 100 people. The &quot;All&quot; category includes all size categories.
      - **Age of workspace:** Workspaces are categorized by the number of months since the workspace was first created. The &quot;All&quot; category includes all age categories.

        Each cell in the chart has a number and color based on the percentage of engaged workspaces that belong in that category. The workspace categories are based on the age and size shown in the intersection of that cell. For example, if the cell at the intersection of 11-100 people and 4-12 months has a value of 52%, it means that 52% of the workspaces with 11-100 members that are between 4-12 months old, have some form of engagement. The percentage is calculated as:

        - **Numerator:** Workspaces that have engagement in the form of communication (email and channel messages) or content interaction in the last 28 days
        - **Denominator:** all workspaces that are available in your org for the last 28 days

## Notes

- All references to shared workspaces include Microsoft 365 groups and the associated Teams team, SharePoint team site, and group mailbox.
- Only shared workspaces that have between 2 to 500 members are considered for teamwork in Productivity score.
- Teamwork measures the engagement of people within your organization. It doesn&#39;t capture the activity of external members.
- Channel messages in teamwork does not include messages sent through the Microsoft Teams mobile client.
- There could be minor differences between email metrics and channel messages between the communication and teamwork categories that we are working to resolve.
