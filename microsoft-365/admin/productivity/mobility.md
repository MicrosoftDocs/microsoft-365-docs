# Mobility – People experiences

Productivity Score helps organizations transform how work gets done with metrics about how people use Microsoft 365 apps and the supporting technology experiences. The score reflects your organization&#39;s performance for people and technology experience categories and compares your score with organizations like yours. The Teamwork category is part of the measurements that falls under people experiences. See the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md) to learn more.

## Why your organization&#39;s mobility score matters

A fundamental pillar of organizational productivity is how well people are able to work flexibly from wherever they are. With Microsoft 365, people can stay connected with Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and Yammer. People can also seamlessly collaborate on content by using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote from any location, and platforms.

## How we calculate the score

We provide a primary insight in the experience that contains the key metrics for this category. Then, a scoring framework detailed below is used for these metrics to calculate your score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft 365 lets people work flexibly across apps, including Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Skype. People can also work from anywhere by using a seamless experience across desktop, web, and mobile platforms. The primary insight looks at the products that are enabled for people in your organization–and how many of these people are active on at least two platforms.

        - Numerator: The number of people using any application within Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Skype on more than one platform from desktop, web, and mobile in the last 28 days.
        - Denominator: The number of people licensed for Microsoft 365 apps, Exchange, Yammer, Microsoft Teams, or Skype for at least 1 of the last 28 days.
    - The **peer benchmark** value for the key metric is also shown as a percentage.

This chart shows the trend-line, where the numerator is the number of people who have used apps, over the last 180 days. Each data point on the line chart is an aggregate of activity for the last 28 days. Each data point provides a count of all people using an application across at least two platforms in the last 28 days for each date on the x-axis.

### Scoring framework

The mobility score measures whether people are using Microsoft 365 apps - Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Yammer, and Skype - across the different platforms - desktop, web, and mobile.
