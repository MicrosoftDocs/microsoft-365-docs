# Content collaboration â€“ People experiences

Productivity Score provides insights into your organization's digital transformation journey through its use of Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support it. Your organization's score reflects people and technology experience measurements and can be compared to benchmarks from organizations similar to yours. The content collaboration category is part of the people experiences measurements. To learn more, check out the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md) and read [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

## Prerequisites

To get started with Content collaboration insights, people in your organization need to be licensed for:

- OneDrive for Business
- SharePoint
- Exchange Online

For more information, see [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).

 After people have been active in the above products at least once in the last 28 days, you will start to see the insights.

## Why your organization&#39;s content collaboration score matters

A key aspect of digital transformation is how people collaborate in files. With your content on Microsoft 365, people access, create, modify, and collaborate on content with other people from any location. Research shows that when people collaborate with online files, each person saves an average of 100 minutes per week.

## How we calculate the content collaboration score

We provide a primary insight that contains the key metrics for content collaboration in your organization. Then, a scoring framework detailed below is used for these metrics to calculate your organization's score.

> [!NOTE]
> On April 22, 2021, we changed how the collaborators metric is calculated. This affects the [primary insight](#primary-insight), the [file collaboration insight](#number-of-files-collaborated-on), and the way the content collaboration score is measured. This change helps reduce noise in the data from non-human agents (or bots) from Microsoft and other third-party applications, resulting in a more accurate and actionable score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft OneDrive for Business and SharePoint help people to easily create, read, and discover their individual and shared content in Microsoft 365 from across devices and applications. They also allow people to securely share and collaborate on content. The primary insight contains information from everyone who can use OneDrive for Business and SharePoint. Additionally it breaks down the details about how many people read, create, and collaborate on content stored in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

Types considered for this information include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and PDF files.

1. **Header:** Shows the percentage of people in your org who have access to OneDrive or SharePoint who are collaborating on content.
2. **Body:** Provides more information on how the behaviors of reading and creating files online are linked to collaborating on files.
3. **Visualization (current state):**
    - Horizontal bars where the blue-colored portions represent the percentage of people enabled for file collaboration through OneDrive or SharePoint who have been **readers, creators,** or **collaborators** on online files in the last 28 days.

        They're defined as follows:</br>
        **Readers:** People who access or download online files in OneDrive or SharePoint.</br>
        **Creators:** People who create, modify, upload, sync, check in, copy, or move online OneDrive or SharePoint files.</br>
        **Collaborators:** People who collaborate with online files by using OneDrive or SharePoint. Two people are collaborators if one of them reads or edits an online Office app or PDF after the other person has created or modified it, within a 28-day window.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The files considered in the visualization are Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or PDF files that are online and saved to OneDrive or SharePoint. 

    - Highlight (numerator/denominator) of the fraction is used to calculate the percentage expressed in each of the horizontal bars.
    
      - **Readers:**</br>
          - Numerator: Number of people who access or download online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
          - Denominator: Number of people who had access to OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days</br>
      - **Creators:**</br>
        - Numerator: Number of people who create, modify, upload, sync, check in, copy, or move online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
        - Denominator: Number of people who have had access to OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days. </br> 
      - **Collaborators:**</br>
        - Numerator: Number of people who have collaborated on online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
        - Denominator: Number of people who have had access to for OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days

    - Peer benchmark value for each of readers, creators, and collaborators is also shown as a percentage. In other words, the value of the number of creators is shown as a percentage of the number of people who have access to OneDrive or SharePoint.

#### Trend visualization of primary insight

The trend visualizations chart shows the trend-line of the primary insight key metrics for readers, creators, and collaborators, over the last 180 days. Each data point on the chart is an aggregate of activity for the last 28 days. Each creator data-point provides a count of all people who were tagged as creators within the last 28 days for each date on the x axis.

### Scoring framework

The content collaboration score for your organization measures at an aggregate (organization) level whether people are consistently reading, creating, or collaborating on online Office files such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or PDFs, or in OneDrive or SharePoint.

Scores are not provided at the individual user level.

## Explore how your organization collaborates

We also provide you with information that helps you gain visibility into how your organization collaborates on content. These additional metrics don't directly contribute to your Productivity Score but help you create an action plan as part of your digital transformation to help optimize the way people work.
