# Create DNS records at Dyn.com for Microsoft

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
If Dyn.com is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.
 

  
> [!NOTE]
>  Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Add a TXT record for verification
<a name="BKMK_verify"> </a>

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Dyn.com by using [this link](https://account.dyn.com/dns/). You'll be prompted to login first.
    
    ![Dyn-BP-Configure-1-1](../../media/77597d44-9b04-43b1-8e23-d4fad238def2.png)
  
2. On the **Zone Level Services** page, select **Dyn Standard DNS Service** for the domain that you want to edit. 
    
3. On the **DNS** page for your domain, select **Preferences**.
    
4. Select **Enable Expert Interface**.
    
5. In the **Add DNS Record** section, in the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table. 
    
    (Choose the **Type** value from the drop-down list.) 
    
    |**Host**|**TTL**|**Type**|**Data**|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |(Leave this field empty.)  <br/> |600  <br/> |TXT  <br/> |MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*  <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table.           [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)          |
       
   ![Dyn-BP-Verify-1-1](../../media/b3730b15-a313-4b4c-b91e-646eebb649e8.png)

    ![Dyn-BP-Verify-1-2](../../media/8b63b4ee-dbd7-44a7-b1e6-c6892b02f13e.png)
  
7. Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record.
  
When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
1. In the Microsoft admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">Domains</a> page.

    
2. On the **Domains** page, select the domain that you are verifying. 
    
    
  
3. On the **Setup** page, select **Start setup**.
    
    
  
4. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

Add it to the beginning of the MX value, separated from the remainder of the value by a space.  <br/> **Note:** Get your  *\<domain-key\>*  from your Microsoft account.           [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)      <br>    For more information about priority, see [What is MX priority?](../setup/domains-faq.yml) <br/> |

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam
<a name="BKMK_add_TXT"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a  *single*  SPF record that includes both sets of values.
