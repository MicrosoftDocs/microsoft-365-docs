# Create DNS records at Names.co.uk for Microsoft

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
If Names.co.uk is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.
    
After you add these records at Names.co.uk, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.
  

  
> [!NOTE]
>  Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Add a TXT record for verification
<a name="BKMK_verify"> </a>

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like. 
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page at Names.co.uk by using [this link](https://account.names.co.uk/dashboard#/). You'll be prompted to log in first.
    
    ![NamesUK-BP-Configure-1-1](../../media/e5cd0e0c-57f9-4b3d-b1c2-0d6b260f5524.png)
  
2. On the **Dashboard** page, find the name of the domain that you are updating, and then choose **DNS Settings** from the drop-down list. 
    
    (You may have to scroll down.)
    
    ![NamesUK-BP-Configure-1-2](../../media/b618f8e5-404e-466a-9e71-acd7479f3994.png)
  
3. On the **Add/Modify DNS Zone** page, in the **A, CNAME, AAAA, TXT and NS records** section, in the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table. 
    
    (Choose the **Type** value from the drop-down list.) 
    
    (If you need to add a row, select **ADD A/CNAME RECORDS (+)**.)
    
    (You may have to scroll down.)
        
    |**Host name**|**Type**|**Result**|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |(Leave this field empty.)  <br/> |TXT  <br/> |MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*  <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table.           [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)    |
       
    ![NamesUK-BP-Verify-1-1](../../media/91ed1f22-a796-418d-bbb0-345e2cd99bde.png)
  
4. Select **Save**.
    
    (You may have to scroll down.)
    
    ![NamesUK-BP-Verify-1-2](../../media/40e991f9-2209-4210-8762-981cca670d70.png)
  
5. Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record.
  
When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">Domains</a> page.
    
2. On the **Domains** page, select the domain that you are verifying. 
    
    
  
3. On the **Setup** page, select **Start setup**.
    
    
  
4. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam
<a name="BKMK_add_TXT"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a  *single*  SPF record that includes both sets of values.
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page at Names.co.uk by using [this link](https://account.names.co.uk/dashboard#/). You'll be prompted to log in first.
