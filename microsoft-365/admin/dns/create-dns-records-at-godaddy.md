# Connect your DNS records at GoDaddy to Microsoft 365

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for.

If GoDaddy is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.

## Before you begin

You have two options for setting up DNS records for your domain:

- [**Use Domain Connect**](#use-domain-connect-to-verify-and-set-up-your-domain) If you haven't set up your domain with another email service provider, use the Domain Connect steps to automatically verify and set up your new domain to use with Microsoft 365.

   OR

- [**Use the manual steps**](#create-dns-records-with-manual-setup) Verify your domain using the manual steps below and choose when and which records to add to your domain registrar. This allows you to set up new MX (mail) records, for example, at your convenience.

## Use Domain Connect to verify and set up your domain

Follow these steps to automatically verify and set up your GoDaddy domain with Microsoft 365:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>, and select the domain you want to set up.

1. Select the three dots (more actions) >  choose **Start setup**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. On the How do you want to connect your domain? page, select **Continue**.

1. On the Add DNS records page, select **Add DNS records**.

1. On the GoDaddy login page, sign in to your account, and select **Authorize**.

   This completes your domain setup for Microsoft 365.

## Create DNS records with manual setup

After you add these records at GoDaddy, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

### Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at GoDaddy by using [this link](https://account.godaddy.com/products/?go_redirect=disabled).

   If you're prompted to log in, use your login credentials, select your login name in the upper right, and then select **My Products**.

1. Under **Domains**, select the three dots next to the domain you want to verify, and then select **Manage DNS**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-godaddy/godaddy-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select Manage DNS from the drop-down list.":::

1. Under **Records**, select **ADD** (You might have to scroll down).

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns/56527673-ffb3b300-651b-11e9-91c2-83dc9fe5ca30.png" alt-text="Select ADD.":::

1. Choose **TXT** from the drop-down list.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-godaddy/godaddy-domains-Type.png" alt-text="Select TXT from the Type drop-down list.":::

1. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the table.

   |Type|Host|TXT Value|TTL|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |TXT|@|MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*<br>**Note**: This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)|1 hour  <br>|

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-godaddy/godaddy-domains-TXT-values.png" alt-text="Fill in the values from the table for the TXT record.":::

1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-godaddy/godaddy-domains-TXTSave.png" alt-text="Select Save.":::

   Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.

Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record. When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
To verify the record in Microsoft 365:
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>.

1. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select **Start setup**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. Select **Continue**.
  
1. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

### Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a  *single*  SPF record that includes both sets of values.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at GoDaddy by using [this link](https://account.godaddy.com/products/?go_redirect=disabled).

   If you're prompted to log in, use your login credentials, select your login name in the upper right, and then select **My Products**.
