# Create DNS records at Network Solutions for Microsoft

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
If Network Solutions is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.
  
These are the main records to add. Follow the steps below or [watch the video](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c49698c2-6991-47fb-b5ac-18e49a505099).

- [Add the two SRV records that are required for Microsoft](#add-the-two-srv-records-that-are-required-for-microsoft)
    
After you add these records at Network Solutions, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.
  

  
> [!NOTE]
>  Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Add a TXT record for verification
<a name="BKMK_verify"> </a>

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like. 
  
Follow the steps below or [watch the video (start at 0:47)](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c49698c2-6991-47fb-b5ac-18e49a505099).
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page at Network Solutions by using [this link](https://www.networksolutions.com/manage-it). You'll be prompted to log in.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you select the **Login** button, first choose **Manage My Domain Names** in the **Log In to:** drop-down list. 
  
    ![Choose Manage My Domain Names and log in to Network Solutions](../../media/fda7d4a1-9445-4086-be9c-87c6983ef2aa.png)
  
2. Select the check box next to the name of the domain that you are modifying.
    
    ![Select the check box for your domain](../../media/2c13d2ba-4a31-44da-812c-2cc90900a183.png)
  
3. Select **Edit DNS**.
    
    ![Select Edit DNS](../../media/9d7c269f-48d1-442c-9d7b-63bd384a36a9.png)
  
4. Select **Manage Advanced DNS Records**.
    
    (You may have to scroll down.)
    
    ![Select Manage Advanced DNS Records](../../media/fd2956d6-eec3-47ea-b60a-266bab14f51f.png)
  
5. Scroll down to the **Text (TXT Records)** section, and then select **Edit TXT Records**.
    
    ![Select Edit TXT Records](../../media/240a01d6-750a-4da6-8554-641b571e4b71.png)
  
6. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values in the following table.
    
    |**Host**|**TTL**|**Text**|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |@  <br/> (The system will change this value to **@ (None)** when you save the record.)  <br/> |3600  <br/> |MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*  <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table.  [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)   |
       
    ![Type or paste values in the boxes for the new record](../../media/8a76daab-b6ff-4c82-ba68-192b24fbb934.png)

    ![Select Save Changes](../../media/bd4d7cd0-c8a3-497a-b080-cfd5a5c60dc5.png)
  
9. Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record.
  
When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">Domains</a> page.
    
2. On the **Domains** page, select the domain that you are verifying. 
    
    
  
3. On the **Setup** page, select **Start setup**.
    
    
  
4. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam
<a name="BKMK_add_TXT"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a  *single*  SPF record that includes both sets of values.
