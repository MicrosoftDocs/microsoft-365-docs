# Connect your DNS records at Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Microsoft 365

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for.

If AWS is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype Online for Business, and so on.

After you add these records at AWS, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

## Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at AWS by using [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home). You'll be prompted to log in first.

1. On the landing page, under **Domains**, select **Registered domains**.

1. Under **Domain Name**, select the domain you want to set up in Microsoft 365.

    **Note**: If you haven't created a hosted zone for your domain, select **Create hosted zone** and complete the steps before moving to the next step.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-aws/aws-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select the name of the domain you want to verify.":::

1. Select **Manage DNS**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-aws/aws-domains-2.png" alt-text="Select Manage DNS from the drop-down list.":::

1. Under **Domain name**, select the domain name for the hosted zone version of the domain you want to verify.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-aws/aws-domains-3.png" alt-text="Select the name of the domain you want to verify.":::

1. Select **Create record**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-aws/aws-domains-create-record.png" alt-text="Select Create record.":::

1. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table.

    (Choose the **Type** and **Routing policy** values from the drop-down lists.)

    > [!TIP]
    > The quotation marks required by the onscreen instructions are supplied automatically. You don't need to type them manually.

    |Record name|Record type|Value|TTL (Seconds)|Routing policy|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |(Leave this field empty.)|TXT - Used to verify email senders|MS=ms*XXXXXXXX* <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table in Microsoft 365. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)|300|Simple|

1. Select **Create records**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-aws/aws-domains-txt-create-records.png" alt-text="Select Create records.":::

   Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.

Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request a search for the record. When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in Microsoft 365:

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>.

1. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select **Start setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a *single* SPF record that includes both sets of values. Need examples? Check out these [External Domain Name System records for Microsoft](../../enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records.md). To validate your SPF record, you can use one of these[SPF validation tools](../setup/domains-faq.yml).

1. To get started, go to your domains page at AWS by using [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home). You'll be prompted to log in first.

1. On the landing page, under **Domains**, select **Registered domains**.
