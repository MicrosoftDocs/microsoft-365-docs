# Connect your DNS records at Wix to Microsoft 365

**[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for.

If Wix is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.

After you add these records at Wix, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

## Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later if you like.

> [!NOTE]
> WIX does not support DNS entries for subdomains.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Wix by using [this link](https://premium.wix.com/wix/api/mpContainerStaticController#/domains?referralAdditionalInfo=account). You'll be prompted to log in first.

2. Select **Domains** \> **...**, and then select **Manage DNS Records** from the dropdown list.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-wix/wix-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select Manage DNS Records from the drop-down list.":::

3. Select **+ Add Record** in the **TXT (Text)** row of the DNS editor.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-wix/wix-domains-TXT-add-record.png" alt-text="Select Add record.":::

4. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table.

   |Host Name|TXT Value|TTL|
   |---|---|---|
   |Automatically populated (leave blank)|MS=ms*XXXXXXXX* <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)|1 Hour|

5. Select**Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-wix/wix-domains-txt-save.png" alt-text="Select Save.":::

   Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.


Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record. When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in Microsoft 365:

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>.

1. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select **Start setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft. Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a *single* SPF record that includes both sets of values.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Wix by using [this link](https://premium.wix.com/wix/api/mpContainerStaticController#/domains?referralAdditionalInfo=account). You'll be prompted to log in first.

2. Select **Domains** \> **...**, and then select **Manage DNS Records** from the dropdown list.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-wix/wix-domains-TXT-add-record.png" alt-text="Select + Add record.":::

   **Note**: Wix provides an SPF row in the DNS editor. Ignore that row and use the **TXT (Text)** row to enter the SPF values below.

4. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table:

   |Host Name|Value|TTL|
   |---|---|---|
   |[leave this blank]|v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all <br/> **Note:** We recommend copying and pasting this entry, so that all of the spacing stays correct.|1 Hour|

5. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-wix/wix-domains-txt-save.png" alt-text="Select Save.":::

   Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
