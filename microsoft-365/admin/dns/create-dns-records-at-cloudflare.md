# Connect your DNS records at Cloudflare to Microsoft 365

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.yml)** if you don't find what you're looking for.

If Cloudflare is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.

## Before you begin

You have two options for setting up DNS records for your domain:

- [**Use Domain Connect**](#use-domain-connect-to-verify-and-set-up-your-domain) If you haven't set up your domain with another email service provider, use the Domain Connect steps to automatically verify and set up your new domain to use with Microsoft 365.

    OR

- [**Use the manual steps**](#create-dns-records-with-manual-setup) Verify your domain using the manual steps below and choose when and which records to add to your domain registrar. This allows you to set up new MX (mail) records, for example, at your convenience.

## Use Domain Connect to verify and set up your domain

Follow these steps to automatically verify and set up your Cloudflare domain with Microsoft 365:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>, and select the domain you want to set up.

1. Select the three dots (more actions) \> choose **Start setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. On the How do you want to connect your domain? page, select **Continue**.

1. On the Add DNS records page, select **Add DNS records**.

1. On the Cloudflare login page, sign in to your account, and select **Authorize**.

    This completes your domain setup for Microsoft 365.

## Create DNS records with manual setup

After you add these records at Cloudflare, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft 365 services.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

### Change your domain's nameserver (NS) records

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must perform this procedure at the domain registrar where you purchased and registered your domain.

When you signed up for Cloudflare, you added a domain by using the Cloudflare Setup process.

The domain that you added was purchased from Cloudflare or a separate domain registrar. To verify and create DNS records for your domain in Microsoft 365, you first need to change the nameservers at your domain registrar so that they use the Cloudflare nameservers.

To change your domain's name servers at your domain registrar's website yourself, follow these steps.

1. Find the area on the domain registrar's website where you can edit the nameservers for your domain.

2. Either create two nameserver records by using the values in the following table, or edit the existing nameserver records so that they match these values.

    |Type|Value|
    |---|---|
    |First nameserver|Use the nameserver value provided by Cloudflare.|
    |Second nameserver|Use the nameserver value provided by Cloudflare.|

    > [!TIP]
    > You should use at least two name server records. If there are any other name servers listed, you should delete them.

3. Save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Your nameserver record updates may take up to several hours to update across the Internet's DNS system. Then your Microsoft email and other services will be all set to work with your domain.

### Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Cloudflare by using [this link](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/login). You'll be prompted to log in first.

1. On the Home page, select the domain that you want to update.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select the domain you want to update.":::

1. On the Overview page for your domain, select **DNS**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-2.png" alt-text="Select DNS.":::

1. On the DNS management page, select **+Add record**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-add-record.png" alt-text="Select Add record.":::

1. Select the TXT type from the drop-down list, and type or copy and paste the values from this table.

    |Type|Name|TTL|Content|
    |---|---|---|:----|
    |TXT|@|30 minutes|MS=ms*XXXXXXXX* <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)|

1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-TXT-save.png" alt-text="Select Add record.":::

   Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.

Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and search for the record. When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in Microsoft 365:

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818" target="_blank">**Domains**</a>.

1. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select **Start setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. On the **Verify domain** page, select **Verify**.

> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

### Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft 365. Instead, add the required Microsoft 365 values to the current record so that you have a *single* SPF record that includes both sets of values.

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Cloudflare by using [this link](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/login). You'll be prompted to log in first.

1. On the Home page, select the domain that you want to update.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select the domain you want to update.":::

1. On the Overview page for your domain, select **DNS**.

    |---|---|---|---|
    |TXT|@|30 minutes|v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all <br/> **Note:** We recommend copying and pasting this entry, so that all of the spacing stays correct.|

1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-cloudflare/cloudflare-domains-TXT-save.png" alt-text="Select Save.":::

## Advanced option: Skype for Business
