# What's next for the Microsoft 365 admin center

Welcome to **What's next for the Microsoft 365 admin center**! We’ve heard that you would like to know more about what’s coming to the Microsoft 365 admin center, so we are providing you a handy view - specific to your admin experience. You can also use the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap) and the [Message center](manage/stay-on-top-of-updates.md) to stay informed. 

> [!WARNING]
> The information contained in this article pertains only to the Microsoft 365 admin center and is not a promise of future functionality nor do we promise that the feature will be released in the time frame we've indicated. In addition, this information is not a complete list of all features being released. This article might be discontinued or deleted at any time.

## How to use this article

We're looking forward to hearing from you and we'd like to use this article as a conversation starter between us - the admin and the engineering team. Every item listed in the "In the works" section has a link to our [Office UserVoice](https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin) website, where we want you to vote for items that you're excited about, ask questions, and give us feedback.

## Released

For the list of features we've released for the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [What's new in the Microsoft 365 admin center](whats-new-in-preview.md).

## In the works

Here's a list of features that will most-likely be released soon.

### Role-based permissions

We're making it easier to see the roles that are assigned to a user and to see which users are assigned to a role:
- To see the roles assigned to a user, go to **Users** > **Active users** > select a user > **Manage roles**.
- To see the users assigned to a role, go to **Roles** > **Roles** > select a role > **Assigned admins**. And if you're not getting enough information from this view, you can go back to the Roles list page and export the list of admins and the roles assigned to them. Exporting the CSV file is great for auditing.
- You can also select a role as a **favorite**, so that you can sort and filter your most-used roles.<br>

### Keyboard shortcuts

You'll be able to perform some of the most common admin center tasks with just your keyboard. Here's an example of some of the keyboard shortcuts that are coming:
	
- **Shift+A+G**:  add group
- **Shift+A+U**: add user
- **Shift+A+C**: add contact
- **Shift+R+P**: reset password
