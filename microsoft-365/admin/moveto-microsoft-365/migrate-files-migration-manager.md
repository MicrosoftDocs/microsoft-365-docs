You can use the SharePoint Migration Manager to move files from personal and shared Drives. This video and summary of the required steps gives you an overview of how to do this. For more information, see [**Migrate Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager**](/sharepointmigration/mm-google-overview).
