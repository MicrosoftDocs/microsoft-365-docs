# Change your contact preferences for communications from Microsoft

Use the **Contact preferences** page to update your organizations's contact information, and choose the Microsoft 365 product-related communications that you want to receive.
  
Read [Update your admin phone number and email address in Microsoft 365](update-phone-number-and-email-address.md) for info on how to change your admin cellular phone number and email address.
  
If you're looking for how to change company profile information, such as organization's name and address, primary company phone number, and technical contact information, see [Change your organization's address, technical contact email, and other information](change-address-contact-and-more.md).
  
## To update your information
  
1. In the admin center, select the **Settings** icon in the top right of the header.

2. Select **Contact preferences**.

3. Choose the types of product-related communications you want to receive.

4. Type the business phone, business mobile phone, or business email where you want to receive these communications.
    You can use any email address, including your Microsoft email address, to receive these communications. If you don't add an email address for contact preferences, your alternate email address (on the **Personal info** page) will be used.

5. Choose **Save**.
  
For Office 365 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, and Microsoft 365 Business Basic, when you first signed up as an admin for Microsoft 365, depending on the country or region of the users in your organization, your users might be automatically signed up to receive product-related communications.
