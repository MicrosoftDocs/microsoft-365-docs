# Assign licenses to users

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

> [!NOTE]
> The admin center is changing. If your experience doesn't match the details presented here, see 
[About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md?preserve-view=true&view=o365-21vianet).

You can assign licenses to users on either the **Active users** page, or on the **Licenses** page. The method you use depends on whether you want to assign product licenses to specific users or assign users licenses to a specific product.

[Learn how to add a user and assign a license at the same time](../add-users/add-users.md).

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- You can [assign licenses to user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](../../enterprise/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).
- To use group-based licensing, see [Assign licenses to users by group membership in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign)
- Some services, like Sway, are automatically assigned to users, and don't need to be assigned individually.

## Use the Licenses page to assign licenses to users

When you use the **Licenses** page to assign licenses, you assign licenses for a specific product to up to 20 users. On the **Licenses** page, you see a list of all the products that you have subscriptions for. You also see the total number of licenses for each product, how many licenses are assigned, and how many are available.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page.
2. Select a product.
3. On the product details page, select **Assign licenses**.
4. In the **Assign licenses to users** pane, begin typing a name, and then choose it from the results to add it to the list. You can add up to 20 users at a time.
5. Select **Turn apps and services on or off** to assign or remove access to specific items.
6. When you're finished, select **Assign**, then select **Close**.

If there's a conflict, a message displays, tells you what the problem is, and tells you how to fix it. For example, if you selected licenses that contain conflicting services, the error message says to review the services included with each license and try again.

## Change the apps and services a user has access to

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page.
2. On the **Licenses** page, select the row for a specific user.
3. In the right pane, select or deselect the apps and services that you want to give access to or remove access from.
4. When you're finished, select **Save**, then select **Close**.
