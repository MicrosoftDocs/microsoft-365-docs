# Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to users

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

You can assign licenses to users on either the **Active users** page, or on the **Licenses** page. The method you use depends on whether you want to assign product licenses to specific users or assign users licenses to a specific product.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - As an admin, you can't assign or unassign licenses for a self-service purchase subscription bought by a user in your organization. You can [take over a purchase or trial subscription](../../commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins.md#take-over-a-purchase-or-trial-subscription), and then assign or unassign licenses.
> - For some subscriptions, you can only cancel during a limited window of time after you buy or renew your subscription. If the cancellation window has passed, turn off recurring billing to cancel the subscription at the end of its term.

[Learn how to add a user and assign a license at the same time](../add-users/add-users.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this topic, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- You can [assign Microsoft 365 licenses to user accounts with PowerShell](../../enterprise/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).
- To use group-based licensing, see [Assign licenses to users by group membership in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign)
- Some services, like Sway, are automatically assigned to users, and don't need to be assigned individually.
- If you're a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you bought products on behalf of a customer, you can't use the **Your products** page to assign or unassign licenses for certain products, like perpetual software. To assign or unassign licenses for those products, [use the Licenses page](#use-the-licenses-page-to-assign-licenses-to-users).

## Use the Licenses page to assign licenses to users

The **Licenses** page lets you assign or unassign licenses for up to 20 users at a time. The page shows the products you own, the number of available licenses for each product, and the number of assigned licenses out of the total licenses available.

The **Licenses** page shows an aggregate total of licenses for all subscriptions for the same product name. For example, you might have one subscription for Microsoft 365 Business Premium that has five licenses, and another subscription that has eight licenses for the same product. The **Licenses** page shows that you have a total of 13 licenses for Microsoft 365 Business Premium across all your subscriptions. This number is different from what you see on the **Your products** page, which displays a row for each subscription you own, even if they are for the same product.
