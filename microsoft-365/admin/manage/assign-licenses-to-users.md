# Assign licenses to users

You can assign licenses to users on either the **Active users** page, or on the **Licenses** page. The method you use depends on whether you want to assign product licenses to specific users or assign users licenses to a specific product.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - As an admin, you can't assign or unassign licenses for a self-service purchase subscription bought by a user in your organization. You can [take over a self-service purchase subscription](../../commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins.md#take-over-a-self-service-purchase-subscription), and then assign or unassign licenses.
> - For some subscriptions, you can only cancel during a limited window of time after you buy or renew your subscription. If the cancellation window has passed, turn off recurring billing to cancel the subscription at the end of its term.

[Learn how to add a user and assign a license at the same time](../add-users/add-users.md).

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- You can [assign Microsoft 365 licenses to user accounts with PowerShell](../../enterprise/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell.md).
- To use group-based licensing, see [Assign licenses to users by group membership in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign)
- Some services, like Sway, are automatically assigned to users, and don't need to be assigned individually.


## Use the Licenses page to assign licenses to users

When you use the **Licenses** page to assign licenses, you assign licenses for a specific product to up to 20 users. On the **Licenses** page, you see a list of all the products that you have subscriptions for. You also see the total number of licenses for each product, how many licenses are assigned, and how many are available.
