# Show or hide new features using What's New Management

Office What's New Management for Win 32 allows your organization to decide which features are shown to or hidden from end users in the Office desktop app. Each release of Office includes new and improved features, and the content preview allows you to view new content for each release version and channel, and choose whether to hide or show What's new content for each feature to end users. 

The What's new content in the Office desktop apps highlights a curated list of new features being released for that application, with a short description, and often a picture or a video created by the team releasing the feature to help customers learn how to use the feature. 

> [!NOTE]
> Global admin and Office Apps admin roles manage the What's new content that users see in their Office apps.

##  Show or hide new features 

Admins can preview the What's new content for a channel, and manage the release of the content using Office What's New Management.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, choose **Settings**.

2. On the **Services** tab, choose **Office What's New Management**.

3. Select one or more features to view the feature name, a short description, the application, and the release version for each feature on the flyout panel.

4. Choose **Hide from users** or **Show to users**.  

    The status **Shown by default** indicates feature information is shown by default to users until the admin sets the status for a feature to **Hidden** or **Shown**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a feature is available in multiple Office apps, setting the feature to hidden hides the feature announcement in all of the Office apps.
