# Add-in deployment email alerts

When you deploy Office Add-ins from the Integrated Apps page, you can now notify the assigned users about the newly deployed add-in by email. To send out the email notification, you need to consent to sending the email notification at the time of add-in deployment or user assignment updates.

As of now, email notifications can be sent for deployment of Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word add-ins. Moreover, these emails are only for add-in assignments to specific users and groups.

The following sections provide more information about what the email alert would look like for the users the add-in is deployed to.
