# Find your partner or reseller

As an admin, you can work with a partner to purchase, activate, and renew Microsoft 365 subscriptions through a Microsoft Open Volume Licensing program. 
  
 **Not sure if Open Volume Licensing is for you?** Check out the [Microsoft Open Programs overview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613298).
  
## Find a new partner or reseller

If you're ready to buy or renew Microsoft 365 through Open Volume Licensing, or you simply want more information about working with a partner, choose an option below. 
  
- [Search for a partner using Microsoft PinPoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613304)
    
- [Call Microsoft Volume Licensing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613305)
    
## Find contact information for a partner you've worked with in the past

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, you can find information in the Microsoft 365 admin center for partners you've worked with in the past. Keep in mind that this information may be out of date. As a best practice, we recommend contacting the person or department responsible for purchasing in your organization to find out which partner you should work with. 
  
## Get partner info in the admin center

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074649" target="_blank">Partner relationships</a> page.
  
2. If you have a partner, the partner's name and relationship to your organization will be listed here. To view partner contact information (phone number and email address), select the partner name.
