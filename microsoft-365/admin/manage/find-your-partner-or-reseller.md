# Find your Microsoft 365 subscriptions partner or reseller

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2224585).

As an admin, you can work with a partner to buy, activate, and renew Microsoft 365 subscriptions through one of our Volume Licensing programs.
  
## Before you begin

You must be a Global admin to do the tasks described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Find a new partner or reseller

If you're ready to buy or renew Microsoft 365 through Open Volume Licensing, or you simply want more information about working with a partner, choose one of the following options.
  
- [Search for a Microsoft-certified service partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613304)
- [Call Microsoft Volume Licensing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613305)

## Find contact information for a partner you worked with previously

In some cases, you can find information in the Microsoft 365 admin center for partners you worked with previously. Keep in mind that this information might be out of date. We recommend that you contact the person or department responsible for purchasing in your organization to find out which partner you should work with.

## View partner info in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, go to the **Settings** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074649" target="_blank">Partner relationships</a> page.
2. If you have a partner, the partner's name and relationship to your organization is listed here. To view partner contact information, like the phone number and email address, select the partner name.
