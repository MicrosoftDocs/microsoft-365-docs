# Move users to a different subscription

> [!NOTE]
> The admin center is changing. If your experience doesn't match the details presented here, see

Do you have more than one subscription? If you have users who already have a license for one subscription, you can move them to another subscription. To do this, replace their existing license with a different one.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global admin, or User management admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Next steps

If you’re not going to [reassign the unused licenses to other users](../../managed-desktop/get-started/assign-licenses.md), consider [removing the licenses from your subscription](../../commerce/licenses/buy-licenses.md) so that you’re not paying for more licenses than you need.
