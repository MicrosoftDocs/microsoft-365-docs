# Change your organization's address and technical contact in the Microsoft 365 admin center
  
As an admin, you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to make changes to your organization profile, like your organization name, address, phone number, and technical contact.
  
To change the address associated with your bill or subscription, see [Change your billing addresses for Microsoft 365 for business](../../commerce/billing-and-payments/change-your-billing-addresses.md).

## Before you begin

You must be a Global Administrator to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

[!INCLUDE [ga-roles-limitation](../../includes/ga-roles-limitation.md)]

## Edit your organization's information

You can change most of your organization’s profile information in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Change your organization’s name

The steps to change your organization’s name depend on the type of billing account that you have. [Find out what type of billing account you have](../../commerce/manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).

- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you can’t change your organization’s name without assistance. [Complete this form](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102732), then contact support to get help with changing your organization’s name.

- If you have a Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA) billing account type, you can change your organization’s name in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To change your organization’s name, follow the steps in [Edit organization information](#edit-organization-information).

### Change your country/region

You can't change the country/region for your subscription. The country/region where your organization is headquartered determines which services are available to you, the taxes and billing currency, and the location of the data center. To change your organization's country/region, sign up for a new account, choose the desired country or region, and buy a new subscription.

### Edit organization information

To change information on your organization's profile page, use the following steps.
  
1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
2. In the **Navigation menu**, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743" target="_blank">**Org settings**</a> page.
3. Select the **Organization profile** tab, select **Organization information**.
4. Update your organization's information, then select **Save**. You must fill in all required fields marked with an asterisk (*) before you can save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint Online and OneDrive have a 256-character limit on Windows PCs. If you exceed the character limit, you receive an error message when you try to do anything within the synchronized document libraries, like creating folders or renaming documents.

## What do the organization information fields mean?

The following table explains the fields shown in the **Organization information** pane.

| Field | Description |
|---------|---------|
|Name  | The organization's name that's used to identify it.  |
|Address, City, State/Province, ZIP/Postal code   | The address entered is shown on your invoice under **Sold To**. The Sold To address is the same as your organization address on your profile page.    |
|Country or region   | The country/region where the organization is headquartered. The selected country/region determines which services are available to you, the taxes and billing currency for your country/region, and the location of the data center closest to you. To find out whether a country/region is supported, see [About license restrictions](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-office-license-restrictions).<br/><br/>**NOTE:** After you select a country/region, it can't be changed. If you need to change the selection, you must cancel your subscription and sign up again. For help with this process, [contact support](../get-help-support.md).        |
|Phone   | The primary telephone number for your organization. It's usually the number of your organization headquarters.  |
|Technical contact | The email address for the primary technical person who administers your subscription. This person receives communications about Microsoft service status. |
|Preferred language | Determines the language for all communications that are sent from Microsoft to your organization. When you sign up, this setting determines the language used by SharePoint Online, that your users see on your team site. If you change the language preference setting after you sign up, all future communications are sent in the most recent language selected.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** The language used by SharePoint Online can't be changed.           |

## Change organization settings for Cloud PCs

By default, new Cloud PCs are created with the Windows 11 operating system and the Standard User account type. To change these default settings, use the following steps.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the **Navigation menu**, go to the **Settings** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743" target="_blank">**Org settings**</a> page.
2. On the **Services** tab, select **Windows 365**.
3. Select your preferred operating system and account type, then select **Save**.

Organization settings only apply to newly created Cloud PCs. When these settings are changed, they don't change the OS or account type of existing Cloud PCs.
