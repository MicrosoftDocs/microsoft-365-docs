# Teams apps that only work on Teams

In addition to the controls available to you in the Integrated Apps portal, admins can also block or unblock Teams apps that only work on Teams. Such apps have a manifest version less than 1.13. These apps can be identified by the availability status **Some or all users in the organization can install** in the **Available Apps** list. At this time, only blocking and unblocking of such an app is supported via the Integrated Apps portal.

## Before you begin

- These apps only show up on the Available Apps list based on your settings in Teams admin center. Verify if your settings in the Teams admin center are for 3P apps.
    - If access to 3P apps on Teams admin center is turned on, admins can start seeing these apps on the **Integrated apps portal** in **Available apps** and **Blocked apps** lists based on their setting in Teams admin center.
    - If access to 3P apps on Teams admin center is turned off, no such apps are visible on the Integrated apps portal.
- These apps always have the availability status of **Some or all users in the organization can install**. These apps always have only Teams as the host product. To know more about which users can access this app on Teams, visit the Teams admin center.
