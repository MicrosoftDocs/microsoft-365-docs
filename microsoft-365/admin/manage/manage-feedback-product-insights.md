# Microsoft product NPS feedback and insights for your organization

As the admin of a Microsoft 365 organization, you can access and obtain insights from NPS product surveys sent by Microsoft.  

Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys gather user feedback and measure how likely users say they are to recommend products and services to friends and colleagues. This data can be used at your organization to determine strategies for adoption and rollout of Microsoft 365 products and services.

We use NPS surveys and feedback from your end-users to provide you with insights about Microsoft products and services. This information can help you find out about what products and services end-users in your organization are using, as well as help you identify issues and quickly resolve them. With this information you can:

- Access to the top themes users are discussing.
- Identify happy users.
- Address complaints from unhappy users.
- See what operating system or platform people are using.
- Filter by product, platform, channel, or search using keywords.
- See end-user comments on the top products and issues.
- Export feedback and survey information to a CSV file.

### Top topic filters

We've identified the common themes from user feedback. Then we used machine learning models that train the data sets and automatically organize the feedback into **Top Topics**. You can then identify the top five topics with the most volume of verbatim feedback.

### Filters

You can filter by **Channels**, **Products**, **Platforms** and **Feedback Types**.

**Channels** are a way for organizations to select how often they get feature updates for Microsoft 365. Learn more at [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 apps](/deployoffice/overview-update-channels). This filter allows you to filter down to feedback submitted from a user on a specific channel.

Feedback can be submitted on various **Platforms** like Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows. This filter allows you to filter feedback based on the platform it was submitted on.

The majority of Microsoft 365 for business **Products** can be found under this filter. Use this filter to select the products that have had feedback submitted.

Use **Feedback Types** (set only to NPS feedback types) to filter feedback that we collect.
