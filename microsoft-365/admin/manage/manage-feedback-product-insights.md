# Microsoft product NPS feedback and insights for your organization

As the admin of a Microsoft 365 organization, you can now see insights and data generated by users in your organization.

Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys gather user feedback and measure how likely users say they are to recommend products and services to friends and colleagues. This data can be used at the organizational level to determine strategies for adoption and rollout.

We use NPS surveys and feedback from your end-users to provide you with insights about Microsoft products and services. This information can help you find out about what products and services end-users in your organization are using, as well as help you identify issues and quickly resolve them. With this information you can:

<!--See location of users who have submitted feedback-->
- See what operating system or platform they're using
- Filter on product, platform and search using keywords
- See end-user comments on the top products and issues
- Export feedback and survey information to a CSV file for further investigation

## Before you begin
