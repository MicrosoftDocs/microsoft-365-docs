# Manage messages in Message center

Message center posts are important announcements about new and changed features. This article provides more information about the things you can do with messages to help with change management in your organization.
  
## Read a message

To go to the Message center, go to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), and select **Health** > **Message center**.

Select a message title to open it in the reading pane. Every message contains a summary of the change, a statement of how the change may affect you, information about how you can prepare your organization for the change, and (in most cases) an additional information link where you can learn more. The additional information continues to be available, even after a message expires.

## Filter and sort

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

Use the **Service**, **Tag**, and **Message state**  drop-down menus to select a filtered view of messages. For example, in this diagram the messages are tagged with the **Admin impact** tag.

You can select any column heading, except **Service** and **Tag**,  to sort messages in ascending or descending order.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/message-center-admin-impact1.png" alt-text="Message center view sorted by Admin impact":::

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-germany"

Use the **Views** drop-down menu to select a filtered view of messages.

You can select any column heading to sort messages in ascending or descending order. For example, in this illustration the messages are sorted on the **Act by** date.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

Use the **Service**, **Tag**, and **Message state**  drop-down menus to select a filtered view of messages. For example, in this diagram the messages are tagged with the **Admin impact**.

You can select any column heading, except **Service** and **Tags**,  to sort messages in ascending or descending order.

::: moniker-end

## Give feedback on a post

In the Message center, you can select a message to see details.

If you want to provide feedback on the message, in the details pane, select either the **Like** or **Dislike** icon on the bottom of the message details pane, and provide optional feedback in the text box that appears. Do not provide any personal information. You can optionally select **It's OK to contact me about this feedback** and then select **Send**.

## Share a message

See a message that someone else needs to act on? You can share the contents of the message with any user by email:
  
1. Select the message to open it, and then select **Share**.
  
2. To share the message, enter up to two email addresses separated by a colon. You can send to individual and to group email addresses. Optionally, you can choose to receive a copy of the message in email (the message will go to your primary email address) or add a personal message to provide recipients with more context.
  
3. Select **Share** to send the email.

## Get a link

Need to follow up with another admin to make sure they're aware of a change and taking action? You can generate a link to share in email or instant messaging, for example, that will connect the user directly to that message. The person you share the link with has to have access to Message center. See [admin roles that don't have access to the Message center](message-center.md#admin-roles-that-dont-have-access-to-the-message-center) for more information.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. Select the message to open it.

2. Select **Copy link**.

3. Use Ctrl+V or right-click and select **Paste** to insert the link to whatever document you wish.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-germany"

1. Select the message to open it.

2. Choose **More** \> **Get a link** from the action bar.

3. Allow the webpage to access your Clipboard. A direct link is copied to your Clipboard.

4. Use Ctrl+V or right-click and select **Paste** to insert the link.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

1. Select the message to open it.

2. Select **Copy link**.

3. Use Ctrl+V or right-click and select **Paste** to insert the link to whatever document you wish.

::: moniker-end

## Read and unread states

Any message in Message center that is unread will appear in bold. Opening a message marks it as read. You can mark a message as unread.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

- On the main page of the message center, select the **More options** ellipses next to a message, and then select **Mark as unread**.

You can also open a message and mark it as unread in the details panel.
  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-germany"

1. Select the message to open it.

2. Select **More** \> **Mark as unread**.

3. Close the message.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

- On the main page of the message center, select the **More options** ellipses next to a message, and then select **Mark as unread**.

::: moniker-end

## Archive and restore

If you see a message that doesn't pertain to you, or maybe you've already acted on it, you can archive the message to remove it from Inbox. The view that you see in the Message center is specific to your user account, so archiving it from your view doesn't affect other admins. There are two ways to archive a message.

- On the main page of the Message center, select a message, and then select **Archive** above the list of messages.

- Open the message, and then select **Archive** on the top of the message pane.

Need to get an archived message back? No problem.
  
1. Select the **Archive** tab at the top of the Message center. A list of archived messages appears.

2. Select the message, select **Restore**, and the message is restored to Inbox.

## Favorite messages

To mark a message as a favorite, hover over the message title and you will see a **Favorite** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/favorite-star.png" border="false"::: star you can select right after the **More options** ellipses. Once you have marked messages as favorite you can also sort and filter them.

## Scroll messages in the message pane

When you open a message in a reading pane, you can use the **Up** and **Down** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/updownarrows.png" border="false"::: arrows on the top of the pane to move to the next, or the previous message in the list.

## Track your message center tasks in Planner

A lot of actionable information about changes to Microsoft 365 services arrives in the Microsoft 365 message center. It can be difficult to keep track of which changes require tasks to be done, when, and by whom, and to track each task to completion. You also might want to make a note of something and tag it to check on later. You can do all this and more when you sync your messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center to Microsoft Planner. For more information, see [Track your message center tasks in Planner](/office365/planner/track-message-center-tasks-planner).
