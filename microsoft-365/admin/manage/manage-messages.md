# Manage messages in Message center

Message center posts are important announcements about new and changed features. This article provides more information about the things you can do with messages to help with change management in your organization.
  
## Read a message

To go to the Message center, go to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), and select **Health** > **Message center**. 

Select a message title to open it in the reading pane. Every message contains a summary of the change, a statement of how the change may affect you, information about how you can prepare your organization for the change, and (in most cases) an additional information link where you can learn more. The additional information continues to be available, even after a message expires.

## Filter and sort

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

Use the **Filter** drop-down menu to select a filtered view of messages.

You can select any column heading to sort messages in ascending or descending order. For example, in this diagram the messages are sorted on the **Act by** date.

## Give feedback on a post

In the Message center, you can select a message to see details.

If you want to provide feedback on the message, select either the **Like** or **Dislike** icon and provide feedback in the text box that appears. Do not provide any personal information. You can optionally select **It's OK to contact me about this feedback** and then select **Send**.

## Share a message

See a message that someone else needs to act on? You can share the contents of the message with any user by email:
  
1. Select the message to open it, and then select **Share**.
  
2. To share the message, enter up to two email addresses separated by a colon. You can send to individual and to group email addresses. Optionally, you can choose to receive a copy of the message in email (the message will go to your primary email address) or add a personal message to provide recipients with more context.
  
3. Select **Share** to send the email.
    
## Get a link

Need to follow up with another admin to make sure they're aware of a change and taking action? You can generate a link to share in email or instant messaging, for example, that will connect the user directly to that message. The person you share the link with has to be an admin in Microsoft 365 for your organization or they won't have access to the linked message.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

1. Select the message to open it.

2. Select the **Copy link to Clipboard** (link) icon.

## Archive and restore

If you see a message that doesn't pertain to you, or maybe you've already acted on it, you can archive the message to remove it from the Message center view. The view that you see in the Message center is specific to your user account, so archiving it from your view doesn't affect other admins.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

- On the main page of the Message center, select a message, and then select **Archive** above the list of messages.

- Open the message, and then select **Archive** at the bottom of the message.

Need to get a archived message back? No problem.
  
1. Select the **Archived messages** tab at the top of the Message center. A list of archived messages appears. 

2. Select the message, select **Restore**, and the message is restored to active messages.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-germany"

There are two ways to archive a message.
  
- Select the X that appears to the right of the Message ID. The message is removed from your list. Or,

- Open the message, and then select **Archive** at the top of the message.

Need to get a dismissed message back? No problem.
  
1. Select the **Archived messages** filter from the **Views** drop-down menu. A list of archived messages appears.

2. Select **Restore** to the right of the Message ID, and the message is restored to active messages.

## Track your message center tasks in Planner

A lot of actionable information about changes to Microsoft 365 services arrives in the Microsoft 365 message center. It can be difficult to keep track of which changes require tasks to be done, when, and by whom, and to track each task to completion. You also might want to make a note of something and tag it to check on later. You can do all this and more when you sync your messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center to Microsoft Planner. For more information, see [Track your message center tasks in Planner](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/planner/track-message-center-tasks-planner).


For an overview of Message center, see [Message center in Microsoft 365](message-center.md). Or, to learn how to set your language preferences to enable machine translation for Message center posts, see [Language translation for Message center posts](language-translation-for-message-center-posts.md). If you'd like to program an alternative way to get real-time service health information and Message Center communications, please reference [Microsoft 365 Service Communications API Overview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848507).
