# Get started with Integrated apps

## What is Integrated Apps

Integrated Apps gives you the flexibility to deploy and manage single store apps, bundled apps, and a custom business line of apps from a single location. These apps can be built by Microsoft or by our 3P Microsoft 365 partners. The ability to find, test, and fully deploy purchased and licensed apps by Microsoft partners from the Integrated apps portal provides the convenience and benefits your organization requires to keep business services updated regularly and running efficiently.

The Integrated apps portal displays a list of apps that can be accessed by users in your organization. The following apps can be managed via Integrated Apps:

- Office Add-ins
- Teams apps that work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app (formerly known as Office.com). 
- Teams Apps that only work on Teams.
- SPFx apps
- Web apps: For web apps, you can see two kinds of apps.
    - SaaS apps that are available in appsource.microsoft.com and can be deployed by admins giving consent on behalf of the organization.
    - SAML gallery apps that are linked with Office add-ins.

## How to access Integrated Apps

Integrated Apps can be accessed via the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Select **Settings**, and then choose **Integrated apps**.

## Who can access Integrated Apps

The Integrated apps portal is available to world-wide customers only and can be accessed by Global Admins, Global Readers, Exchange admins, and Azure Application Admins (made available in May 2023). This feature is not available in sovereign and government clouds.

To learn more about these roles, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles - Microsoft Entra|Microsoft Learn](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#all-roles).

## User and group assignments

We currently support most groups supported by Microsoft Entra ID, including Microsoft 365 groups, distribution lists, and security groups. We support users in top-level groups or groups without parent groups, but not users in nested groups or groups that have parent groups. To know more, read the documentation on [Assign users and groups to application](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal?pivots=portal).

> [!NOTE]
> Non-mail enabled security groups are not currently supported.

In the following example, Sandra, Sheila, and the Sales Department group are assigned to an app or add-in. Because the West Coast Sales Department is a nested group, Bert and Fred aren't assigned to an app or add-in.

### Find out if a group contains nested groups

The easiest way to detect if a group contains nested groups is to view the group contact card within Outlook. If you enter the group name within the **To** field of an email and then select the group name when it resolves, it will show you if it contains users or nested groups. In the example below, the **Members** tab of the Outlook contact card for the Test Group shows no users and only two sub groups.

You can do the opposite query by resolving the group to see if it's a member of any group. In the example below, you can see under the **Membership** tab of the Outlook contact card that Sub Group 1 is a member of the Test Group.

Note that you can use the Azure Active Directory Graph API to run queries to find the list of groups within a group. For more information, see [Operations on groups | Graph API reference](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/api/groups-operations).
