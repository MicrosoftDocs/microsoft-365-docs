If your application requires successful communication with external systems, outline how to test the connection to ensure a successful configuration.

Follow these steps to test the configuration of Microsoft 365 support integration:

2. Open any incident.

3. Focus on the **Microsoft 365 Support** tab and select **Microsoft 365 Insights** to determine if the recommended solutions were returned successfully.
