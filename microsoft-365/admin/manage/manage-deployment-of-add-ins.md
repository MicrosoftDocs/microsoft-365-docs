# Deploy add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Office Add-ins help you personalize your documents and streamline the way you access information on the web (see [Start using your Office Add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/office/82e665c4-6700-4b56-a3f3-ef5441996862)). As an admin, you can deploy Office Add-ins for the users in your organization by using the Centralized Deployment feature in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Centralized Deployment is the recommended and most feature-rich way for most admins to deploy add-ins to users and groups within an organization.

For more information on how to determine if your organization can support Centralized Deployment, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).

To learn more about managing add-ins after deployment, see [Manage add-ins in the admin center](manage-addins-in-the-admin-center.md)
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For Word, Excel and PowerPoint use a [SharePoint App Catalog](/office/dev/add-ins/publish/publish-task-pane-and-content-add-ins-to-an-add-in-catalog) to deploy add-ins to users in an on-premises environment with no connection to Microsoft 365 and/or support for SharePoint add-ins required. For Outlook use Exchange control panel to deploy in an on-premises environment without a connection to Microsoft 365.
  
## Recommended approach for deploying Office Add-ins

To roll out add-ins by using a phased approach, we recommend the following:
  
1. Roll out the add-in to a small set of business stakeholders and members of the IT department. If the deployment is successful, move to step 2.
    
2. Roll out the add-in to more individuals within the business. Again, evaluate the results and, if successful, continue with full deployment.
    
3. Perform a full rollout to all users.
    
Depending on the size of the target audience, you can add or remove roll-out steps.
  
## Deploy an Office Add-in using the admin center

Before you begin, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md).
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Add-ins** page. If you don't see the **Add-in** Page, go to the **Settings** \> **Integrated apps** \> **Add-ins** page.

2. Select **Deploy Add-in** at the top of the page, and then select **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also deploy add-ins in the admin center through [Integrated Apps](test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps.md). Integrated Apps is visible to Global and Exchange administrators. If you don't see the above steps, go to the Centralized Deployment section by going to **Settings** > **Integrated apps**. On the top of the **Integrated apps** page, choose **Add-ins**.

3. Select an option and follow the instructions.
  
4. If you selected the option to add an add-in from the Office Store, make your add-in selection. </br>

    You can view available add-ins by categories: **Suggested for you**, **Rating**, or **Name**. Only free add-ins are available from the Office Store. Paid add-ins aren't supported currently. After you select an add-in, accept the terms and conditions to proceed. <br/> 

    > [!NOTE]
    > With the Office Store option, updates and enhancements are automatically deployed to users.

5. On the next page, select **Everyone**, **Specific users/groups**, or **Just me** to specify who the add-in is deployed to. Use the Search box to find specific users or groups. <br/>

    > [!NOTE]
    > To learn about other states that apply to an add-in, see [Add-in states](./manage-addins-in-the-admin-center.md).
  
6. Select **Deploy**.
  
7. A green tick appears when the add-in is deployed. Follow the on-page instructions to test the add-in.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users might need to relaunch Office to view the add-in icon on the app ribbon. Outlook add-ins can take up to 24 hours to appear on app ribbons.

8. When finished, select **Next**. If you've deployed to just yourself, you can select **Change who has access to add-in** to deploy to more users.

    If you've deployed the add-in to other members of your organization, follow the instructions to announce the deployment of the add-in. <br/>
  
    It's good practice to inform users and groups that the deployed add-in is available. Consider sending an email that describes when and how to use the add-in. Include or link to Help content or FAQs that might help users if they have problems with the add-in.
  
### Considerations when assigning an add-in to users and groups

Global admins and Exchange admins can assign an add-in to everyone or to specific users and groups. Each option has implications:
  
- **Everyone** This option assigns the add-in to every user in the organization. Use this option sparingly and only for add-ins that are truly universal to your organization.

- **Users** If you assign an add-in to an individual user, and then deploy the add-in to a new user, you must first add the new user.

- **Groups** If you assign an add-in to a group, users who are added to the group are automatically assigned the add-in. When a user is removed from a group, the user loses access to the add-in. In either case, no additional action is required from the admin.

- **Just me** If you assign an add-in to just yourself, the add-in is assigned to only your account, which is ideal for testing the add-in.

The right option for your organization depends on your configuration. However, we recommend making assignments by using groups. As an admin, you might find it easier to manage add-ins by using groups and controlling the membership of those groups rather than assigning individual users each time. In some situations, you might want to restrict access to a small set of users by making assignments to specific users by assigning users manually.
  
## More about Office Add-ins security

Office Add-ins combine an XML manifest file that contains some metadata about the add-in, but most importantly points to a web application which contains all the code and logic. Add-ins can range in their capabilities. For example, add-ins can:
  
- Display data.

- Read a user's document to provide contextual services.

- Read and write data to and from a user's document to provide value to that user.

For more information about the types and capabilities of Office Add-ins, see [Office Add-ins platform overview](/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins), especially the section "Anatomy of an Office Add-in."
  
To interact with the user's document, the add-in needs to declare what permission it needs in the manifest. A five-level JavaScript API access-permissions model provides the basis for privacy and security for users of task pane add-ins. The majority of the add-ins in the Office Store are level ReadWriteDocument with almost all add-ins supporting at least the ReadDocument level. For more information about the permission levels, see [Requesting permissions for API use in content and task pane add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/requesting-permissions-for-api-use-in-content-and-task-pane-add-ins).
  
When updating a manifest, the typical changes are to an add-in's icon and text. Occasionally, add-in commands change. However, the permissions of the add-in do not change. The web application where all the code and logic for the add-in runs can change at any time, which is the nature of web applications.
  
Updates for add-ins happen as follows:
  
- **Line-of-business add-in:** In this case, where an admin explicitly uploaded a manifest, the add-in requires that the admin upload a new manifest file to support metadata changes. The next time the relevant Office applications start, the add-in will update. The web application can change at any time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Admin does not need to remove a LOB Add-in for doing an update.   In the Add-ins section, Admin can simply click on the LOB Add-in and choose the **Update Button** in the bottom right corner. Update will work only if the version of the new add-in is greater than that of the existing add-in.

- **Office Store add-in:** When an admin selected an add-in from the Office Store, if an add-in updates in the Office Store, the add-in will update later in Centralized Deployment. The next time the relevant Office applications start, the add-in will update. The web application can change at any time.
