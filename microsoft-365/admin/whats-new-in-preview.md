The **Suggested training** feature is part of the Experience Insights dashboard and gives you deeper insights into the Microsoft 365 help and training articles being read by your signed-in users on support.microsoft.com and in-app help panels with these 3 insights:

- **Top viewed articles** for your organization shows you help and training articles that have been getting the most views by people in your organization.

- **Trending across organizations** shows you the help and training topics that are moving up the most in your organizations most viewed list.

- **Commonly viewed together** gives you insights into the additional help articles users in all Microsoft 365 organizations are reading, along with the top viewed and top trending articles. You can use this info to put together and share training packages for your users.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/exp-insights-dashboard.png" alt-text="Experience insights dashboard":::

Use this data to decide which help articles and training resources to share with your users about these products and apps, or make sure your helpdesk is aware of these areas so they can answer any user questions. If your org doesn’t have enough views on help and training articles, you’ll see data from other Microsoft 365 organizations.

There are a couple of ways to get the Experience insights dashboard page:

- If you’re a member of the Global admin or Global reader roles, when you log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, you’ll see a one-time prompt to go to the Experience insights (preview) dashboard. You can access it at any time by selecting Experience insights (preview) from the admin home page.

- If you’re a member of the Reports reader role or the User Experience success manager roles, once you sign into the admin center, you’ll automatically go to the Experience insights (preview) dashboard page. You can switch back to the admin center Dashboard view by selecting that option in the top right.

### Sentiment per Topic available in the NPS survey insights dashboard

To empower IT Admins like you, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey insights dashboard released the new Sentiment per Topic feature under the sentiment section.

### NPS Sentiment Insights

NPS survey insights is an AI-driven dashboard available in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

In the admin center, go to **Health** > **Product feedback** > **NPS survey insights**.

This feature helps admins like you obtain actionable insights derived from Microsoft NPS surveys your users have responded to. Learn more at [Microsoft product NPS feedback and insights for your organization](manage/manage-feedback-product-insights.md).

Based on your feedback, we're introducing a new feature that identifies the sentiment for each NPS verbatim feedback, so that you can learn what your users are feeling regarding Microsoft 365 products. Sentiment labels such as **Positive**, **Negative** and **Other** are assigned to the NPS verbatim feedback.

:::image type="content" source="../media/product-feedback-nps-verbatims.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Product feedback dashboard on the NPS surveys insights tab":::

With the sentiment feature on the NPS survey insights dashboard you'll be able to:

- Visualize sentiment trend for the last 12 months based on the NPS verbatim feedback.

- Identify the sentiment per app and platform.

Three sentiments are available:

:::image type="content" source="../media/sentiment-examples.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Sentiment examples and descriptions. The sentiments available are positive, negative, and other. Each sentiment includes a description and an example. The description of positive is comments that contain satisfactory emotions or experiences. The example is I love how Word lets me check my grammar while drafting my documents." lightbox="../media/sentiment-examples.png":::

To provide you with a better experience using the NPS survey insight dashboard, we suggest checking the following items:

- Encourage your users to submit feedback.

- Confirm [in-product survey policies](https://config.office.com) are enabled.

- Improve diagnosability by enabling [Windows Error Reporting](/windows/win32/wer/windows-error-reporting).

### Microsoft 365 admin center search

You can now view all search results in a separate browser page by searching in global search and selecting **Enter**.

With our new separate page of search results, you can explore a more comprehensive list of results and easily return to the browser page for a more efficient search experience.

:::image type="content" source="../media/whats-new-search-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot: New Microsoft 365 admin center browser search page showing sections All, Navigation, Actions, Settings, Roles, and Documentation." lightbox="../media/whats-new-search-page.png":::

### Search in distribution lists to add Priority Accounts

Previously, you could only tag priority accounts by searching for them using the person's name, e-mail address or job title. With this update, you can now search for people to add to priority accounts in a distribution list. This allows you to bulk add people in an efficient way and reduces the time needed to tag individual people in your organization.

:::image type="content" source="../media/search-by-distribution-list-priority-accounts.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows the interface in which users can search for priority accounts to add using a distribution list." lightbox="../media/search-by-distribution-list-priority-accounts.png":::

- You can tag up to 50 users from a distribution list as priority accounts in a single action.

- Additional information about the user like department and job title has been introduced on the Priority Accounts page.

- You can only tag user accounts within distribution lists, and not the list itself. Users who have already been tagged won’t show up in your distribution list search.
