In the admin center, go to **Health** > **Product feedback** > **NPS survey insights**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/feedback-whatsnew.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Showing the Feedback page in the Microsoft 365 admin center":::

We've identified the common themes from user feedback. Then we used machine learning models techniques to train the data sets and automatically organize the feedback into Top Topics.

There are nine topics available. Look out for more topics in future updates.

:::image type="content" source="../media/feedback-nine-topics.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Showning the 9 new feedback topics":::

The NPS survey insight dashboard also contains these three new reports and pivots:

### Support ticket insight for Premier organizations

We've added 2 graphs called **Volume trend** and **Volume trend by product** to give you visual insights about your support volume.

The liner graph under **Volume trend** tab highlights the trend if support cases are increasing or decreasing for your organization month over month. You can hover on the graph to check the number of support cases created in each month.

:::image type="content" source="../media/SuppInsight-voltrnd.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot: Graph that highlights the trend if support cases are increasing or decreasing for your organization month over month":::

## Ignite 2021 (March)

Welcome to Microsoft Ignite. We hope you were able to attend some of one of our sessions: [Microsoft Ignite 2021](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions). Here's a few of the things we talked about at Ignite.
> [!NOTE]
> Not all features are going to be available to everyone right away. If you aren't seeing the new features, [join Targeted Release](manage/release-options-in-office-365.md).

### Message center

We’ve revamped the Message center to help you discover relevant messages and added a more flexible reading experience. We've added a new **Service** column to help you scan which Service a message applies to and filter messages by Service and other metadata. You can favorite a message to mark it for follow up, choose which columns appear in the message list, and navigate between messages with the back and next buttons. We've also improved the process to make it easier to give feedback on Message center posts.

:::image type="content" source="../media/message-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Message center home page showing inbox and messages":::

To learn more about the new features, check out [Message center](manage/message-center.md).

### What's new features

We've made improvements to how you view the "What's new" features for users in the Office apps. You can now see the rich content in the What's new pane that your users can see. You can also learn more about the feature before you decide to let your users know about the feature. For more info, check out [Manage which Office features appear in What's New](manage/show-hide-new-features.md).

:::image type="content" source="../media/power-bi-whats-new2.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Office apps what's new page showing improvements to Power BI":::

## Ignite 2020 (August & September)

Welcome to Microsoft Ignite - our first online-only Ignite. We hope to see you in one of our sessions: [Microsoft Ignite 2020 Session Catalog](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions). Here's just a few of the things we'll be talking about at Ignite.
> [!NOTE]
> Not all features are going to be available to everyone right away. If you aren't seeing the new features, [join Targeted Release](manage/release-options-in-office-365.md).

### Multi-tenant management

We've developed a set of features for multi-tenant admins like you to get your job done faster and more efficiently. For more information, see [Manage multiple tenants](multi-tenant/manage.md).

- **Your tenants**: Quickly switch between the tenants you manage.
- **All tenants**: A new page where you can quickly see the health of all your tenants' services, any open service requests, your products and billing, recommended setup tasks, and the number of users in that tenant.
- **Setup**: The multi-tenant Setup page gives you a list view of the Setup page, but organized for many tenants. You can see which features aren't turned on, which tasks are complete for all tenants, tasks that tenants still need to complete. This view will help you keep track of feature adoption and to make sure the recommended security setup tasks are always done.
- **Service health**: The service health view shows you if any incidents or advisories are affecting the tenants. It will even tell you how many of your managed tenants are affected. Just select an incident to get more information on the overview tab, then switch over to the Tenants affected tab to drill down and support that tenant.
- **Cross-tenant mailbox migrations** is a new service, now in public preview, that lets you move mailboxes between tenants without the need to offboard and then onboard mailboxes. 
- **Cross-tenant domain sharing**: Soon, you can join a private preview for capabilities that allow you to share a domain across multiple tenants. For example, if Contoso acquires Wingtip Toys, Contoso can share the domain with Wingtip Toys so that people in both tenants can use "contoso.com" as their email addresses.

![Service health page for multi-tenant with an incident selected and the Tenants affected tab open. The navigation menu has All tenants, Setup, and Service health as the only options.](../media/MAC-WN-MTinServiceHealth.png)

### Monitor your most important accounts

You can monitor and track failed or delayed email messages sent to your users who have a high business impact, like your CEO. You track priority accounts by adding users to your priority accounts list in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Add executives, leaders, managers, or other users who have access to sensitive or high priority information.

Priority accounts are only available to organizations that meet both of the following requirements:

- Office 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E3, or Office 365 E5 or Microsoft 365 E5.
- At least 10,000 licenses and at least 50 monthly active Exchange Online users.

![Setup page for the feature: Monitor your most important accounts.](../media/MAC-WN-PriorityAccounts.png)

There are two ways to get started:

- Go to **Users**, and then in the three dots (more actions) menu select **Manage priority accounts** to add users to the list.
- Go to **Setup**, find the setup task **Monitor your most important accounts**, and then select **Get started**.

For more info on priority accounts, check out [Monitoring priority accounts](./setup/priority-accounts.md).

### Search faster and get better results from any page

We've started rolling out a new Search experience for the admin center, and we can't wait for you to try it out.
![Search box has moved to the banner region. Alt+S to search from any page.](../media/MAC-WN-GlobalSearch.png)

- The Search box moved to the header area where it says "Microsoft 365 admin center" so you now search from any page, not just the Home page. We've even got a shortcut: **Alt+S**.
- Search is smarter and will give you better results, even faster. Try typing "2fa" to get started.
- Search results are organized by the type of item or action you can take.
  - **Users**: Select the user's name and you can edit that user right there. If you select the three dots (more actions) menu next to their name, you can reset their password. You can search by display name, last name, first name, username or primary email address, and email aliases. But to get an exact match, search by primary email address or username.
  - **Groups**: Edit the group from any page, add members, assign owners.
  - **Actions**: Similar to how you can search for a user and then reset their password, you can also search "reset password" from any page and then reset one or more passwords for users.
  - **Navigation**: Results under Navigation can quickly help you get to a page in the admin center quickly. For example, searching "roles" will take you to the Roles page for Azure AD roles.
  - **Settings**: Search for any setting related to your organization, the services you subscribe to, and security and privacy settings. 
  - **Domains**: You can find quick links to your domains, and then the link will take you to that domain's Overview and health page.
  - **Documentation**: If we can't find a result for you, we'll try to find some documentation to help. It takes a little longer for the curated list of articles to find a match, so wait a second to let Search find the results. 
  - **Feedback**: Didn't find what you were looking for? Send us feedback from Search. We will add searching functionality for more pages and more features across the admin center.

### Microsoft 365 admin mobile app

The [Microsoft 365 admin mobile app](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/manage-office-365-admin-app), which is included with your subscription, lets you manage Microsoft 365 from your mobile device so you can get away from your desk to do every day tasks. In fact, there are over 90 features in the app--and we just added a few more:

- **Support for Microsoft Intune's Mobile Application Management and Conditional Access policies**: You can now use your personal device to manage Microsoft 365 even if your org has turned on Intune's Mobile Application Management and conditional access policies.
- **Message center notifications**: Turn on message center notifications at **Settings** > **Notifications** if you wish to be alerted about new message center posts. Through notifications, we want to ensure you stay informed about important information and events across your tenant.
- **Billing alerts**: You can also turn on billing notifications at **Settings** > **Notifications** if you want to get billing notifications on your device if a subscription is about to expire.
- **Dark mode**: Welcome to the dark side of the mobile app. This was one of our most requested features. Go to **Settings** > **Themes** to turn it on.
- **Report an issue**: You can now report an issue in the app or view issues reported by other admins. Visit **Service health** to check it out.

![The Health page in Microsoft 365 admin app with notifications for message center, service health, billing alerts.](../media/MAC-WN-AdminMobileApp.png)

### Usage recommendations for small and medium businesses

Small and medium businesses might get a recommendation on the **Home** page if some of the people in the org aren't actively using Teams, OneDrive, or Office apps. When you view the recommendation, you can quickly email Microsoft training to inactive users to help them get started with the app and to make sure you are getting the full value from your subscriptions.

### Remote work collection

In October, we'll be adding a remote work collection to help small business owners and their staff get online and working remotely.  **Remote work essentials** setup is a curated list of all features Microsoft recommends to securely enable remote work and to collaborate effectively. In a couple of weeks, you can try it out in **Setup** > **Remote work essentials**.

![Remote work essentials page in Setup with 7 tasks not started.](../media/MAC-WN-RemoteWork.png)

For more information about how to securely allow remote work and a handy web address that's easy to remember and share, go to [aka.ms/remote-business](https://aka.ms/remote-business).

### Need help? moving to more admin centers

We're continuously looking at and updating the content and tools to keep up with changes in the product. We now have many more self-serve diagnostic tools to help you resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Here are a few that were recently added:

- Change your Exchange Web Service throttling policy
- Checking status of Teams provisioning and validation to specific users
- Fix DKIM setup issues
- Diagnose Intune user enrollment errors

And we are rolling out the new and improved support experience you already see in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2166757" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> to some of the other admin centers. Teams admin center and Security and Compliance admin centers already have this new experience. And soon, **Exchange admin center**, **SharePoint admin center**, and **Office.com** will be updated along with this new help experience for admins.

### Manage changes with Microsoft Planner

In May, we announced that you'll soon be able to sync Message center posts to Microsoft Planner and now it's available for everyone to use.  You can now create tasks from messages, assign them, and track them to completion. The first time, you select **Planner syncing** you'll need to connect to the appropriate plan.

![Message center page with 'planner syncing' highlighted in the command bar next to the preferences button.](../media/MAC-WN-MCPlannerSync.png)

To learn more about it, check out this article and video to see how it works: [Track your message center posts in Planner](/Office365/Planner/track-message-center-tasks-planner)

### Documentation, Training, and Videos

- Brand new and just in time for Microsoft Ignite--[The Virtual Hub](https://adoption.microsoft.com/virtual-hub/). Deep dive into technical training for IT pros and developers. Quickly find around 20 new videos as part of #SIDETRACKED, the name of the Ignite admin track this year.
- [What's new with Microsoft 365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVjb2lGJ4GU&t=2s) video series: This month, we cover new features available in Whiteboard for Teams and on the web, how to automate user provisioning to Azure AD, new Power Automate triggers and actions in Teams, and more. And stay tuned for next month, where we'll have a recap of all the great things happening at Ignite!
- We did a redesign of the [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365) page that focuses on solutions first. We'll highlight new solutions as they become available on this page, so keep an eye out.

![New landing page for Microsoft 365 solutions documentation with solutions like "Empower remote workers".](../media/MAC-WN-M365Docspage.png)

## July 2020

### Getting ready for Ignite 2020

As we're moving into Ignite season at Microsoft, we're not releasing as many features so that we have a lot to talk about during our sessions.

The next update to this article will be on opening day of our first online-only Ignite. And this year, it is free to attend! Check it out, get signed up: [Microsoft Ignite 2020](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite).

### Your products

There has been a lot of work done in the subscriptions management to make the page faster to load, faster to find what you're looking for, and to meet the web accessibility standards ([WCAG 2.1 guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)).

- **Table redesign**: The table was redesigned so that you can group similar subscriptions. Go to **Billing** > **Your products**.
- **Product details**: Get more details than ever about your subscriptions by selecting the product in the list.
- **Do it all from here**: And you don't have to go to jump around several pages to manage one product. For example, if you need to cancel a subscription, the panel will open to do the action right there.

![Your Products page with the Cancel Subscription panel open.](../media/MAC-WN-SubscrDetails.png)

### Domains

Domain management can be complicated, and we've released a new feature to make that easier. Go to Settings > Domains and then select a domain to get more information about your domain and the domain's health.

:::image type="content" source="../media/MAC-WN-DomainDNS.PNG" alt-text="Domains details page for contoso.com.":::

### Docs, training, and videos (July 2020)

[What's new with Microsoft 365](https://youtu.be/m1Nu8WJgCDY) video series: This month, we cover the new Yammer experience for web and mobile, how to integrate the Yammer Communities app for Microsoft Teams, new policy packages to support Firstline Workers and managers, and more.

## June 2020

### Keeping up with Office What's New management

A few months ago, we added a setting that lets you manage the What's New messages that show up in a user's Office apps. This month, we released a new Home page card that will help you act quickly and keep track of the **What's New** messages that you want shown to the users in your organization.

### Docs, training, and videos (June)

- [Getting started with Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/6723dc43-dbc0-46e6-af49-8a2d1c5cb937)

## May 2020

### New update channel for Office

On May 12, we announced the availability of a new update channel for Office:  Monthly Enterprise Channel. This update channel provides your users with new Office features once a month, on the second Tuesday of the month.

If you allow your users to self-install Office from the portal, you can select Monthly Enterprise Channel for them. To do this, sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and go to **Show all** >**Settings** > **Org settings** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743" target="_blank">**Services**</a> > **Office software download settings**. If you select **Once a month (Monthly Enterprise Channel)**, then any new self-installs of Office are configured to use Monthly Enterprise Channel.

In conjunction with the release of Monthly Enterprise Channel, we’re also revising the names of the existing update channels. For example, Monthly Channel is being renamed to Current Channel. The new names take effect on June 9, 2020.

For more information, see [Changes to update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps](/DeployOffice/update-channels-changes).

### New admin roles

We've added some new Azure Active Directory admin roles to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

- Hybrid identity admin role gives users permission to manage cloud provisioning and authentication services.
- Network admin role lets users manage network locations and review network insights for Microsoft 365 Software as a Service app.
- Printer admin role grants permission to manage all aspects of printers and printer connections.
- Printer technician is a subset of the Printer admin role where those users can register and unregister printers, and update printer status.
To find out more about these roles, see [About admin roles](./add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

### Export groups list

We've heard from a lot of admins that they need to share information about groups and their usage to people who don't have access to the admin centers. You can now export the Groups list to a CSV file for auditing purposes, which means you can throw out that old PowerShell script. To try it out, go to **Groups** > **Groups**, and then select **Export groups** from the command bar.

### Microsoft 365 solution and architecture center

Just this month, we released a new site on docs.microsoft.com called the [Microsoft 365 solution and architecture center](../solutions/index.yml), which brings together the technical guidance you need to understand, plan, and implement integrated Microsoft 365 solutions for secure and compliant collaboration. In this center, you'll find:

- Foundational solution guidance
- Workload solutions and scenario guidance
- Solution and architecture illustrations (The posters!!!)
- Industry specific guidance
- Enterprise architecture design principals

### Docs, training, and videos (May)

- **What's new in Microsoft 365 video series**: This month, we cover the new support experience in the Teams admin and Security and Compliance Centers, Planner integration with the Message Center, and the new 3x3 video layout in Microsoft Teams. 
- The [Microsoft 365 admin center help](./index.yml) hub page was updated to help you find what you need more quickly. And if you go look at that page right now, we've added a card to inform you of important updates and changes.
