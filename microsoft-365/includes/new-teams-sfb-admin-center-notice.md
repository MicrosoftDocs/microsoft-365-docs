The Microsoft Teams admin center is gradually replacing the Skype for Business admin center, and we're migrating Teams settings to it from the Microsoft 365 admin center. If a setting has been migrated, you'll see a notification and then be directed to the setting's location in the Teams admin center. For more information, see [Manage Teams during the transition to the Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/manage-teams-skypeforbusiness-admin-center).
