# Restore data in Microsoft 365 Backup (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview and subject to change.

Once you back up your data, you might need to restore the data if there was an accidental deletion, ransomware attack, or other event. The Restore feature in Microsoft 365 Backup is created to help you restore backed up data.

As part of restoring data from backup, admin needs to choose a *restore point* manually or from a recommended *express restore point* by the tool.

- **Restore point**. A prior point in time from which you can restore a healthy version of your content or metadata. If the data from a prior point in time is identical to the present state of your data, then there will be no items restored, including **Restore to a new folder** for Exchange Online.

- **Express restore point**. A set of recommended restore points that offers faster restore of data from the backup than a regular restore point.

    **We recommend you choose express restore point for faster restore performance.**

Currently, you can restore OneDrive accounts, SharePoint sites, and Exchange mailbox content from specific prior points in time from the backups. Site restores to a prior point in time, if restored to the same URL, will overwrite the state and the content of the site to match the exact state at the prior point in time. This is commonly referred to as a rollback versus a roll-forward.

Mailbox restores inherently restore only changed items such that current items that remain unchanged since the desired prior restore point won't be modified or overwritten. Thus, mailbox restores follow a roll-forward process. Site, OneDrive, and mailbox restores can be done in place or in the case of SharePoint sites to a new URL, or in the case of mailbox items a new folder. By restoring to a new location, any undesirable overwriting any existing data is avoided.

> [!NOTE]
> During the preview, only full OneDrive account and SharePoint site restore is possible. In the future, file-level granular restore will be possible.

In the future, we'll support granular OneDrive and SharePoint file-level restore to provide a roll-forward behavior similar to that of mailbox item restores today.

Restores started serially for each of three services will execute in parallel. There's no need to wait for one service’s restore to finish before starting another.

## Restore point frequency

The restore point frequency, also known as the [recovery point objective](backup-faq.md#what-is-the-service-recovery-point-objective) (RPO), defines the maximum amount of time during which data is lost after an attack. Stated differently, it’s the time between the most recent backup of the healthy state of data and the time of the attack. The RPOs for each of the protected services are summarized in the following table.

|Type  |RPO for 0-14 days in the past  |RPO for 15-365 days in the past  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Full OneDrive account and full SharePoint site restore    |15 minutes     |One week     |
|Exchange Online   |10 minutes         |10 minutes         |

## Restore data from backup for OneDrive, SharePoint, and Exchange

Once you back up your data, you might need to restore the data if there was an accidental deletion, ransomware attack, or other event. The restore feature in Microsoft 365 Backup is created to help you restore backed up data.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend choosing an express restore point for full account, site, or mailbox restores as it will provide the fastest restore experience.

Select the **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, or **Exchange** tab for steps to restore data from backup for that product.

# [OneDrive](#tab/onedrive)

Follow these steps to restore data backed up for OneDrive.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **OneDrive** section, select **Restore**.

2. On the **Select type of content** page, you'll see **OneDrive accounts** preselected. Select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Select type of content page with OneDrive accounts selected.](../media/m365-backup/backup-onedrive-select-type.png)

3. From the list of backed up OneDrive accounts, select the accounts to restore, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Select the date and time** page, select the date and time from which you want to restore the content.

    ![Screenshot showing the Select the date and time page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-onedrive-select-date-time.png)

    Choose a recommended restore point from **Select a faster restore point**, which will offer a faster restore compared to standard restore points.

    ![Screenshot showing the Select a faster restore point option for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-onedrive-select-faster-restore.png)

    Backup will restore the closest backed up content *before* the specified date and time. Select **Next**.

    For example, assume backup is taken October 2, 2023 8:00 AM and October 2, 10:00 AM PST. If you select date and time as October 2, 2023 9:00 AM PST, Microsoft 365 Backup will restore the OneDrive and its content to its state on October 2, 2023 8:00 AM PST.

5. On the **Confirm restore points** page, you're presented with a list of available express restore points that will restore with better performance than non-express restore points. We highly recommend that you choose an express restore point all else equal.

    ![Screenshot showing the Confirm restore points page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-onedrive-confirm-restore.png)

6. Confirm the restore point in time to which the data will be restored from backup. If the restore point is correct, select **Next**.

7. On the **Select another backup** panel, choose another backup for the account selected, if needed.

    ![Screenshot showing the Review and finish page for SharePoint.](../media/m365-backup/backup-sharepoint-review-finish.png)
  

# [Exchange](#tab/exchange)

<!---Once you have set up protection policies for your mailboxes, you might need to restore the data in case of an accidental deletion, ransomware attack, or other event. The Restore feature in Microsoft 365 Backup is created to help you restore backed up data. Exchange restores will only restore modified or deleted items. Any item that is unaffected in the visible folder structure will remain intact.--->

Follow these steps to restore data backed up for Exchange.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **Exchange** section, select **Restore**.

2. On the **Select type of content** page, you'll see **Exchange mailbox content (emails, notes, contacts, calendars, and tasks)** preselected. Select **Next**. Note that calendar restores aren't supported during the preview.

3. From the list of backed up Exchange accounts, select the accounts to restore, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Content scope** page, you'll see two options to choose from:

    - [Option 1: All emails, notes, contacts, calendars, and tasks](#option-1-all-emails-notes-contacts-calendars-and-tasks)
    - [Option 2: Selected content only](#option-2-selected-content-only)

### Option 1: All emails, notes, contacts, calendars, and tasks

1. Use this option to perform a full mailbox restore, On the **Content scope** page, the **All emails, notes, contacts, calendars, and tasks** option lets you restore all emails, notes, contacts, and tasks, and modified calendar items for that user account. Select the last known good (LKG) date and time from which you want to restore the content. Make sure that the time zone in the dropdown menu reflects your intention, and select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Content scope page with the All emails, notes, contacts, calendars, and tasks option selected.](../media/m365-backup/backup-exchange-content-scope-all.png)

    For example, the last time the end user remembers seeing their mailbox in a "good state" was October 2, 2023 8:00 AM. However, on October 2, 2023 9:00 AM they saw all of their emails were encrypted (possible ransomware attack), choose the last known good time as October 2, 2023 8:00 AM.

2. Now you're asked to confirm the restore point in time to which the data will be restored from backup. The page informs you whether there are any backups to restore from the LKG time chosen. If you see no errors, you can proceed. If there are errors, you have the option to choose another LKG time. Select **Next**.

3. The destination of restored items can be chosen from two options, then select **Next**.

    a. **Restore to a new folder** where the content will be restored to a newly created folder named *Restored Items YYYY-DD-MM, HH:MM*.

    b. **Restore in place** where current version of the item will be overwritten by the restored content.

4. On the **Review and Finish** page, you'll now be asked to review and finish all your choices. If everything looks as you want it, select **Restore user mailboxes**.

5. Track the progress of your newly created task on the **Restoration tasks** tab.

### Option 2: Selected content only

1. Use this option to perform a partial mailbox restore. On the **Content scope** page, the **Selected content only** option gives the admin the ability to do a granular restore (not full mailbox restore).

    ![Screenshot showing the Content scope page with the Selected content only option selected.](../media/m365-backup/backup-exchange-content-scope-selected.png)

    The search for items is based on four options:

    - Sender
    - Recipient
    - Has attachment
    - Keywords

    Choose the time period, then filter and value that you want to do a granular search on to find matching items.
  
2. Now you're asked to confirm the restore point in time to which the data will be restored from backup. If the restore point is what you want, select **Next**.

3. The destination of restored items can be chosen from two options, then select **Next**.

    a. **Restore to a new folder** where the content will be restored to a newly created folder named *Recovered Items YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM*.

    Example:

    ![Screenshot showing an example of newly create folder where content has been restored.](../media/m365-backup/backup-restore-to-new-folder.png)

    b. **Restore in place** where the current version of the item will be overwritten by the restored content.

4. On the **Review and Finish** page, you'll now be asked to review and finish all your choices. If everything looks as you want it, select **Restore user mailboxes**.

5. Track the progress of your newly created task on the **Restoration tasks** tab.
