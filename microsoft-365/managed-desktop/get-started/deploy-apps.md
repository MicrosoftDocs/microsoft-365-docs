# Deploy apps to devices
Part of onboarding to Microsoft Managed Desktop includes adding and deploying apps to your user's devices. Once you're using the Microsoft Managed Desktop portal, you can add and deploy your apps. 

The overall process looks like this:
1. [Add apps to Microsoft Managed Desktop portal](#1) - This can be existing line-of-business (LOB) apps, or apps from Microsoft Store for Business that you've synced with Intune. 
2. [Create Azure Active Directory (AD) groups for app assignment](#2) - You'll use these groups to manage app assignment.
3. [Assign apps to your users](#3)

## Step 1: Add apps to Microsoft Managed Desktop portal
You can add [Win32, or Windows MSI-based apps](#lob-apps), or [Microsoft Store for Business apps](#msfb-apps) to Microsoft Managed Desktop, and then deploy them to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

For information on requirements for apps installed on Microsoft Managed Desktop devices, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop app requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/mmd-app-requirements).

In this procedure, you'll select which kind of app you want to add, and then configure and upload the app source.

## Step 2: Create Azure AD groups

Create three Azure AD groups for each app. This table outlines the groups you'll need (Available, Required, and Uninstall). 

App assignment type |    Group use    | Example Azure AD name
--- | --- | ---
Available |  The app will be available from Company Portal app or website. | MMD – *app name* – Available
Required |  The app is installed on devices in the selected groups. | MMD – *app name* – Required
Uninstall |  The app is uninstalled from devices in the selected groups. | MMD – *app name* – Uninstall

Add your users to these groups to either make the app available, install the app, or remove the app from their Microsoft Managed Desktop device.
