# Order Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership.

Microsoft Managed Desktop no longer requires device models be from the list of [currently approved devices](../service-description/device-list.md). As of May 3, 2021, all devices from an approved manufacturer should meet our posted hardware and software requirements. You can continue to use devices on that list with confidence, but you can find more devices recommended for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/business/devices) site. At that site, view the recommended devices by expanding **Features** in the **Filter by** area, and then selecting **Microsoft Managed Desktop**. Anytime you plan to enroll a particular device model in the service for the first time, you should test an example to ensure it'll deliver the user experience you expect. For more information, see [Validate new devices](../get-started/validate-device.md).
