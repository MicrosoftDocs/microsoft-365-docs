Microsoft and Microsoft Managed Desktop customers have equally critical, yet different responsibilities around applications used with Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## Microsoft responsibilities
**Office 365 apps**
Microsoft will provide full service for the deployment, update, and support of specific Office 365 apps. All users will receive the base set of Office 365 click to run, 64 bit version of applications included in the device’s image so that a user can quickly become productive. The Project and Visio applications in of the Office 365 suite are licensed separately.  Microsoft Managed Desktop will provide deployment groups allowing the IT Administrator to manage licenses and deploy these applications appropriately for their organization. Microsoft will support end users of these applications through the Microsoft Managed Desktop Support channels.

**Line-of-business apps**
Microsoft provides tooling for IT Administrators to manage and deploy their Line of Business applications to end users as a part of the Intune product. Microsoft will support application deployment issues as detailed in [Line-of-business applications](#line-of-business-applications) 

**Deploy with Intune**
Intune will be linked to the **Microsoft Store for Business** during Microsoft Managed Desktop onboarding allowing procured apps to be deployed through Intune. Microsoft will also deploy the web-based version of the Company Portal to end users so that IT Administrators can provide a self-service experience for end users.

**App management**
Microsoft may identify restricted applications which are not suitable for the modern workplace because of their system impact. When such an application is identified Microsoft will notify the customer and that application will need to be removed from the tenant. 

## Customer responsibilities
The Office 365 Suite is core to Microsoft’s productivity offerings and is included in the Microsoft 365 License for all Microsoft Managed Desktop users. While Microsoft deploys, updates, and supports Office Applications to Microsoft Managed Desktop Devices there are still some areas for which the customer is responsible.
- **Assign licenses** - Customers are responsible for  assigning of the appropriate licenses to end users for Office 365. 
- **Add users to security groups** - For customers with users that need Project or Visio the IT administrator must add that user to the appropriate deployment groups. IT administrators are also responsible for managing end of life for that user. 
- **Deploy Office 365 Add Ons** - Customers are responsible for deploying of any plugins to the Office 365 suite which are deemed necessary. 

Since line-of-business (LOB) apps are unique for each customer, customers are responsible for managing all applications within their organization not deployed by Microsoft. This includes:
- Deciding which apps are needed and who needs them
- Assigning apps to those users
- Create and maintain Azure Active Directory (AD) groups for managing app assignments 

Once the core set of LOB apps has been identified the customer will procure, license, package, and test those applications in the Microsoft Managed Desktop environment. The customer must upload and deploy applications to Intune to deploy, update, and decommission their LOB applications. Customers are responsible for managing LOB apps support for their users.
 

## Office applications
As part of the Microsoft 365 E5 license, Office 365 Standard Suite (64 Bit) is deployed by Microsoft. 

For details, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop technologies](../intro/technologies-and-devices.md) <!--- and the other applications licensed under Office 365 E5 may be deployed by the customer using Intune’s deployment tools.-->

## Line-of-business applications

## Resources
While many services are out of scope for Microsoft Managed Desktop operations there are services which Microsoft offers which may help the customer manage their applications.

### Windows Upgrade Readiness
A key part of setting up new Microsoft Managed Devices is understanding which apps are needed to for device users. Windows Upgrade Readiness is a Microsoft tool which helps enterprises understand the application landscape inside their company, and helps them to review key data about those applications:
- **Application usage** - Telemetry data is used to monitor application usage
- **Application compatibility** - Upgrade Readiness looks at each application and sees how broadly it has been deployed on the latest version of Windows 10 and assesses how to identify if it is “Ready for Windows”. This data helps focus testing efforts so on applications which aren’t already broadly adopted.

### Intune application deployment
Application management can be handled through the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal, or through the Intune portal. Intune’s app management portal shows applications deployed for Windows, Android, and iOS. Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal limits the view to Windows 10 applications. Both are available through the Azure Portal.

- [Add a Windows 32 application](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/lob-apps-windows)
- [Add web applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/web-app)
- [Assign and deploy apps to groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps-deploy)

### Application packaging standards
To deploy Windows 32 applications through Intune they must be packaged as either a single .MSI, an .appx, or .MSIX. The most common package type for Intune is currently .MSI.
