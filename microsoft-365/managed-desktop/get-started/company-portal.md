# Install Intune Company Portal on devices

Microsoft Managed Desktop requires that IT administrators install Intune Company Portal for their users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Here are some benefits for your organization:
- Users have one place to browse and install available applications. 
- IT administrators can organize applications by categories for their users.  
- Some applications (like Microsoft Project and Microsoft Visio) require Company Portal to deploy with Microsoft Managed Desktop.
- IT administrators can customize Company Portal for their organization. This includes brand imaging, adding in local support contacts, and more. For more information, see [How to Configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](/intune/company-portal-app).   

This topic documents the process for deploying the Intune Company Portal to your Microsoft Managed Desktop users. The overall process looks like this:
1. Purchase Company Portal from Microsoft Store for Business and sync with Intune
2. Assign Company Portal to your users
3. Communicate change to your users

## Step 1 - Purchase Company Portal from Microsoft Store for Business and sync with Intune
For info on how to purchase the apps and sync with Intune, see [Microsoft Store for Business apps](deploy-apps.md#msfb-apps) in *Deploy apps to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices*.

This topic provides info on how to: 
- Purchase Company Portal from Microsoft Store for Business

## Step 2 - Assign Company Portal to your users
