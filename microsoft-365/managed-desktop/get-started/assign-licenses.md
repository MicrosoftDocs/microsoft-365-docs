# Assign licenses

As part of preparing to enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop, you'll need to be sure you've obtained the necessary licenses. If you haven't already obtained the licenses, see [More about licenses](../get-ready/prerequisites.md#more-about-licenses) for details about exactly which licenses you need.


If your licenses are all lined up, it's time now to assign them to your users. To assign licenses, we recommend that you take advantage of the [group-based licensing feature](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-licensing-whatis-azure-portal) of Azure Active Directory.

If you have any difficulty with license assignment, contact Admin [support](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md).
