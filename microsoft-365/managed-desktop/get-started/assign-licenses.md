# Assign licenses

In preparation to enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop, you must ensure you've obtained the necessary licenses. For more information about licenses, see [More about licenses](../get-ready/prerequisites.md#more-about-licenses) for the licenses you'll need.

When you have the appropriate licenses, assign them to your users. To assign licenses, we recommend that you take advantage of the [group-based licensing feature](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-licensing-whatis-azure-portal) of Azure Active Directory.
