# Enable user support features

Whether you are providing your own user support or working with a partner to provide it, follow these steps to enable the support provider to request elevated device access or escalate issues to Microsoft Managed Desktop, if needed.

1. If they don't already have one, users need an account in same Azure Active Directory (AAD) domain as the Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.
2. Add the user accounts from Step 1 to the **Modern Workplace Roles-Support Partner** security group in AAD.
