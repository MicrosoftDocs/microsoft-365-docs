# Prepare devices

You can use both new and existing devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## Obtain new devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership.

**To obtain new devices:**

1. Review the list of currently recommended devices by filtering for Microsoft Managed Desktop in the [Shop Windows Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/business/devices) site.
1. Order one or a few examples of the devices you want to use with a compliant image. Ordering might require [specific ordering steps](../service-description/device-images.md).
1. [Validate](validate-device.md) the example devices.
1. After successful validation, order the devices, working with an approved device partner.
1. Once they've arrived, either:
    - [Manually register](manual-registration.md).
    - Work with a partner to register the devices.
1. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

## Reuse existing devices

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Check that your existing devices meet our [device requirements](../service-description/device-requirements.md). You can also use the downloadable [readiness assessment checker](../get-ready/readiness-assessment-downloadable.md) to verify that a given device meets the necessary requirements. <br><br>If you reuse an existing device, you may have to reimage it. For image options, see [Device images](../service-description/device-images.md).

**To reuse existing devices:**

1. Select one or a few examples of the devices you want to reuse, and then [validate them](validate-device.md).
1. After successful validation, either:
    - [Manually register existing devices](manual-registration-existing-devices.md).
    - Work with a partner to register the devices.
1. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.
