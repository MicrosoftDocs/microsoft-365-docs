# Enable Enterprise State Roaming

[Enterprise State Roaming](/azure/active-directory/devices/enterprise-state-roaming-overview) lets users securely synchronize user and application settings data to the cloud. This means they'll have the same experience no matter which Windows device they sign into. For example, if you replace one of their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices with a new one, it will look and behave exactly the same as the last one. Enterprise State Roaming is an optional feature for the Microsoft Managed Desktop service that you can configure for your users, this setting isn't included or managed as part of Microsoft Managed Desktop.
