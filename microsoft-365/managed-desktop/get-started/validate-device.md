# Validate new devices

Whether you're completely new to Microsoft Managed Desktop or a long-time subscriber, it's best to test an example of any device model you're enrolling in the service for the first time. This is true whether you're ordering brand-new devices or reusing existing ones, including devices recommended for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows 10 Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/view-all-devices) site. At that site, view the devices recommended for use with the service by expanding **Features** in the **Filter by** area, and then selecting **Microsoft Managed Desktop**. Validating devices ensures that they'll deliver the user experience you expect.

## Validate devices

1. Take one or more examples of new models through the steps in the following articles:
    - [Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices](set-up-devices.md)
    - [Localize the user experience](localization.md)
    - [First-run experience with Autopilot and the Enrollment Status Page](esp-first-run.md)
    - [Windows 10 location service](device-location.md)
    - [Get started with app control](get-started-app-control.md)
    - [Deploy apps to devices](deploy-apps.md)
2. Verify that the following experiences work without any failures, errors, or prompts:
    - The Autopilot experience after joining the network and the user signs in
    - If you've enabled the [Enrollment Status Page](esp-first-run.md), it works.
    - User can sign into to Office applications
    - OneDrive folders sync, including Windows Desktop, Documents, and Pictures
    - Device receives updates, policies, and line-of-business applications
3. Review the reported devices and hardware requirements in the [Device inventory report](../working-with-managed-desktop/device-inventory-report.md) to check that they match what you expect.

If any problems occur, you can [request support](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md) in the Admin portal.

If everything goes well, you're ready to order the rest of the validated devices you need for your deployment.
