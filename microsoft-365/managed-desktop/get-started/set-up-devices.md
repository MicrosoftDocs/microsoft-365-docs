# Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

You can use both new and existing devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## To obtain new devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership. In essence, however, the process is like this:

1. Review the list of currently recommended devices by filtering for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows 10 Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/view-all-devices) site.
2. Order one or a few examples of the devices you want to use with a compliant image. Ordering might require [specific ordering steps](../service-description/device-images.md).
3. [Validate](validate-device.md) the example devices.
5. After successful validation, order the devices, working with an approved device partner.
6. Once they've arrived, do either of the following:
    - [Register new devices yourself](register-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
7. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

## To reuse existing devices

1. Check that your existing devices meet our [device requirements](../service-description/device-requirements.md). You can also use the downloadable [readiness assessment checker](../get-ready/readiness-assessment-downloadable.md) to verify that a given device meets the necessary requirements. 
2. If you reuse an existing device, you may have to reimage it. For image options, see [Device images](../service-description/device-images.md).
3. Select one or a few examples of the devices you want to reuse, and then [validate them](validate-device.md).
4. After successful validation, do either of the following:
    - [Register existing devices yourself](register-reused-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
5. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
