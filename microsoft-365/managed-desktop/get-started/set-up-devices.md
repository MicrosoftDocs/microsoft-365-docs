# Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

You can use both new and existing devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## To obtain new devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership. In essence, however, the process is like this:

1. Select a device meeting our [device requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/device-requirements?view=o365-worldwide)
2. Order the devices, working with an approved device partner. Ensure any necessary [OEM device ordering steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/device-images?view=o365-worldwide#new-devices) are followed.
3. Once they've arrived, do either of the following:
    - [Register new devices yourself](register-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
4. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

## To reuse existing devices

1. Check that your existing device(s) meet our [device requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/device-requirements?view=o365-worldwide). Besides reviewing device specs, you can also use the downloadable [readiness assessment checker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/get-ready/readiness-assessment-downloadable?view=o365-worldwide) to verify that a given device meets the necessary requirements. 
3. If you reuse an existing device, you may have to reimage it. Check out your [image options here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/device-images?view=o365-worldwide#existing-devices).
4. We recommend you follow our recommended device process for bringing on existing hardware to ensure your users have a great experience.
5. Do either of the following:
    - [Register existing devices yourself](register-reused-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
6. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
