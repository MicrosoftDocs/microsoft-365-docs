# Usage insights
This view provides usage metrics for your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. For these purposes, an app is considered "in use" if it is running and in focus.

To view usage data, select the **Usage** tab.

## Device usage

In the **Device usage** area, we display the usage level of reporting devices over time, as well as how many registered devices are reporting data. For all data displayed on this page, you can change the interval to view reported data in either the last 14 or 28 days by using the drop-down menu in the upper right.

We categorize the usage level with these terms:

- **Active:** at least 55 hours of usage
- **Low:** between 8 and 55 hours of usage
- **Inactive:** less than 8 hours of usage




## Application usage

The **Application usage** area details the applications in order of usage and their respective hours of usage for your managed devices. It also shows the total number of managed devices using a given application. Select **Search** to find a specific application if it isn't already listed.


## Device details
The detail area provides information on specific devices, including total device hours and number of active days over the time period. Use the filters to limit the view to those devices with a “Active”, “Inactive”, or “Low” usage pattern or those that are “Not Reporting”.
