# Battery insights
This view provides power, battery, and app usage metrics for your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. For these purposes, an app is considered "in use" if it is running and in focus.

To view usage data, select the **Battery** tab.

![Battery pane: predicted battery life per device model in upper left, top energy consumers (by app) in upper right, insights table across the bottom. Documentation link in upper right.](../../media/insights_battery.png)

## Predicted battery life

In the **Predicted battery life** area, we provide predictions for the expected battery life for your devices, organized by device model.

> [!NOTE]
> This data is derived from sampling energy usage, usage time, and battery capacity from a random <em>selection</em> of the devices in your Microsoft Managed Desktop deployment that are also reporting data.

The table provides the predicted battery life (in hours), average battery life for the same models in other Microsoft Managed Desktop deployments, and the number of devices reporting this data in your environment. Sort the data by selecting the column headings.



## Top energy consumers

In the **Top energy consumers** area youâ€™ll find the apps in your environment that consume the most energy in milliWatt-hours (mWh). The apps shown are per specific device, which you select in the **Predicted battery life** section to the left. For example, to see the per-app consumption for your Microsoft Surface Book 2 devices, select that row in the battery life area. If you don't select any model, the app consumption data shown is for all apps that we have data for collectively.

 For each app, colored segments show you the distribution of the app's energy use among these categories:

- CPU
- Display
- Network
- Other

"Other" could include energy consumption by a variety of sources, such as disk activity, mobile broadband usage, and energy lost to internal resistance. 

You can filter this view to show only foreground apps, background apps, or both by using the menu in the upper right. Foreground apps are those that have had user interaction in the last 28 days, such as selecting something with a mouse.

## Insights

The **Insights** area shows the top three energy consumers in the CPU and network categories. These items are consuming higher than average energy compared to all Microsoft Managed Desktop deployments. We don't show the display resource because it depends heavily on device usage time and screen brightness settings. 

Select the listings in the **Details** column for more information.

## Battery optimization

Windows 10 offers numerous [device settings](https://support.microsoft.com/help/20443/windows-10-battery-saving-tips) to improve power usage and increase the battery life of your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Some of these settings can decrease other Windows functionality, so you'll also have to consider other factors such as the role of the device in your organization. Windows support maintains a list of these [battery saving tips](https://support.microsoft.com/help/20443/windows-10-battery-saving-tips).

Users can adjust some settings on their own without the need for admin elevation or support. Other settings require support from your organization's IT administrator.
