# Device status report

This report aggregates the status of all your registered devices to show your use of the Microsoft Managed Desktop service. We categorize devices based on their activity over the last 28 days and on our ability to keep the device updated. To be updated by Windows Update as soon as possible, a device must be connected to the internet and not hibernating or paused for a minimum of six hours, two of which must be continuous. Although it's possible that a device that doesn't meet these requirements will be updated, devices that meet them have the highest likelihood of being updated.

We report device status using these labels: 

- **Ready for user**: Devices that have been successfully registered with our service and are ready to be given to a user 
- **Active**: Devices that are being used and have met the activity criteria (six hours, two continuous) for the most recent security update release and have checked in with Microsoft Intune at least once in the past five days. 
- **Synced**: Devices that are being used and have checked in with Intune within the last 28 days 
- **Out of sync**: Devices that are being used but have not checked in with Intune in the last 28 days 
- **Other**: The category aggregates several error states that can occur, typically during device registration. For more details, see [Troubleshooting device registration](../get-started/register-devices-self.md#troubleshooting-device-registration).
