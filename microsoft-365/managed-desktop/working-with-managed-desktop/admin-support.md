# Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop

You can submit support tickets or feedback requests to Microsoft using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal. Support requests are always prioritized over feedback submissions. Support requests are triaged and managed according to severity as outlined in the [severity definition table](#sev). Feedback is reviewed and a response provided where requested.

## Open a new support request

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) and navigate to the **Tenant administration** menu.
2. Look for the Microsoft Managed Desktop section, and then select **Service requests**.
3. On the **Service requests** blade, select **+ New support request**.
4. Select the **Request type** that matches the help you need. The following table outlines the options.
5. Select the **Severity** level. For more information, see [Support request severity definitions](#sev).
6. Provide as much information about the request as possible to help the team respond quickly. Depending on the type of request, you may be required to provide different details.
7. Review all the information you provided for accuracy.
8. When you're ready, select **Create**.

Support request type|When to use
---|---
Incident|You require the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team to investigate a user issue caused by, for example, a widespread impact of a change or service outage.
Request for information|You're planning a change in networking, proxy configuration, VPN systems, certificate expiration, or just need some information about the service. A response from the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team is advised when communicating a change within your organization.
Change request|You require the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team to make a change, such as moving devices between update groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you create a support request you will need to list a Primary contact, responsible for working with our Service Engineers to resolve the issue or answer any questions about a requested change. We also require that you have previously [set up an Admin contact](../get-started/add-admin-contacts.md) who will be copied on all case notifications for their relevant area of focus and be asked to take over a case if the primary contact for a case is unreachable.

## Manage an active support request

The primary contact for a case (and any [Admin contact](../get-started/add-admin-contacts.md) for that area of focus) will receive email notifications when a case is **Created**, **Assigned** to a Service Engineer to investigate, and **Resolved**. If at any point you have a question about the case, the best way to get in touch with our team is to reply directly to one of those emails. If we have questions about your request or need more details to take action, we will email the Primary contact listed on the support requests (copying all the relevant Admin contacts).

### View all your active cases

While email is the recommended approach to interact with our team, you may want to see the summary status of all your support requests. At any time, you can use the portal to see all support requests Active during the last six months.

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) and navigate to the **Tenant Administration** menu.
2. Look for the *Microsoft Managed Desktop* section, select **Service request**.
3. From this view, you can export the summary view or click on any case to see the details

### Edit case details

If you need to edit the details of a case, for example updating the primary case contact or changing the severity, you will need to follow these steps:

1. From the **Service requests** blade, in the **Tenant Administration** menu of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/), use the search bar or filters to find the case you're interested in editing.
2. Select the case to open up the request's details
3. Scroll to the bottom of the request details and select **Edit**.
4. Update the editable information, add attachments to the case, or add a note for the Service Engineering team, then select **Save**.

Once a case is resolved it can no longer be edited. If a request has been resolved for less than 24hrs you will see the option to **reactivate** instead of **Edit**, and once reactivated you can again edit the request.  

### Provide feedback

We appreciate your feedback and use it to improve the admin support experience.

When you are the primary contact on for a support request, you will receive an email from Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations asking about your experience after your issue has been resolved. Feedback is actively monitored and shared with engineering to improve the service and prioritize future features. Be sure to focus on your experience and not include personal information in the feedback form. For more information about privacy, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

## Support request severity definitions

The initial response time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Managed Desktop engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The initial response time varies with the business impact of the request, based on the severity of the request.

> [!NOTE]
> In this table, "admin support hours" means, that Microsoft Managed Desktop support for admins is available, for most countries, 24 hours a day **Monday through Friday**. Severity A can be worked 24 hours a day all seven days of the week.

- **Support languages** - All support is provided in English.
- **Severity level changes** - Microsoft might downgrade the severity level if you aren't able to provide adequate resources or responses to enable us to continue with problem resolution efforts.
- **Application compatibility** - For an application compatibility issue to be considered, there must be a reproducible error, of the same version of the application, between the previous and current version of Windows or Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. To resolve application compatibility issues, we requires a point of contact in your org to work with. The contact must work directly with our Fast Track team to investigate and resolve the issue.
- **Customer response time** If you aren't able to meet the expected response requirements, we'll downgrade the request by one severity level, to a minimum of Severity C. If you're unresponsive to requests for action, we'll mitigate and close the support request within 48 hours of the last request.
