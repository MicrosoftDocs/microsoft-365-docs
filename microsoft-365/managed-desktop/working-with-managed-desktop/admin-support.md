# Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop

You can submit support tickets or feedback requests to Microsoft using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal. Support requests are always prioritized over feedback submissions. Support requests are triaged and managed according to severity as outlined in the [severity definition table](#sev). Feedback is reviewed and a response provided where requested. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure that you [set up an Admin contact](../get-started/add-admin-contacts.md) for app packaging, devices, security, and other requests. You won't be able to submit a support request in any of these areas if you don't provide an admin contact.

**To submit a support request**
1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) and navigate to the **Tenant administration** menu.
2. Look for the Microsoft Managed Desktop section, and then select **Service request**.
3. On **Support requests**, select **+ New Support ticket**.
4. Select the **Support request type** that matches the help you need. The following table outlines the options. 
5. Select the **Severity level**. For more information, see [Support request severity definitions](#sev). 

Support request type | When to use
--- | ---
Incident | You require the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team to investigate, for example, a widespread impact of a change or service outage.
Request for information | You're planning a change in networking, proxy configuration, VPN systems, certificate expiration, or just need some information about the service. A response from the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team is advised when communicating a change within your organization.
Change request | You require the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team to make a change, such as moving devices between update groups.

## Support request severity definitions

The initial response time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Managed Desktop engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The initial response time varies with the business impact of the request, based on the severity of the request.

> [!NOTE]
> In this table, "admin support hours" means, that Microsoft Managed Desktop support for admins is available, for most countries, 24 hours a day **Monday through Friday**. Severity A can be worked 24 hours a day all seven days of the week.

Severity level	| Situation |	Initial response time	| Expected response from you

**Severity B – Moderate Impact** |	**Moderate business impact**<br><br>Your business has moderate loss or degradation of services, but work can reasonably continue in an impaired manner.<br><br>**Moderate application compatibility impact**<br><br>A specific business group is no longer productive, due to devices not responding or loss of critical functionality. |	Initial: < 4 hours<br>Update: 12 hours<br>24 hours a day during admin support hours (Monday through Friday). | When you select Severity B, you confirm that the issue has moderate impact to your business with loss and degradation of services, but workarounds enable reasonable, albeit temporary, business continuity. <br><br>The issue demands an urgent response. If you chose all day every day support when you submit the support request, you commit to a continuous engagement every day with the Microsoft team until resolution. Otherwise, Microsoft might at its discretion decrease the severity to level C.

- **Support languages** - All support is provided in English.
- **Severity level changes** - Microsoft might downgrade the severity level if you aren't able to provide adequate resources or responses to enable us to continue with problem resolution efforts. 
- **Application compatibility** - For an application compatibility issue to be considered, there must be a reproducible error, of the same version of the application, between the previous and current version of Windows or Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. To resolve application compatibility issues, we requires a point of contact in your org to work with. The contact must work directly with our Fast Track team to investigate and resolve the issue.
- **Customer response time** If you aren't able to meet the expected response requirements, we'll downgrade the request by one severity level, to a minimum of Severity C. If you're unresponsive to requests for action, we'll mitigate and close the support request within 48 hours of the last request.
