# Getting help for users

There are two ways that users in your organization can get help with their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices: **Get Help** app, or phone support. Both of these support options are available to users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
 
>[!NOTE]
>These support options are not available for devices in the Test group.

## Get Help app

The preferred method for providing support to your users is **Get Help**, an easy-to-use interface built into the user device.

Get Help is an application that’s installed on all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and is pinned to the task bar. 

- Users can request a callback to a provided phone number, or chat online with a service rep.
- Requests that fall outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support scope are redirected to the local IT helpdesk via phone call.

> [!NOTE]
> The display language for the Get Help app is English only, even if a user has selected a different language when setting up their device or in device settings. 

### Prerequisites
For your users to be able to get help through the app, make sure these prerequisites are met:

- The device must be registered with Microsoft Managed Desktop using one of the methods in [Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices](../get-started/set-up-devices.md), such as [Register new devices yourself](../get-started/register-devices-self.md).
- The display language for the device must be set to any of these English-language locales: en-us, en-gb, en-au, en-nz, or en-ca.
- The Get Help app should be up to date. To confirm its status, check for app updates in the Microsoft Store.
- Certain [endpoints](../get-ready/network.md#endpoints-allowed-that-are-necessary-for-microsoft-managed-desktop) must be accessible from the device.

> [!NOTE]
> The Get Help app can take up to one hour after a device is deployed to fully function.

If you've checked these prerequisites and the Get Help app still isn't working, you as an IT admin should file a [support request](admin-support.md).

## Phone support

Users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices also have access to toll-free phone numbers they can call. The numbers are meant to be used when Get Help isn’t available. For example, if they can’t sign in to the device, or the device is broken. Here are the phone numbers for phone support:

- United States: +1 855 425 0216
- Canada (excluding Quebec): +1 855 425 0216
- United Kingdom: +44 800 026 0698
- Belgium: +32 800 58533
- Luxembourg: +352 800 40119
