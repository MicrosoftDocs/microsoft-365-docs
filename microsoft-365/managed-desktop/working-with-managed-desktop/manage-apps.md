## Roll back an app to a previous version

If there's an error found when a new version of an app is deployed, you can roll back to a previous version. The process outlined here is for apps where type is listed as **Windows MSI line-of-business app** or **Windows app (Win 32) - preview**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal](https://aka.ms/mmdportal).
2. Under **Inventory**, select **Apps**.  
3. Select the app you need to roll back, and then select **Edit**.
4. Under **Manage**, select **Properties**. 
    - For **Windows MSI line-of-business app** apps, select **App information**, and then under **Ignore app version**, select **Yes**.
    - For **Windows app (Win 32) - preview** apps, select **App information**, select **Detection rules**, and then select **Add**. 
    If there is an MSI rule, verify that **MSI product version check** is set to **No**.
5. [Upload a previous version of the app source file](../get-started/deploy-apps.md) to Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal.
