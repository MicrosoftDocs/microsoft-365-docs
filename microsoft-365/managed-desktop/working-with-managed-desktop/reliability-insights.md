The **Reliability across devices** section offers a quick health summary of your deployment over the last 14 days by reporting the percentage of devices considered to be “healthy” and the mean time observed since the last reported failure. 

 
The **Reliability over time** graph on the right reports the number of devices with critical errors and the total number of observed critical errors over time.

The **Top issues** section details specific detected issues that affect at least 5% of your managed devices. Reported details include:

- The type of issue
    - Application crashes, in which an app stops functioning or unexpectedly stops
    - Application hangs, where an application stops responding to input
    - Critical errors, which occur when Windows has encountered an issue it can't recover from
- The number of devices affected by the same issue
- The percentage of managed devices that number represents
- The total count of occurences of the specific issue
