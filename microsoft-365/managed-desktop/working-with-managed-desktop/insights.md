# Work with insights

Microsoft Managed Desktop provides a number of dashboards that IT admins in your tenant can use to understand various aspects of the population of devices. You access these through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

With these dashboards you can find the answers to questions like these:

- How many devices are active and when were they last used?
- Which apps are most used and during which times?
- Which apps are causing trouble by crashing or hanging a lot?
- How is Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations mitigating or resolving such problems?
- Which apps are consuming the most energy?
- What's the predicted battery life my devices?
- What is the current status of security updates on devices?
- How long did it take for 95% of the devices to get current with the latest security update?

To access these views from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, select **View details** in the **Reports** area:
