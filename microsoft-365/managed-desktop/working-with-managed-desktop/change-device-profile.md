# Change the device profile

You can change the [Device profiles](../service-description/profiles.md) assigned to a device using the Admin Portal.

The selected device profile will be applied to all devices you select in the first step.

**To change the device profile:**

1. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager, select **Devices** in the left pane.
1. In the **Microsoft Managed Desktop** section, select **Devices**.  
1. Select the checkboxes for the devices you want to modify.
1. Select **Change device profile**. A fly-in opens.
1. Use the dropdown menu to select the new device profile.
1. Check that the **Reset device** slider is set the way you want.
1. Select **Change profile**.

To move separate devices to different profiles, you'll need to repeat this process for each device profile.
