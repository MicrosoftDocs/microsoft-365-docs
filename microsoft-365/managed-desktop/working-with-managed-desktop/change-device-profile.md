# Reassign profiles

You can change the [Device profiles](../service-description/profiles.md) assigned to a device by using the Admin Portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a device's profile will erase all data on the device and cause it to restart. Make sure you’ve selected the right devices before proceeding and back up any data you might want to preserve.

The device profile you select will be applied to all devices you select in the first step. To move separate devices to different profiles, you’ll need to repeat this process for each device profile. 

1. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager, select **Devices** in the left pane. In the **Microsoft Managed Desktop** section of the menu, select **Devices**.  
2. Select the check boxes for the devices you want to modify. 
3. Select **Change device profile**; a fly-in opens.
4. Use the drop-down menu to select the new device profile.
5. Select **Change profile**.
