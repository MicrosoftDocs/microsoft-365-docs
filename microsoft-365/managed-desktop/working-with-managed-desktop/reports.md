# Work with reports

Microsoft Managed Desktop provides reports that IT admins in your tenant can use to understand various aspects of the population of devices. You access the reports in the [Admin portal ](https://aka.ms/mmdportal)under **Reporting**.



## Device inventory report

The **Devices** view offers an **Export all** tab that [downloads a detailed inventory report](device-inventory-report.md).
