# Prerequisites for guest accounts

Microsoft Managed Desktop requires the following settings in your Azure AD organization for guest account access. You can adjust these settings at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **External Identities / External collaboration settings**:

-   For **Guest invite restrictions** set to **Member users and users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users including guests with member permissions**
-   For **Collaboration restrictions**, choose any of these options:
    -   If you select **Allow invitations to be sent to any domain (most inclusive)**, no other configuration required.
    -   If you select **Deny invitations to the specified domains**, make sure that Microsoft.com isnâ€™t listed in the target domains.
    -   If you select **Allow invitations only to the specified domains (most restrictive)**, make sure that Microsoft.com *is* listed in the target domains.

If you set restrictions that interact with these settings, make sure to exclude the Azure Active Directory **Modern Workplace Service Accounts**. For example, if you have a conditional access policy that prevents guest accounts from accessing the Intune portal, exclude the **Modern Workplace Service Accounts** group from this policy.
