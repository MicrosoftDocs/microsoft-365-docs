# Prerequisites for guest accounts

## External collaboration settings

Microsoft Managed Desktop recommends the following configuration in your Azure AD organization for guest account access. You can adjust these settings at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **External Identities / External collaboration settings**:

-   For **Guest user access**, set to **Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects**
-   For **Guest invite settings**, set to **Member users and users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users including guests with member permissions**

Microsoft Managed Desktop requires the following configuration in your Azure AD organization for guest account access. You can adjust this setting at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **External Identities / External collaboration settings**:

-   **Collaboration restrictions**, choose any of these options:
    -   If you select **Allow invitations to be sent to any domain (most inclusive)**, no other configuration required.
    -   If you select **Deny invitations to the specified domains**, make sure that Microsoft.com isnâ€™t listed in the target domains.
    -   If you select **Allow invitations only to the specified domains (most restrictive)**, make sure that Microsoft.com *is* listed in the target domains.

If you set restrictions that interact with these settings, make sure to exclude the Azure Active Directory **Modern Workplace Service Accounts**. For example, if you have a conditional access policy that prevents guest accounts from accessing the Intune portal, exclude the **Modern Workplace Service Accounts** group from this policy.

For more information, see [Enable B2B external collaboration and manage who can invite guests](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/delegate-invitations#to-configure-external-collaboration-settings).

## Unlicensed Intune admin

The **Allow access to unlicensed admins** setting must be enabled. Without this setting enabled, errors can occur when we try to access your Azure AD organization for service. You can safely enable this setting without worrying about security implications, since the scope of access is defined by the roles assigned to users, including our operations staff.

To enable this setting, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Navigate to **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **Administrator licensing**.
3. In **Allow access to unlicensed admins**, select **Yes**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot undo this setting after you select **Yes**.

For more information, see [Unlicensed admins in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/unlicensed-admins).
