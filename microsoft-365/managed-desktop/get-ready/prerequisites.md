Connectivity |	All Microsoft Managed Desktop devices require connectivity to numerous Microsoft service endpoints from the corporate network.<br><br>For the full list of required IPs and URLs, see [Network configuration](../get-ready/network.md). 
Azure Active Directory |	Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must either be the source of authority for all user accounts, or user accounts must be synchronized from on-premises Active Directory using the latest supported version of Azure AD Connect.<br><br>[Enterprise State Roaming](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/enterprise-state-roaming-overview) must be enabled for Microsoft Managed Desktop users.<br><br>For more information, see [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect).<br><br>For more information on supported Azure AD Connect versions, see [Azure AD Connect:Version release history](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-version-history).
Authentication |	If Azure AD is not the source of primary authentication for user accounts, you must configure one of these in Azure AD Connect:<br>- Password hash synchronization<br>- Pass-through authentication<br>- An external identity provider (including Windows Server ADFS and non-Microsoft IDPs) configured to meet Azure AD integration requirements. See the [guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56843) for more information. <br><br>When setting authentication options with Azure AD Connect, password writeback is also recommended. For more information, see [Password writeback](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-writeback). <br><br>If an external identity provider is implemented, you must validate the solution:<br>- Meets Azure AD integration requirements<br>- Supports Azure AD Conditional Access, this is to enable MMD Device Compliance Policy to be configured<br>- Enables device enrollment and use of Microsoft 365 services or features required as part of Microsoft Managed Desktop <br><br>For more information on authentication options with Azure AD, see [Azure AD Connect user sign-in options](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-user-signin).
Microsoft 365 |	OneDrive for Business must be enabled for Microsoft Managed Desktop users.<br><br>Though it is not required to enroll with Microsoft Managed Desktop, we highly recommended that the following services be migrated to the cloud:<br>- Email: Migrate to cloud-based mailboxes, Exchange online, or configure with Exchange Online Hybrid with Exchange 2013 or higher, on-premises.<br>- Files and folders: Migrate to OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online.<br>- Online collaboration tools: Migrate to Teams.
Device management | Microsoft Managed Desktop devices require management using Microsoft Intune. Intune must be set as the Mobile Device Management authority.<br><br>For more information, see [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune). 
Data back-up and recovery |	Microsoft Managed Desktop requires files to be synced to OneDrive for Business for protection. Any files not synced to OneDrive for Business are not guaranteed by Microsoft Managed Desktop and might be lost during device exchanges or support calls requiring a device reset.<br><br>Though not required, Microsoft Managed Desktop strongly recommends migration from mapped network drives to the appropriate cloud solution. For more information, see [Prepare mapped drives for Microsoft Managed Desktop](mapped-drives.md)
