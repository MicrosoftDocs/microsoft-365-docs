# Address device name dependency

Microsoft Managed Desktop applies a standardized name format when devices are enrolled and will automatically rename devices if the name is changed later. For more info, see [Device names](../service-description/device-names.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your environment depends on specific device names (for example, to support a particular network configuration), you should investigate options to remove that dependency before enrolling in Microsoft Managed Desktop. If you must keep the name dependency, you can submit a request through the [Admin portal](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md) to disable the renaming function and use your desired name format.
