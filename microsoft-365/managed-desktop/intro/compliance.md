## Auditor reports and compliance certificates

You can find relevant information, including control and technical requirements, in the [Service Trust Portal (STP)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/), the central repository for such information about Microsoft Cloud Service offerings. You can download auditor reports, compliance certificates, and more from the [Audit Reports](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide) section of the STP.

> [!NOTE]
> Because Microsoft Managed Desktop runs on Azure, relevant documents usually have file names such as "Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and other Online Services". In those documents, you can usually find Microsoft Managed Desktop under the category "Microsoft Online Services" or "Monitoring + Management".

## Shared responsibility

Compliance for cloud services is a shared responsibility between cloud service providers and their customers. For more information, see [Shared responsibility in the cloud](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility).
