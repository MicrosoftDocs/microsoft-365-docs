When your organization is enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop, what does Microsoft do for you? And what are your organization's responsibilities?

## Microsoft's roles and responsibilities

Microsoft provides these key roles and responsibilities:

Role or responsibility | Description
--- | ---
MDM policy management | Microsoft will apply MDM policies according to best practices and consider requests for policy changes. We'll also make changes to your tenant as prescribed in [Device policies](../service-description/device-policies.md).
User support | We provide a mechanism for elevated access to devices and for issues to get escalated through a support request if necessary. For more information, see [User support](../service-description/user-support.md).
Microsoft Managed Desktop service support | Microsoft will provide support to your IT department through a Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team. This team will support technical troubleshooting, change requests, and incident management for the customer’s Microsoft Managed Desktop environment. For more information, see [Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md).
Security monitoring | Microsoft will monitor your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If the Microsoft Managed Desktop Security Operations Center (SOC) detects a threat, we will notify you, isolate the device, and rectify the issue remotely. For more information, see [Security](../service-description/security.md).
Update monitoring and management | We actively monitor your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices to ensure that the latest quality and feature updates are installed for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. For more information, see [How updates are handled](../service-description/updates.md).
User and device grouping | Microsoft Managed Desktop operations team will create and manage required device and user groups as part of IT operations. No membership or configuration changes are allowed to these groups. Altering these groups can lead to unexpected configuration of devices and loss of functionality. For any issues or questions around these groups once established, IT administrators can contact Microsoft Managed Desktop operations. For more information, see [Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md).
