# Microsoft Managed Desktop technologies

This article lists the technologies and apps used in Microsoft Managed Desktop.

<!-- Microsoft 365 E5; Device as a Service -->
<!-- in O365 table, standard suite, removed this sentence "Please see the Installation of Project/Visio 64bit Click to Run Addendum for important deployment instructions. -->

Microsoft 365 Enterprise licensing is required for all Microsoft Managed Desktop users. For more information on licensing requirements for the service, see [Prerequisites for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../get-ready/prerequisites.md).

This article summarizes the components included in the required Enterprise licenses, with a description of how the service uses each component with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Specific roles and responsibilities for each area are detailed throughout Microsoft Managed Desktop documentation.
