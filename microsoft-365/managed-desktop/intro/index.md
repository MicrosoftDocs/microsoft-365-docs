# What is Microsoft Managed Desktop?

<!--from Overview-->

We’re always looking for ways to help make our customer’s workplace more productive and secure. Using the Microsoft 365 service starts by empowering employees to work together in a creative, secure, device and app environment.

Microsoft Managed Desktop takes this further by combining the power of Microsoft 365 Enterprise on a modern device, with endpoint management, protection, and security provided and run by Microsoft.
