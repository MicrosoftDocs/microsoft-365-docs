# What is Microsoft Managed Desktop?

<!--from Overview-->

We’re always looking for ways to help make our customer’s workplace more productive and secure. Using the Microsoft 365 service starts by empowering employees to work together in a creative, secure, device and app environment.

Microsoft Managed Desktop brings together Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Device as a Service and cloud-based device management. By using MMD, you will be able to delight users (they get the latest updates and versions of Windows automatically) and free up your IT department (no more patching and keeping devices up-to-date, Microsoft will take care of that). You can focus more on delivering business value, instead of doing IT tasks.

So what happens when you order a device from the Device List? The device will be shipped to you, it will already be tied to the Tenant that was supplied during the order process and so we will know the organization of the PC, we will quickly configure the device, enable Windows Hello and we will make sure that the correct security baseline policies and LoB apps are deployed to the device as well. 
We make the device stateless, be default it comes with OneDrive for Business installed and we make sure it uses the Known Folder Move (KFM) inside OneDrive, so if you lose the device, you can just order a new one and your state will come down from the Cloud through OneDrive for Business and Azure AD Enterprise State Roaming.

Microsoft manages all the updates that happen on the device. You get the best Windows security baselines over the MDM channel, based on feedback from Microsoft engineering teams, Product Group teams and our Partner Network.

Support for MMD devices is provided 24 X 7, and you can log a support call from the device itself.

In terms of licensing, MMD requires a Microsoft 365 E3 license with Identity & Threat Protection (or equivalent licenses).
