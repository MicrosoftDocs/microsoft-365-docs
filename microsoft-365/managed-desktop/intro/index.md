# What is Microsoft Managed Desktop?


Microsoft Managed Desktop is a cloud-based service that brings together [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-overview) (including [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10/) Enterprise and [Office 365 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans)) and adding these features:

- End-user device deployment
- IT service management and operations
- Security monitoring and response
- End-user support

Microsoft Managed Desktop offers a solution for several of the challenges facing businesses and their people today:
- The transition to the agile world of software as a service is daunting.
- End users want an empowered, connected work experience.
- Many current IT management and security processes are outdated, time-intensive, and expensive.
- Businesses want to focus on what makes them uniquely successful, rather than maintaining digital infrastructure.

Your end users will enjoy the latest versions of Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus apps (and more besides), using devices and software that are curated and rigorously tested for best performance and reliability. Also, you'll never have to worry about keeping any of this software up to date because that happens automatically, following a careful rollout sequence that is monitored every step of the way. And registered devices are monitored 24x7 for technical and security issues, so if something goes wrong, help will be on the way.


## Unique to Microsoft Managed Desktop

Of course there's nothing stopping you from obtaining and managing your own devices and Microsoft 365 deployments yourself. So what does Microsoft Managed Desktop offer beyond that?

Our policies and security baseline offers your end users these benefits:

- Boot times for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices about one-fourth as long.
- At least twice the battery life
- About one-third as many device crashes per year
- Device mobility through [Enterprise State Roaming](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/enterprise-state-roaming-overview), allowing users to have the same experience no matter what device to sign into

Your IT admins benefit from these features:

- Insights dashboards constantly keeping you up to date on usage, reliability, device health, and other data on devices and users
- About *one-tenth* the amount of time needed to update 95% of devices
- More time to focus on other IT admin activities, thanks to [device management](#device-management) provided by the service.
- Better awareness of device and app performance and early warning of security issues from [device monitoring](#device-monitoring).

## Device management
Microsoft Managed Desktop takes on the burden of managing registered devices and the Microsoft software they use.

- **Hardware:** Instead of your IT department having to research and test devices (and their drivers), specific devices are carefully tested by Microsoft Managed Desktop, resulting in a curated [list of devices](../service-description/device-list.md) that meet enterprise-level performance requirements and are guaranteed to work with the service. You can either obtain devices yourself (or work with a partner) or reuse devices you already have, provided they are on the approved list. Registering devices is easy and straightforward, and before they're deployed, you can also [customize](../working-with-managed-desktop/config-setting-overview.md) certain aspects of the device experience for your end users.
- **Updates:** Microsoft Managed Desktop sets up and manages all aspects of [deployment groups](../service-description/updates.md) for Windows 10 quality and feature updates, drivers, firmware, anti-virus definitions, and Office ProPlus updates. This includes extensive testing and verification of all updates, assuring that registered devices are always up to date and minimizing disruptions, freeing your IT department from that ongoing task.
- **Apps:** As part of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft provides (and manages) several key Microsoft apps for you. But you probably also have other apps that you need for your business. Instead of your IT department having to test, package, and deploy those apps Microsoft helps you deploy them and can assist with [Desktop App Assure](https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/win-10-desktop-app-assure) if needed. Learn more at [Apps in Microsoft Managed Desktop](../get-ready/apps.md).


## Device monitoring

We help maintain the security of your devices with a dedicated security operations center that monitors your devices and uses data from the unique threats that Microsoft analyzes each month. These security features are built in instead of added on later.

We also monitor device health and provide you with insights about device performance. Learn more at [Microsoft Managed Desktop operations and monitoring](../service-description/operations-and-monitoring.md)
