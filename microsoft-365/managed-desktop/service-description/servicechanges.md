# Service changes and communication

Sometimes, Microsoft might need to change details about the way Microsoft Managed Desktop works. Similarly, you might need to make changes that would affect the service as well. We handle such changes differently depending on how significant they are. This topic defines the changes we consider major, and explains how we handle them versus other changes.



## Changes made by Microsoft

We'll give you notice at least 30 days ahead of time for any major change that requires action. We’ll let you know by using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal messaging system.

**Major changes** are those that might impact any of these areas:
- Changes affecting daily productivity
- Changes to customized features and applications
- Increase or decrease of visible capacity
- Changes in product branding that might cause user confusion or change in helpdesk processes and reference material or URLs
- Changes requiring permissions beyond those required by the service for daily operations, excluding actions that prevent or fix issues
- Changes to where your data is stored
- Adding a new component service or application to the scope of the service
- Removal of a component service or application from the scope of the service
- Adding new feature to the service

> [!NOTE]
> We might have to make changes to mitigate incidents or security issues that would be excluded from the 30-day notification policy.

We’ll routinely make other changes to the service to improve user experience, security, reliability, and reporting. Some examples of these changes include:

- Installation of Windows and Office updates
- Updates to the security baseline applied to devices
- Supported devices. To see recommended devices, filter for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/business/devices) site.

We'll communicate these changes by using established channels. If you have any questions about any changes, contact the Microsoft Managed Desktop [Operations team](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md). Changes to the service are also documented as needed in the [change history](../change-history-managed-desktop.md).

Microsoft Managed Desktop changes and communications are governed by two Microsoft policies:
- [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy)
- [Microsoft 365 Change Communication Policy](/office365/admin/manage/message-center)

## Changes you make

Some changes that you might make in your environment could impact Microsoft Managed Desktop. For these major changes, we ask that you give us at least 30 days’ notice by submitting a service request in the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal. See [Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md) for instructions. This allows us adequate time to plan and prepare for the change to avoid disruptions.

Major changes are those that might impact any of these areas:

- Identity systems and groups
- Networking and network controls such as firewalls, proxy or caching, and VPN systems
- Controls for accessing cloud services configurations
- User or device certificates used for identity or securing of network services
- Management systems that interact with the service
- Security systems or agents that interact with the service
- Configuration of any of the Microsoft 365 cloud services associated with, or used by, the service

These changes aren’t likely to be disruptive, so you don’t need to let us know about them ahead of time:

- Orphaned object cleanup
- Adding or removing users from the service
- Configuration of system that does not have a material impact on the delivery of the Microsoft Managed Desktop
- Application version updates, with the exception of VPN or proxy applications
