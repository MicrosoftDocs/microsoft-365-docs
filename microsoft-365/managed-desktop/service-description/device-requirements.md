# Device requirements

Microsoft Managed Desktop regularly evaluates device requirements to be included in the service. This article describes the hardware and software requirements a device must meet in order to work with Microsoft Managed Desktop. You can review a list of specific devices already approved for use with the service based on these requirements. Filter for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/business/devices) site

> [!NOTE]
> These requirements can change at any time, but we will provide 30 days notice of any hardware requirement changes. The requirements most recently changed are marked with <b>\*</b>. 

## Check hardware requirements

Besides reviewing device specs, you can also use the downloadable [readiness assessment checker](../get-ready/readiness-assessment-downloadable.md) to verify that a given device meets the necessary requirements. This tool also checks network settings and endpoints that are also necessary for the service to work.

## Minimum requirements

To be enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop, a device must meet or exceed all of these requirements.

### Manufacturer

The device must have been made by one of these manufacturers:

- Dell
- HP
