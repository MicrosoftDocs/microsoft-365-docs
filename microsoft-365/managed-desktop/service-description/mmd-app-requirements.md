Microsoft Managed Desktop requires that we manage devices using a specific approach to guarantee the performance, reliability, and serviceability of devices.

|Device configuration or policy management     |  Microsoft Intune       |
|Application management     | Microsoft Intune and Company Portal        |
|Driver deployment     |  Drivers included with the device, Windows Update, or Intune       |

|Network security     | See [Network security](security.md#network-security)        |

Microsoft Managed Desktop might monitor other software running on managed devices. If it negatively impacts device management, device security, performance, or reliability, you might be required to request an [exception to the service plan](customizing.md).
