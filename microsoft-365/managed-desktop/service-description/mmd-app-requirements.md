<!--Application addendum -->
 
Microsoft Managed Desktop requires that we manage devices using a specific approach to guarantee the performance, reliability, and serviceability of devices.


|Management area  |Microsoft Managed Desktop approach  |
|---------|---------|
|Device configuration or policy management     |  Microsoft Intune       |
|Application management     | Microsoft Intune and Company Portal        |
|Driver deployment     |  Drivers included with the device, Windows Update, or Intune       |
|Device security     | See [Device security](security.md#device-security)      |
|Identity and access management     | See [Identity and access management](security.md#identity-and-access-management)        |
|Network security     | See [Network security](security.md#network-security)        |
|Information security     |  See [Information security](security.md#information-security)       |

|Core productivity     | Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise    |
|Browser     | Microsoft Edge        |




Microsoft Managed Desktop might monitor other software running on managed devices. If it negatively impacts device management, device security, performance, or reliability, you might be required to request an [exception to the service plan](customizing.md).
