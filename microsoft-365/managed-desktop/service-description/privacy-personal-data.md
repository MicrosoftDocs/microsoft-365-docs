## Overview
Microsoft Managed Desktop is an IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) service for enterprise cloud customers designed to keep employees’ Windows devices deployed and updated. It also provides IT service management and operations, monitors security and incident response, as well as providing user support. This documentation provides additional details on data platform and privacy compliance for Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data sources and purpose
Microsoft Managed Desktop provides its service to enterprise customers and properly administers customers’ enrolled devices by using data from various sources. These sources, including Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Windows 10, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, provide a comprehensive view of the devices that Microsoft Managed Desktop manages. The service also uses these Microsoft services to enable Microsoft Managed Desktop to provide ITaaS capabilities:

- [Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise](/windows/windows-10/) - for management of device setup experience, managing connections to other services, and operational support for IT pros.
- [Windows Update for Business](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) - uses Windows 10 Enterprise diagnostic data to provide additional information on Windows 10 update. 
- [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](/mem/endpoint-manager-overview) – for device management and to keep your data secure.
  - [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/) - for authentication and identification of all user accounts. 
  - [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/) – for distributing device configurations, device management and application management.
  - [Endpoint Analytics](/mem/analytics/overview) – for analytical insights about device and app usage.
  - [Windows Autopilot](/microsoft-365/windows/windows-autopilot) – for device provisioning and deployment.
  - [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/) – provides security services such as device security monitoring and security intelligence data.
- [Microsoft Managed Desktop](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home)  – Data provided by the customer or generated by the service during running of the service.
- [Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans?rtc=1) – for management of Microsoft 365 Apps.

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data process and storage
Microsoft Managed Desktop relies on data from multiple Microsoft products and services to provide its service to enterprise customers. To accomplish the goal of protecting and maintaining enrolled devices, we process and copy data from these services to Microsoft Managed Desktop. When we process data, we follow the documented directions you provide, as referenced in the Online Services Terms and Microsoft Privacy Statement. When we process data, we follow the documented directions you provide, as referenced in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). Microsoft Managed Desktop’s processor duties include ensuring appropriate confidentiality, security, and resilience. Microsoft Managed Desktop employs additional privacy and security measures to ensure proper handling of personal identifiable data. 

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data storage and staff location
Microsoft Managed Desktop stores its data in the Azure data centers in the United States. Personal data obtained by Microsoft Managed Desktop and other services are required to keep the service operational. If a device is removed from Microsoft Managed Desktop, we keep personal data for a maximum of 30 days except for alert data collected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which is stored for 180 days for security purposes. For more information on data retention, see [Data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview).

Microsoft Managed Desktop Engineering Operations and Security Operations teams are located in the United States and India. 

### Microsoft Windows 10 diagnostic data
Microsoft Managed Desktop uses [Windows 10 Enhanced diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data) to keep Windows secure, up to date, troubleshoot problems, and make product improvements. The enhanced diagnostic data setting includes more detailed information about the devices enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop and their settings, capabilities, and device health. When enhanced diagnostic data is selected, data, including required diagnostic data, are collected. See [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection) for more information about the Windows 10 diagnostic data setting and data collection.

The diagnostic data terminology will change in future versions of Windows. Microsoft Managed Desktop is committed to processing only the data that the service needs. While this will mean the diagnostic level will change to **Optional**, Microsoft Managed Desktop will implement the limited diagnostic policies to fine-tune diagnostic data collection required for the service. For more details, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection).

Microsoft Managed Desktop only processes and stores system-level data from Windows 10 optional diagnostic data originating from enrolled devices such as application and device reliability and performance information. Microsoft Managed Desktop does not process and store customers’ personal data such as chat and browser history, voice, text, or speech data. 

For more information about the diagnostic data collection of Microsoft Windows 10, see the [Where we store and process personal data](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule) section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

## Major data change notification
Microsoft Managed Desktop follows a change control process as outlined in our service communication framework. We notify customers through the Microsoft 365 Message Center and Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal of both security incidents and major changes to the service. Changes to the types of data gathered and where it is stored are considered a material change. We will provide a minimum of 30 days of advanced notification of this change as is standard practice for Microsoft 365 products and services. For more information, see [Service changes and communication](/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/servicechanges?view=o365-worldwide).
