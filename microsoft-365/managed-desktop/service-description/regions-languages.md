# Microsoft Managed Desktop supported regions and languages

This topic provides details about regions and languages supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop. 

- **Regions:** United States, Canada (excluding Quebec), United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand
- **Languages:** English is the only supported language currently available to users on managed devices. This is applicable to both [Admin support](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support) and [End-user support](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/working-with-managed-desktop/end-user-support) options. 

However, customers can still use managed devices outside of the regions listed above without an interruption to the Microsoft Managed Desktop service. For example, an employee based in the United Kingdom can work securely and receive updates on their managed device while traveling Asia, Europe, or South America.

For more information about user support with Microsoft Managed Desktop, see [support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/service-description/support).

If a user prefers to work in a language other than English, they can request that their local IT administrator centrally deploy additional language packs on managed devices through the Intune Company Portal app. Starting with Windows 10, version 1803, language packs are delivered as appx packages from Microsoft Store. To learn more, see [Microsoft Store for Business apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/get-started/deploy-apps#msfb-apps).


>[!NOTE]
>The GetHelp app on a Microsoft Managed Desktop device supports English only. For users to obtain help with Microsoft Managed Desktop through the GetHelp app, they must switch the display language to English.
