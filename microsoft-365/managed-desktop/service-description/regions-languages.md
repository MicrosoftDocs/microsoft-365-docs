# Microsoft Managed Desktop supported regions and languages

This article provides details about regions and languages supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop and the regions where you can use it.

## Supported languages

English is the only language available to users of Microsoft Managed Desktop. This policy includes all user interfaces for both users and administrators and all interactions with both [admin support](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md) and [user support](../working-with-managed-desktop/end-user-support.md).


You can still use managed devices outside of English-speaking regions without any interruption to the Microsoft Managed Desktop service. For example, an employee based in the United Kingdom can work securely and receive updates on their managed device while traveling in Asia, Europe, or South America. 

For more information about user support with Microsoft Managed Desktop, see [Support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](./support.md).
