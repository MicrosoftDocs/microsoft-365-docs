# Microsoft Managed Desktop devices 

Microsoft Managed Desktop regularly evaluates devices to be included in the service. This topic outlines the requirements for a device to be enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop and lists the specific devices that are currently supported.

For more information on Microsoft Managed Desktop, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop documentation and resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/). 

<!-- Microsoft 365 E5; Device as a Service -->
<!-- Split from device & technologies topic. Destination topic for aka.ms/device-list  -->
To be enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop a device must be one of the following models and meet or exceed the listed specifications for RAM, processor family, and disk space. 

The links to devices here are for your reference only. If you want to order devices, work with your commercial channel contacts to ensure that you choose the correct configurations. In this table, the *archive date* is the date on which these models will be subject to a shorter Microsoft Managed Desktop service life; any such devices onboarded after this date will not receive a full three-year term of support from Microsoft Managed Desktop. Archived devices are also listed in [Microsoft Managed Desktop archived devices](archived-device-list.md). *Retirement date* is the date on which this model will no longer be supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop at all. On that date, all enrolled devices of this model will be removed from Microsoft Managed Desktop, no matter when they were enrolled.

>[!NOTE]
>Devices can be added to this table at any time, but we will provide 90 days notice for any changes affecting archive or retirement date. The devices most recently added are marked with **\***.
