# Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Managed Desktop no longer requires device models be from this list. As of May 3, 2021, all devices from an approved manufacturer should meet our posted hardware and software requirements. You can continue to use devices on this list with confidence. You can find more devices recommended for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows 10 Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/view-all-devices) site. At that site, view the recommended devices by expanding **Features** in the **Filter by** area, and then selecting **Microsoft Managed Desktop**. Anytime you plan to enroll a particular device model in the service for the first time, you should test an example to ensure it'll deliver the user experience you expect. For more information, see [Validate new devices](../get-started/validate-device.md).

Microsoft Managed Desktop regularly evaluates devices to be included in the service. This article lists the specific devices that are currently supported. For a more general statement of device requirements, see [Device requirements](device-requirements.md).

For more information on Microsoft Managed Desktop, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop documentation and resources](../index.yml).

To be enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop, a device must be one of the following models and meet or exceed the listed specifications for RAM, processor family, and disk space.

The links to devices here are for your reference only. If you want to order devices, work with your commercial channel contacts to ensure that you choose the correct configurations. In this table, the *archive date* is the date on which these models will be subject to a shorter Microsoft Managed Desktop service life; any such devices onboarded after this date will not receive a full three-year term of support from Microsoft Managed Desktop. Archived devices are also listed in [Microsoft Managed Desktop archived devices](archived-device-list.md). *Retirement date* is the date on which this model will no longer be supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop at all. On that date, all enrolled devices of this model will be removed from Microsoft Managed Desktop, no matter when they were enrolled.

>[!NOTE]
>Devices can be added to this table at any time, but we will provide 90 days notice for any changes affecting archive or retirement date. The devices most recently added are marked with **\***.

- If a specific SKU is listed in the device requirements, make sure you use it when you order. Doing so ensures that devices comply with Microsoft Managed Desktop software requirements.
- Not have completed the Windows first-run experience.
- Be registered with Microsoft Managed Desktop using the [Device Registration](../get-started/register-devices-self.md) feature

>[!NOTE]
>Devices with a 2.0 GHz or faster processor will provide a much better experience for users involved in these activities:
>- Using video conferencing with Teams. See [Hardware requirements for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app) for details.
>-	Using one device for several different workloads.
>- Using multiple monitors.
