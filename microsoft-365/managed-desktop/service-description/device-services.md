# Microsoft Managed Desktop device services

This topic lists the services and service limitations for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

## Device services

Microsoft will provide these services for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. For a list of recommended Microsoft Managed Desktop program devices, filter for Microsoft Managed Desktop on the [Shop Windows 10 Pro business devices](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/view-all-devices) site.

 |Service  | Description  
Support	| Support agents will answer questions directly related to device functionality and diagnose device issues.
Inventory |	All devices are tracked in the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal for inventory and status tracking.
Firmware / driver updates |	By default, Microsoft Managed Desktop devices receive firmware and driver updates from Windows Update. Not all hardware partners deploy their updates via Windows Update. Updates not published as Automatic require an exception and must be deployed by the customer.
Accessories	| Accessories that come with your device are covered by the same services as the device itself, but warranty terms may differ. Refer to the warranty terms chosen when selecting your devices. 
Device setup	| Devices will be pre-configured with the current version of Windows and receive their apps and configurations via the cloud. 

For information on device replacement, upgrades, and support terms, see your agreement with your device provider and your warranty terms.

## Device service limitations

Microsoft will not provide service for these items.

 |Service  | Description  
Personalization | Devices and accessories provided with the service are unable to be customized. All devices and accessories are provided with standard branding, specification, and color combinations. Application deployment and policy configurations are handled through IT-as-a-Service.
Data recovery | User and team data, including personalization, is stored in OneDrive for Business, with only cache data residing locally. If data is intentionally stored on the deviceâ€™s internal storage system, any data recovery must be attempted and completed prior to returning the device to Microsoft.
Device setup | Devices are delivered to the customer address, where they need to be powered on and set up by the customer.
