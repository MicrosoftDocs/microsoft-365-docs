# Microsoft Managed Desktop operations and monitoring

<!-- Operations and monitoring: -->


## Change management

In a service offering, the balance of responsibility for things such as hardware maintenance and security updates shifts to the service provider (Microsoft) instead of the customer (you). However, you still need to ensure that third-party and custom software continues to function as expected when updates are rolled out.

For on-premises products, your organization assumes all responsibility for managing change.

### Balance of responsibility

Responsibility | Microsoft Managed Desktop service | Microsoft 365 client software | On-premises clients and servers | 3rd party and custom software
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Provide new functionality | Microsoft | Microsoft | Both | Customer
Test new features for quality assurance |  Microsoft | Microsoft | Both | Customer
Communicate about new features | Both | Both | Both | Customer
Integrate custom software | Both | Both | Customer | Customer
Apply security updates | Microsoft | Microsoft | Customer | Customer
Maintain system software | Microsoft | Microsoft | Customer | Customer
Package for deployment | Microsoft | Microsoft | Customer | Customer


### Change process overview

Hereâ€™s a summary of how the change process is shared between Microsoft and customers.

### Change types

There are several types of changes that are made to the service on a regular basis. The communication channel for those changes and the actions that customers are responsible for varies.

Not all changes have the same impact on your users or require action. Some are planned and some unplanned by their nature (non-security updates and security updates aren't usually planned). Depending on the type of change, the communication channel may vary. The following table lists the types of changes you can expect for the Microsoft Managed Desktop service.

|   | Functionality |	Non-security updates |	Security
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Type of change** | - Feature updates<br>- New features or applications<br>- Deprecated features | Client hotfixes for issues | Security patches
**Advance notice** | 5 days notice for changes that require action |	No, these are included in the monthly release	| No, these are included in the monthly release 
**Communication channel** | - Message Center<br>- Email alert | - Message Center<br>- Email alert | - Message Center<br>- Email alert
**Requires global admin action** | Sometimes |	Rarely |	Rarely 
**Type of action** | Change settings | Communicate changes to users | Change admin settings 	
**Requires testing** | Check business applications, including remote access services |	Sometimes - testing the fix against processes or customizations |	Rarely 
**Examples of change** | - Feature updates: IT Admin Portal simplified support ticket submission and review<br>- New features or applications: Semi-annual release of a Windows 10 feature update |	Hotfixes based on customer reported bugs |	


## Standard operating procedures

The Microsoft Managed Desktop service is implemented and operated by Microsoft in your Microsoft cloud instance where you may conduct other administrative activities. Microsoft is solely responsible for Microsoft Managed Desktop-specific setup, configuration and operation. 

For on-premises products, your organization takes on all the responsibility for managing setup,and configuration and operational activities.

Categories |	Microsoft will | Customer will
--- | --- | ---
Network (proxy, packet inspection, VPN)  | Advise and plan with customers to minimize risk to business users. | - Create a support request requesting information for a planned configuration change, including configuration details, scope, timeline and other pertinent details for Microsoft to review.<br>- Only apply a change once Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations has assessed and advised.
Service accounts |- Implement, securely store, and manage the credentials.<br> - Communicate unauthorized access or use of these credentials to your Security Operations team. | - Create a support request requesting information for a planned configuration change, including configuration details, scope, timeline and other pertinent details for Microsoft to review.<br>- Only apply a change once Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations has assessed and advised.<br>- Not assign policy, multi-factor authentication, conditional access, or application deployment to the Microsoft Managed Desktop Service Accounts.<br>- Not reset the password or use the credentials.<br>- Open a Sev C support request to Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations if suspicious activity is observed in Intune or Azure audit logs, related to these service accounts.
Device Groups |	- Implement and manage the membership of devices within Microsoft Managed Desktop groups.<br>- Use the Microsoft Managed Desktop groups to manage the assignment and release of configuration and updates to devices. | - Create a support request requesting information for a planned configuration change, including configuration details, scope, timeline and other pertinent details for Microsoft to review.<br>- Only apply a change once Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations has assessed and advised.<br>- Not modify the membership of any Microsoft Managed Desktop group.<br>- Only use the groups to assign corporate certificates for services such as VPN, Windows Hello for Business or email encryption, or corporate Wi-Fi profile configuration.<br>- Where co-management exists, explicitly exclude all Microsoft Managed Desktop groups when deploying the Configuration Manager client.
Policies |	- Implement and manage the Microsoft Managed Desktop policies that govern the configuration state of devices within service.<br>- Deploy updates, to policy or Windows, incrementally using Device Groups.<br> - Explicitly exclude targeting non-Microsoft Managed Desktop groups. | - Create a support request requesting information for a planned configuration change, including configuration details, scope, timeline and other pertinent details for Microsoft to review.<br>- Only apply a change once Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations has assessed and advised.<br>- Not edit or assign Microsoft Managed Desktop policies to devices or users not managed by the Microsoft Managed Desktop service.
Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection	| Monitor and investigate devices within the scope of the Microsoft Managed Desktop service. | - Create a support request requesting information for a planned configuration change, including configuration details, scope, timeline and other pertinent details for Microsoft to review.<br>- Only apply a change once Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations has assessed and advised

## Device wipe with factory reset

The Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team can perform a factory reset of devices enrolled in the service when required. This is helpful if you need to give a device to a different employee, or if an employee leaves your company. 

There are a few requirements:

- Your global administrator must submit a service request.
- Include the device's computer name in the request.
- The user account must be in Azure AD before we reset the device.

Managed Desktop Operations team will do the following:

- Look up the device name in Intune
- Send the factory reset command to the device

>[!NOTE]
>Do not remove the user account from Azure AD before the device is reset. If the user isnâ€™t in Azure AD, Intune canâ€™t send the factory reset command to the device. 

The device will boot into the "out of box experience," and all preinstalled applications and settings will be applied again. The user of the device needs to provide initial setup information again. 

When the device has been reset, you can give it to a different person in your organization. None of the previous userâ€™s data or enterprise data will be on the device. The next user will go through the same process that the previous person did with a new Microsoft Managed Desktop device.

BitLocker is a key component of data security in this process. With BitLocker encryption on Microsoft Managed Desktop devices, data on the drive remains secure even after the device as been factory-reset. Any data that was on the drive will not be available to the next user of the device. For more information, see [BitLocker overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview).
