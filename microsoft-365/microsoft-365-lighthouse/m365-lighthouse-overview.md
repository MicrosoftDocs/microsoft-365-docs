# Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md).

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers who are using Microsoft 365 Business Premium. 

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse simplifies onboarding of Microsoft 365 Business Premium tenants by recommending security configuration baselines tailored to SMB customers and providing multi-tenant views across all customer environments. With Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, partners can scale the management of their customers, focus on what's most important, quickly find and investigate risks, and take action to get their customers to a healthy and secure state.

No additional costs are associated with using Microsoft 365 Lighthouse to manage Microsoft 365 services and connected devices. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is currently in preview and available to MSPs enrolled in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and serving SMB customers with a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription.

Note that CSP indirect providers aren't currently supported by Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Partners must have a CSP relationship and establish Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP) with customers through Partner Center for customers to be active within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Customers also must have at least one Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription and fewer than 500 licensed users in their tenant.     

For more information about the CSP program, see the [Cloud Solution Provider program overview](/partner-center/csp-overview).

> [!NOTE]  
> A similar offering, Azure Lighthouse, helps service providers deliver managed services for Azure services by using comprehensive and robust management tooling built into the Azure platform. To learn more, see the [Azure Lighthouse documentation](/azure/lighthouse/).   

## Microsoft 365 Lighthouse benefits

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse helps partners secure and manage Microsoft 365 services and connected endpoints at scale by:

- Providing tenant deployment journeys so technicians can follow a consistent set of steps to secure and configure customer tenants. 
- Using a default SMB security baseline that prescribes best practices targeted to small- and medium-sized business tenants. 
- Providing multi-tenant insights on device compliance for a clear view of how devices are being evaluated across all organizations, tools to compare policies, and the top settings that aren't being met. 
- Simplifying common tasks like resetting a password.
- Configuring multifactor authentication and self-service password reset, including tools to help drive adoption by users. 
- Understanding and protecting against risky sign-ins.
- Managing threats on Windows 10 devices by providing details on threats detected by Microsoft Defender and actions to take to resolve issues and keep devices up to date.   
- Providing insights into Microsoft 365 service incidents and advisories that impact the customer tenants they manage.
