# Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Users page overview 

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md).

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you manage users across tenant accounts by selecting **Users** in the left navigation pane to open the Users page. From this page, you can search for users and assess and act on the security state of your user accounts. You can also view insights into risky users and the status of multifactor authentication and self-service password reset.  
  
## Search users tab  
  
From the Search users tab, you can quickly search across tenants for specific users and perform basic user management actions such as resetting an account password.

## Risky users tab

The Risky Users tab shows user accounts across your tenants that have been flagged for risky behavior. Select any of the users to view more information on a detected risk or to mitigate a risk by resetting a user's password or blocking sign-in.

The Multifactor Authentication tab provides detailed information on the status of multifactor authentication (MFA) enablement across your tenants. Select any tenant in the list to see more details for that tenant, including which Conditional Access policies requiring MFA are already configured and which users have not yet registered for MFA.
