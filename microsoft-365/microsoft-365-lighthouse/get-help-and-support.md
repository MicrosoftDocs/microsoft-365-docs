# Get help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse 

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the requirements. If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](sign-up-m365-lighthouse.md).

Several options are available to you if you need help. Start by checking the current health of your services. Select **Service health** in the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal and you'll see detailed information about current and past issues. If you're experiencing an issue that isn't listed, follow the instructions in this article to view self-help options or to open a service request.

> [!NOTE]
> Support is limited to English while Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is in Preview.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant you're signed into.

- If you need to open a service request, gather as many details as possible about your issue, such as diagnostic logs, tenant ID, and user IDs (if specific users are affected).

## Access help and support

1.  In Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, select the **?** icon at the top of the portal to open the **Help** pane, and then do one of the following:
    
    -  If you're on the page of the portal where the issue occurred, select **Show diagnostics**.

        This will create a JSON file with information to help support agents troubleshoot your issue. Save the file so you can attach it to your service request.

    -  If your issue isn't isolated to the current page of the portal, go to the next step.

2.  In the **Help** pane, select the **Help + support** button. This opens the **How can we help?** pane.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **How can we help?** pane doesn't open, you'll need to reach out to someone in your partner tenant who has Global Administrator permissions and ask them to help.

3.  In the **How can we help?** pane, enter a description of your issue, and then press **Enter**. We recommend including the term *lighthouse* in your description to ensure the search results include relevant help articles.

4.  Check out the list of recommended articles to see if any of them help resolve your issue.

    If you enter a description of your issue and it doesn't return a list of help articles, rephrase your description and try another search.

5.  If the recommended articles don't help, select **Contact Support**.

6.  Fill out the information in the form, attach any screenshots and the JSON file that you saved in step 1 if applicable, and then select **Contact me**. The expected wait time is indicated in the pane.
