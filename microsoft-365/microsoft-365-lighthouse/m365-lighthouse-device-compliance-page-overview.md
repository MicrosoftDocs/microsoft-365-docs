# Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Device compliance page overview

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-sign-up.md).

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you view insights and information related to Intune device compliance for all your tenants by selecting **Devices** in the left navigation pane to open the Device compliance page. From this page, you can get an overview of compliance status across tenants, view a list of devices for each tenant, and get status reports on compliance policies and settings.

## Overview tab  
  
On the Overview tab, you can view device compliance status across your tenants, see monthly device compliance trends, and track whether devices have compliance policies assigned to them. You can also view information on tenant device compliance actions and requirements based on Conditional Access policies.

## Devices tab

On the Devices tab, you can view a list of all tenant devices and filter the list based on the following compliance statuses: Compliant, Non-compliant, In Grace period, and Not evaluated. For more information about the different compliance statuses, see [Monitor Intune Device compliance policies](/mem/intune/protect/compliance-policy-monitor).

Select any device to view more information on why the device is in its current compliance state. If you need to take action on the device, there's an option to view the device in Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

## Policies tab

On the Policies tab, you can view compliance policies across your tenants and compare two or three policies of the same platform type by using the Compare feature on the toolbar. You can also select any policy to view more information.
