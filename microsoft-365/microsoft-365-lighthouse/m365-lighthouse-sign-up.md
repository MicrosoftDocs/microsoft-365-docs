# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are in Preview, are subject to change, and are only available to partners who meet the [requirements](m365-lighthouse-requirements.md). If your organization does not have Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, follow the instructions in this article to sign up.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant you're signing into.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Partners must have a CSP relationship and establish Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP) with customers through Partner Center for customers to be active within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Customers also must have at least one Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription and less than 500 licensed users in their tenant.   

## Steps to sign up to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>. 

1. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services** > **Other Services**.

    If Microsoft 365 Lighthouse isn't in the services list, select **See all other services products**.

    If you encounter the Purchase services error page, select **View products** at the bottom of the page.

1. Under **Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for Partners Public Preview**, select **Details**. 

1. Select **Buy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requires one license for the tenant. No additional per-user licenses are required. 

    To verify that Microsoft 365 Lighthouse was successfully added to your tenant, look for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse under **Billing > Your Products** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. If you aren't redirected to the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal, go to `https://lighthouse.microsoft.com/`.

1. Select **Agree & Continue** to complete the partner agreement amendment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you complete sign up, it can take up to 48 hours for customer data to appear in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.
