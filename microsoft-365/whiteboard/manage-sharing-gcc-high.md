# Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard in GCC High environments

The sharing experience differs based on the device and client being used. 

## Share in Teams meetings

When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone within the organization. It then automatically shares the whiteboard with any in-tenant users in the meeting.

>[!NOTE]
> External sharing during a Teams meeting is not yet available, but will be added in a future release.

|Scenario |Storage and ownership |Sharing settings |Sharing experience |

|Start the whiteboard from a Surface Hub or Microsoft Teams Rooms |Not yet available |         |         |

## Add as a tab in Teams channels and chats

When you add a whiteboard as a tab in a Teams channel or chat, Whiteboard will create a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone in the organization.
