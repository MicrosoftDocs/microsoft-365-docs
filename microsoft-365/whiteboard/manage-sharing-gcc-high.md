# Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard in GCC High environments

>[!NOTE]
> This guidance applies to US Government Community Cloud (GCC) High environments.

The sharing experience differs based on the device and client being used. 

## Share in Teams meetings

When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone within the organization. It then automatically shares the whiteboard with any in-tenant users in the meeting.

>[!NOTE]
> External sharing during a Teams meeting is not yet available, but will be added in a future release.

|Scenario |Storage and ownership |Sharing settings |Sharing experience |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Start the whiteboard from a desktop or mobile device |Storage: OneDrive for Business<br><br>Owner: User who creates the whiteboard |Not yet available |In-tenant users: Can create, view, and collaborate<br><br>External users: Not yet available<br><br>Shared device accounts: Not yet available |
|Start the whiteboard from a Surface Hub or Microsoft Teams Rooms |Not yet available |         |         |

## Add as a tab in Teams channels and chats

When you add a whiteboard as a tab in a Teams channel or chat, Whiteboard will create a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone in the organization.

|Scenario  |Storage and ownership  |Sharing settings  |Sharing experience  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Add the whiteboard to a channel or chat from a desktop or mobile device  |Storage: OneDrive for Business<br><br>Owner: User who creates the whiteboard  |Not applicable  |In-tenant users: Can initiate, view, and collaborate<br><br>External users: Not supported  |

## Create and share in Whiteboard native clients

When you share a whiteboard from the web, desktop, or mobile clients, you can choose specific people. You can also create a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone in the organization.
