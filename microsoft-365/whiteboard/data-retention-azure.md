# Data retention in Microsoft Whiteboard

Whiteboard stores content securely in Azure. Data might be stored in different locations, depending on the country. To check where data for your tenant is stored, see [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations).

Migrating previously created content and supporting additional regional datacenters is on the roadmap.
