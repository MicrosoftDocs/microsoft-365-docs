# Enable and manage access to Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization

>[!NOTE]
> This article applies to Enterprise or Education organizations who use Whiteboard. For US Government GCC High environments, see [Enable and manage access to Microsoft Whiteboard for GCC High environments](enable-whiteboard-access-gcc-high.md).

Microsoft Whiteboard is a visual collaboration canvas where people, content, and ideas come together. Today, Whiteboard runs on Azure for Enterprise and Education customers. Whiteboard is transitioning to be run on top of OneDrive for Business. This transition will bring many new capabilities and allow you to create, share, discover, and manage whiteboards as easily as any Office document.

Whiteboard is automatically enabled for applicable Microsoft 365 tenants. 

Whiteboard conforms to global standards including SOC 1, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and EU Model Clauses. 

The following admin settings are required for Whiteboard:

- Whiteboard must be enabled globally in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- The <code>Set-SPOTenant -IsWBFluidEnabled</code> cmdlet must be enabled using [SharePoint Online PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

>[!NOTE]
> The roll out of OneDrive for Business storage is in progress. When you go to the Microsoft 365 admin center, the option to opt in or out of OneDrive for Business storage is disabled if your tenant already has been transitioned to OneDrive for Business.

You can control access to Whiteboard in the following ways:

- Enable or disable Whiteboard for your entire tenant using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Show or hide Whiteboard for specific users in meetings using a Teams meeting policy. It will still be visible via the web, native clients, and the Teams tab app.

- Require conditional access policies for accessing Whiteboard using the Azure Active Directory admin center.

>[!NOTE]
> Teams meeting policies only hide Whiteboard entry points; it doesn't prevent the users from using Whiteboard. Conditional access policies prevent any access to Whiteboard, but doesn't hide the entry points.

4. On the Whiteboard panel, toggle **Turn Whiteboard on or off for your entire organization** to **On**.

5. Select **Save**.

6. Connect to [SharePoint Online PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

7. Enable Fluid using the following <code>Set-SPOTenant</code> cmdlet:

   <pre><code class="lang-powershell">Set-SPOTenant -IsWBFluidEnabled $true</code></pre>
