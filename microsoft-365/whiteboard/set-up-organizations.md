# Set up Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization

Whiteboard is automatically enabled for applicable Microsoft 365 tenants. Users can sign into the Windows 10, iOS, web, and Teams experiences, unless you’ve chosen to disable the service.

To enable or disable Whiteboard for your tenant, do the following:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

2. On the admin center home page, go to the **Search** box in the top right, and then type *Whiteboard*.

3. In the search results, click or tap **Whiteboard settings**.

4. On the **Whiteboard** panel, toggle **Turn Whiteboard on or off for your entire organization** to **On**. 

5. Click or tap **Save**.
