# Changing from a Microsoft 365 E plan to a Microsoft 365 F plan

If you're considering switching some of your users from a Microsoft 365 E plan to a Microsoft 365 [F3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline-plans-and-pricing) or [F1](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline-plans-and-pricing) plan, this article provides guidance to help you prepare your organization for the change. Changing from an E plan to an F plan affects the services and features users have access to.

E plans are meant for information workers (employees who typically work at a desk) and F plans are meant for frontline workers (employees who are on the go, often on mobile devices, and work directly with customers or the general public). Each plan may continue to evolve over time to become more tailored for information workers and frontline workers respectively. To learn more, see [Understand frontline worker user types and licensing](flw-licensing-options.md).

You'll get an overview of what to expect when users are switched to an F plan, how to prepare for the change, and what to do after switching plans to transition the frontline workers in your organization.

## Understand the key differences between E and F plans

Start by getting familiar with the service and feature differences between the plans.

Some key differences include:

- F plans don't include Microsoft 365 desktop apps.
- F plans are limited to devices with integrated screens smaller than 10.9 inches on Microsoft 365 for mobile apps.
- F plans with Teams [pin frontline worker apps](pin-teams-apps-based-on-license.md) like Viva Connections as a home experience, Walkie Talkie, Shifts, Planner, and Approvals by default in Teams.

In this section, we provide more information about these key differences and highlight some other differences to pay attention to. Keep in mind that this isn't a comprehensive list. To learn more:

- See [Modern work plan comparison](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2139145) for a detailed comparison of what's included in E and F plans.
- See [service availability](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-plan-options#service-availability-within-each-microsoft-365-and-office-365-plan) and [feature availability across plans](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-platform-service-description#feature-availability-across-some-plans) for a list of service and feature availability across E and F plans.

### Microsoft 365 apps

Desktop client apps aren't included in F3 and F1 plans. Your frontline workers can use Microsoft 365 for the web and Microsoft 365 mobile apps to get things done. Keep in mind that F3 users have full access to documents in Microsoft 365 for the web and mobile apps and F1 users have read-only access.

<sup>1</sup>Limited to devices with integrated screens less than 10.9 inches.

#### Microsoft 365 for the web

With Microsoft 365 for the web, your frontline workers use a web browser to open Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint files.

Here's some differences to be aware when using Microsoft 365 for the web. For a detailed feature comparison between Microsoft 365 for the web and desktop apps, see the [service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-online-service-description/office-online-service-description).

#### Microsoft 365 for mobile

Your frontline workers can get Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on their mobile devices in two ways:

- Install the Microsoft 365 mobile app that combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
- Install individual mobile apps for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.

To learn more, see [Install and set up Microsoft 365 apps on Android](https://support.microsoft.com/office/install-and-set-up-office-on-an-android-cafe9d6f-8b0c-4b03-b20a-12438a82a22d) and [Install and set up Microsoft 365 apps on an iPhone or iPad](https://support.microsoft.com/office/install-and-set-up-office-on-an-iphone-or-ipad-9df6d10c-7281-4671-8666-6ca8e339b628).

For more information about the features that are available in Microsoft 365 apps on mobile devices, see [What you can do in Microsoft 365 apps on mobile devices with a Microsoft 365 subscription](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-you-can-do-in-the-microsoft-365-apps-on-mobile-devices-with-a-microsoft-365-subscription-9ef8b63a-05fd-4f9c-bac5-29da046833ea).

#### Email

F3 users have a 2 GB mailbox that they can access through Outlook on the web. For a feature comparison between Outlook on the web and the Outlook desktop app, see [Compare Outlook for PC, Outlook on the web, and Outlook for iOS & Android](https://support.microsoft.com/office/compare-outlook-for-pc-outlook-on-the-web-and-outlook-for-ios-android-b26a7bf5-0ac7-48ba-97af-984e0645dde5).

F1 users don't have mailbox rights. Although a mailbox is provisioned for users through the Exchange Kiosk plan, they aren't entitled to use it. We recommend that you [disable Outlook on the web](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/enable-or-disable-outlook-web-app) for F1 users.

#### Teams

F3 and F1 plans with Teams include the Teams desktop app, mobile app, and web app for frontline worker communication and collaboration. With an F3 or F1 plan that includes Teams, your frontline workers have access to Teams features including meetings, chat, channels, content, and apps. However, they won't be able to use Teams Phone capabilities without the purchase of an additional add-on.

## What to expect

The following table lists important things to consider and recommended actions to take during the change process. Use this information to help you identify what to do before the switch and what to plan for after the switch is completed.

We'll be referring to this table in later sections of this article.

## Prepare to switch plans

### Create a change management strategy

An optimal change management strategy includes how you'll communicate with, train, and support your users before and after you switch them to an F plan. For example, here are a few things to consider:

- How will users be aware of the switch?
- How will users learn to navigate the differences in services and features? The switch to an F plan might need an increased effort in training as it requires a change in behavior.
- How will users get help and support?

When building your strategy, consider communication and training preferences. To help ensure a successful transition, tailor your messaging, training, and support to the specific needs of your frontline workforce and company culture.

Here's some ideas to help plan your strategy.

|Communication|Training|Support|
|---------|---------|---------|
|<ul><li>Email</li><li>Department or store managers</li><li>Champions</li><li>Teams and channels</li><li>Viva Engage communities</li></ul> |<ul><li>Microsoft online help, training, and video resources</li><li>In-house training</li></ul>|<ul><li>In-house helpdesk</li><li>Self-serve intranet site</li><li>Microsoft online help, training, and video resources</li><li>Floor walkers and champions</li></ul>         |

You might also want to check out these adoption resources to help you engage and train your users:

- [Microsoft 365 – Microsoft Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/)
- [Teams for frontline workers – Microsoft Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/frontline-workers/)

### Back up or prepare data

Identify and back up or prepare data that users want to keep. Follow the guidance in the [What to expect](#what-to-expect) section earlier in this article and complete the recommended actions in the **Before the switch** column of the table for each of the following components:

- Microsoft 365 apps
- Email, Exchange, Outlook
- Teams
- OneDrive

For more information, see [Back up data before changing plans](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/move-users-different-subscription#back-up-data-before-changing-microsoft-365-for-business-plans).

## Switch users to a Microsoft 365 F plan

You can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manually change plans or a scripted approach through PowerShell cmdlets. Whichever method you choose, it's important to complete the license change assignment in one operation. In other words, remove an existing E license and replace it by assigning an F license in the same operation.

Avoid removing an existing license for a user and then reassigning a new one at a later point in time. Doing this can affect a user's data. To learn more, see [What happens to a user's data when you remove their license?](../admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md#what-happens-to-a-users-data-when-you-remove-their-license).

For step-by-step guidance on how to change plans in the Microsoft admin center, see [Change plans manually](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/upgrade-to-different-plan#change-plans-manually).

## What to do after switching plans

Follow the guidance in the [What to expect](#what-to-expect) section earlier in this article and complete the recommended actions in the **After the switch** column of the table for each of the following components:

- Microsoft 365 apps
- Email, Exchange, Outlook
- Teams
- OneDrive

Communicate to your users that the change is completed and let them know how to get help as defined in your change management strategy. You might want to include links to [help and learning resources](#user-setup-help-and-learning-resources) to support them in the transition.

## User setup, help, and learning resources

Here are some links to set up, help, and learning resources that you can share with your frontline workforce for training and support.
