Let your customers know what to expect with virtual appointments by answering common questions. All you need to do is edit this Q&A to align with your virtual appointment policies, and paste it on your website.

### Virtual appointments basics

**What is a virtual appointment?**

A virtual appointment is an online appointment conducted over Microsoft Teams. You’ll be speaking one-on-one with one of our staff members, just like you would for an in-person visit.

**How are virtual appointments different than in-person visits?**

Let your customers know if there are differences in the services you provide virtually and in person. You can also describe any fee differences between virtual and in-person appointments.

**How does a virtual appointment go?**

When you join from the link in the email confirmation, you'll enter a virtual waiting room. Once a staff member joins the call, you'll enter a virtual room with them where your one-on-one visit will take place.

**How does payment work for virtual appointments?**

Let your customers know if you accept different types of payment for virtual Appointments.

### Booking an appointment

**How do I make an appointment?**

Link to your organization’s booking page. Let your customers know if there are alternative ways of making virtual appointments, such as over the phone, through email, or through social media.

**Who can I make an appointment with?**

Make sure your clients can maintain relationships with their preferred providers by sharing which, if any, staff members are operating exclusively virtually or in-person.

**How do I cancel or reschedule a virtual appointment?**

You can link to your organization’s cancellation and rescheduling policy here, or describe any differences in the policy between virtual and in-person appointments.

### Technology

**What equipment do I need for a virtual appointment?**

Customers can join a virtual appointment from any web browser or through the Microsoft Teams app. List here if your organization has additional specifications, such as a high-quality webcam or microphone. If your healthcare organization has EHR integrated into teams, patients can join visits from your healthcare portal.

**How do I join a virtual appointment?**

You can link your customers here Join a Bookings appointment as an attendee (microsoft.com) to show them a detailed video and step-by-step process of how to join an appointment.
