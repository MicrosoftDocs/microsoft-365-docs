# Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

## Overview

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM). After you set up a connection, your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in Blue Yonder WFM from within Shifts.

You can use the [Shifts connector wizard](shifts-connector-wizard.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center or [PowerShell](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-powershell-setup.md) to set up a connection. After a connection is set up, you manage it by using [Shifts connector PowerShell cmdlets](#shifts-connector-cmdlets).

This article describes how to use PowerShell to do the following:

- [Check connection setup status](#check-connection-setup-status)
- [View an error report for a connection](#view-an-error-report-for-a-connection)
- [Resolve connection errors](#resolve-connection-errors)
- [Change connection settings](#change-connection-settings)
- [Unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection](#unmap-a-team-from-one-connection-and-map-it-to-another-connection)
- [Disable sync for a connection](#disable-sync-for-a-connection)

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes that you've already set up a connection to Blue Yonder WFM, either by using the wizard or PowerShell.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-admin-role](includes/shifts-connector-admin-role.md)]

## Set up your environment

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you follow these steps to set up your environment before running any of the commands or scripts in this article.

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-set-up-environment](includes/shifts-connector-set-up-environment.md)]

7. Connect to Teams.

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams
    ```

    When you're prompted, sign in using your admin credentials. You're now set up to run the scripts in this article and Shifts connector cmdlets.

## Check connection setup status

<a name="setup_status"> </a>

To check the status of the connection you set up using the operation ID that you received in email:

1. [Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already).
1. Run the following command. This command gives you the overall status of the team mappings for the connection.

    ``` powershell
    Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionOperation -OperationId <YourOperationId>
    ```

To learn more, see [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionOperation](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionoperation).

## View an error report for a connection

<a name="error_report"> </a>

You can run a report that shows error details for a connection. The report lists team and user mappings that succeeded and failed. It also provides information about any issues related to the accounts associated with the connection.

1. [Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already).
1. Get a list of error reports for a connection.

    ``` powershell
    Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionErrorReport -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId>
    ```

1. To view a specific error report, run the following command:

    ``` powershell
    Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionErrorReport -ErrorReportId <ErrorReportId>
    ```

To learn more, see [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionErrorReport](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionerrorreport).

## Resolve connection errors

### User mapping errors

User mapping errors may occur if one or more users in a Blue Yonder WFM instance isn't a member of the mapped team in Teams. To resolve this issue, make sure that the users in the mapped team match the users in the Blue Yonder WFM instance.

To view details of unmapped users, [set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell
#View sync errors script
Write-Host "View sync errors"
Start-Sleep 1

#Ensure Teams module is of version x
Write-Host "Checking Teams module version"
try {
    Get-InstalledModule -Name "MicrosoftTeams" -MinimumVersion 4.1.0
} catch {
    throw
}

#List connection instances available
Write-Host "Listing connection instances"
$InstanceList = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance
write $InstanceList

#Get an instance
if ($InstanceList.Count -gt 0){
    $InstanceId = Read-Host -Prompt 'Input the instance ID that you want to retrieve user sync results from'
}
else {
    throw "Instance list is empty"
}

#Get a list of the mappings
Write-Host "Listing team mappings"
$mappings = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId
write $mappings

#For each mapping, retrieve the failed mappings
ForEach ($mapping in $mappings){
    $teamsTeamId = $mapping.TeamId
    $wfmTeamId = $mapping.WfmTeamId
    Write-Host "Failed mapped users in the mapping of ${teamsTeamId} and ${wfmTeamId}:"
    $userSyncResult = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionSyncResult -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId -TeamId $teamsTeamId
    Write-Host "Failed AAD users:"
    write $userSyncResult.FailedAadUser
    Write-Host "Failed WFM users:"
    write $userSyncResult.FailedWfmUser
}
```

### Account authorization errors

Account authorization errors may occur if the Blue Yonder WFM service account or Microsoft 365 system account credentials are incorrect or don't have the required permissions.

To change your Blue Yonder WFM service account or Microsoft 365 system account credentials for the connection, you can run the [Set-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance) cmdlet or use the PowerShell script in the [Change connection settings](#change-connection-settings) section of this article.

## Change connection settings
<a name="change_settings"> </a>

Use this script to change connection settings. Settings that you can change include your Blue Yonder WFM service account and password, Microsoft 365 system account, team mappings, and sync settings.

Sync settings include the sync frequency (in minutes) and the schedule data that's synced between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. Schedule data is defined in the following parameters, which you can view by running [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector).

- The **enabledConnectorScenarios** parameter defines data that's synced from Blue Yonder WFM to Shifts. Options are `Shift`, `SwapRequest`, `UserShiftPreferences`, `OpenShift`, `OpenShiftRequest`, `TimeOff`, `TimeOffRequest`.
- The **enabledWfiScenarios** parameter defines data that's synced from Shifts to Blue Yonder WFM. Options are `SwapRequest`, `OpenShiftRequest`, `TimeOffRequest`, `UserShiftPreferences`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose not to sync open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, or time off requests between Shifts and Blue Yonder WFM, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts. After you run this script, make sure you follow the steps in the [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests](#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests) section later in this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For settings that you don't want to change, you'll need to re-enter the original settings when you're prompted by the script.

[Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow these steps only if you chose to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, or time off requests using the script in the [Change connection settings](#change-connection-settings) section earlier in this article or by using the [Set-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance) cmdlet. Completing this step hides the capability in Shifts. Without this second step, users will still see the capability in Shifts, and will get an "unsupported operation" error message if they try to use it.

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use the Graph API [schedule resource type](/graph/api/resources/schedule) to set the following parameters to ```false``` for each team that you mapped to a Blue Yonder WFM instance:

- Open shifts: ```openShiftsEnabled```
- Swap requests:  ```swapShiftsRequestsEnabled```
- Time off requests: ```timeOffRequestsEnabled```

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to **Settings** in Shifts, and then turn off the **Open shifts** setting.

## Unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft 365 system account must be the same for both connections. If it isn't, you'll get a "This designated actor profile doesn't have team ownership privileges" error message.

If you want to unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection:

1. [Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already).
1. View a list of all team mappings for a connection.

    ```powershell
    Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId>
    ```

1. Remove a team mapping from the connection.

    ```powershell
    Remove-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId> -TeamId <TeamId>
    ```

1. Map the team to another connection.

    ```powershell
    New-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId> -TeamId <TeamId> -WfmTeamId <SiteId> -TimeZone <TimeZone>
    ```

To learn more, see [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionteammap), [Remove-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap](/powershell/module/teams/remove-csteamsshiftsconnectionteammap), and [New-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftsconnectionteammap).

## Disable sync for a connection

Use this script to disable sync for a connection. Keep in mind this script doesn't remove or delete a connection. It turns off sync so that no data is synced between Shifts and Blue Yonder WFM for the connection that you specify.

[Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell
#Disable sync script
Write-Host "Disable sync"
#Ensure Teams module is at least version x
Write-Host "Checking Teams module version"
try {
    Get-InstalledModule -Name "MicrosoftTeams" -MinimumVersion 4.1.0
} catch {
    throw
}

#List connection instances available
Write-Host "Listing connection instances"
$InstanceList = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance
write $InstanceList

#Get an instance
if ($InstanceList.Count -gt 0){
    $InstanceId = Read-Host -Prompt 'Input the instance ID that you want to disable sync'
    $Instance = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId
    $Etag = $Instance.etag
    $InstanceName = $Instance.Name
    $DesignatedActorId = $Instance.designatedActorId
    $adminApiUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingAdminApiUrl
    $cookieAuthUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingCookieAuthUrl
    $essApiUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingEssApiUrl
    $federatedAuthUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingFederatedAuthUrl
    $retailWebApiUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingRetailWebApiUrl
    $siteManagerUrl = $Instance.ConnectorSpecificSettingSiteManagerUrl
    $ConnectorAdminEmail = $Instance.ConnectorAdminEmail
}
else {
    throw "Instance list is empty"
}

#Remove scenarios in the mapping
Write-Host "Disabling scenarios in the team mapping"
$UpdatedInstanceName = $InstanceName + " - Disabled"
$BlueYonderId = "6A51B888-FF44-4FEA-82E1-839401E9CD74"
$WfmUserName = Read-Host -Prompt 'Input your WFM user name'
$WfmPwd = Read-Host -Prompt 'Input your WFM password' -AsSecureString
$plainPwd =[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($WfmPwd))

$UpdatedInstance = Set-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance -ConnectorId $BlueYonderId -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId -ConnectorSpecificSettingAdminApiUrl $adminApiUrl -ConnectorSpecificSettingCookieAuthUrl $cookieAuthUrl -ConnectorSpecificSettingEssApiUrl $essApiUrl -ConnectorSpecificSettingFederatedAuthUrl $federatedAuthUrl -ConnectorSpecificSettingLoginPwd $plainPwd -ConnectorSpecificSettingLoginUserName $WfmUserName -ConnectorSpecificSettingRetailWebApiUrl $retailWebApiUrl -ConnectorSpecificSettingSiteManagerUrl $siteManagerUrl -DesignatedActorId $DesignatedActorId -EnabledConnectorScenario @() -EnabledWfiScenario @() -Name $UpdatedInstanceName -SyncFrequencyInMin 60 -IfMatch $Etag -ConnectorAdminEmail $ConnectorAdminEmail

if ($UpdatedInstance.Id -ne $null) {
    Write-Host "Success"
}
else {
    throw "Update instance failed"
}
```
