# Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

## Overview

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM). Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in Blue Yonder WFM from within Shifts.

You can use the [Shifts connector wizard](shifts-connector-wizard.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center or [PowerShell](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-powershell-setup.md) to set up a connection. After a connection is set up, you can manage it by using [Shifts connector PowerShell cmdlets](#shifts-connector-cmdlets).

This article describes how to use PowerShell to do the following:

- [Check connection setup status](#check-connection-setup-status)
- [View an error report for a connection](#view-an-error-report-for-a-connection)
- [Resolve connection errors](#resolve-connection-errors)
- [Change connection settings](#change-connection-settings)
- [Unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection](#unmap-a-team-from-one-connection-and-map-it-to-another-connection)
- [Disable sync for a connection](#disable-sync-for-a-connection)

This article assumes that you've already set up a connection to Blue Yonder WFM, either by using the wizard or PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also manage your connection in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For example, you can check the health status and access the wizard to change connection settings. To learn more, see [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-admin-center-manage.md).

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-admin-role](includes/shifts-connector-admin-role.md)]

## Set up your environment

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you follow these steps to set up your environment before running any of the commands or scripts in this article.

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-set-up-environment](includes/shifts-connector-set-up-environment.md)]

7. Connect to Teams.

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams
    ```

    When you're prompted, sign in using your admin credentials. You're now set up to run the scripts in this article and Shifts connector cmdlets.

## Check connection setup status

## View an error report for a connection
<a name="error_report"> </a>

## Resolve connection errors

### User mapping errors

User mapping errors may occur if one or more users in a WFM instance isn't a member of the mapped team in Teams. To resolve this issue, make sure that the users in the mapped team match the users in the WFM instance.

To view details of unmapped users, [set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell
#View sync errors script
Write-Host "View sync errors"
Start-Sleep 1

#Ensure Teams module is of version x
Write-Host "Checking Teams module version"
try {
    Get-InstalledModule -Name "MicrosoftTeams" -MinimumVersion 4.7.0
} catch {
    throw
}

#List connection instances available
Write-Host "Listing connection instances"
$InstanceList = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance
write $InstanceList

#Get an instance
if ($InstanceList.Count -gt 0){
    $InstanceId = Read-Host -Prompt 'Input the instance ID that you want to retrieve user sync results from'
}
else {
    throw "Instance list is empty"
}

#Get a list of the mappings
Write-Host "Listing team mappings"
$mappings = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId
write $mappings

#For each mapping, retrieve the failed mappings
ForEach ($mapping in $mappings){
    $teamsTeamId = $mapping.TeamId
    $wfmTeamId = $mapping.WfmTeamId
    Write-Host "Failed mapped users in the mapping of ${teamsTeamId} and ${wfmTeamId}:"
    $userSyncResult = Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionSyncResult -ConnectorInstanceId $InstanceId -TeamId $teamsTeamId
    Write-Host "Failed AAD users:"
    write $userSyncResult.FailedAadUser
    Write-Host "Failed WFM users:"
    write $userSyncResult.FailedWfmUser
}
```

### Account authorization errors

## Change connection settings
<a name="change_settings"> </a>

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-change-connection-settings](includes/shifts-connector-change-connection-settings.md)]

[Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell
#Update connector instance and mapping script
Write-Host "Update Connector instance and mapping"
Start-Sleep 1

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-disable-shifts-requests](includes/shifts-connector-disable-shifts-requests.md)]

## Unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-unmap-a-team](includes/shifts-connector-unmap-a-team.md)]

## Disable sync for a connection

Use this script to disable sync for a connection. Keep in mind this script doesn't remove or delete a connection. It turns off sync so that no data is synced between Shifts and your WFM system for the connection that you specify.

[Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already), and then run the following script.

```powershell
#Disable sync script
Write-Host "Disable sync"
Start-Sleep 1

#Ensure Teams module is at least version x
Write-Host "Checking Teams module version"

    Get-InstalledModule -Name "MicrosoftTeams" -MinimumVersion 4.7.0

|Unable to authenticate Graph. |Authentication failed.
