# Microsoft Teams EHR connector Virtual Appointments report

The Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector Virtual Appointments report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you a quick and easy way to view Teams EHR-integrated virtual appointments usage in your organization.

To view the report, you must be a Teams admin, Global reader, Report reader, or Global admin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use a less-privileged role.

## View the report

There are two ways to access and view the report in the Teams admin center.

- Through the [EHR connector Virtual Appointments card](#the-ehr-connector-virtual-appointments-card) in the dashboard
- Directly by choosing [**EHR connector Virtual Appointments**](#the-teams-ehr-connector-virtual-appointments-report) in **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**

### The EHR connector Virtual Appointments card

In the dashboard of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to the **EHR connector Virtual Appointments** card.

Here, you get an at-a-glance view of Teams EHR-integrated virtual appointment activity by month, including completed appointments, remaining allocation, and whether you exceeded the monthly limit (depending on the license you have).
