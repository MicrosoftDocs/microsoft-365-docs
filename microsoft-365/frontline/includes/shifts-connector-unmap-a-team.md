If you want to unmap a team from one connection and map it to another connection:

1. [Set up your environment](#set-up-your-environment) (if you haven't already).
1. View a list of all team mappings for a connection.

    ```powershell
    Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId>
    ```

1. Remove a team mapping from the connection.

    ```powershell
    Remove-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId> -TeamId <TeamId>
    ```

1. Map the team to another connection.

    ```powershell
    New-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionTeamMap -ConnectorInstanceId <ConnectorInstanceId> -TeamId <TeamId> -WfmTeamId <SiteId> -TimeZone <TimeZone>
    ```
