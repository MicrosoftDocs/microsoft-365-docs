The Shifts connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with your workforce management (WFM) system. Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in your WFM system from within Shifts.

The wizard creates a connection to your WFM system and a connection instance, which apply the sync settings and team mappings that you choose. Sync settings determine the schedule information and what entities sync between your WFM system and Shifts. Team mappings define the sync relationship between your WFM instances and teams in Teams.

You can create one or more connection instances, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a  connection instance with unique sync settings for each location. Keep in mind that a WFM instance should only be mapped once to a Microsoft team at any given time. However, it's possible in the wizard to have different connection instances with the same mappings. This means that you can create connection instances with duplicated mappings.

With your WFM system as the system of record, your frontline workers can efficiently manage their schedules and availability in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use your WFM system to set up schedules.
