Account authorization errors may occur if the WFM service account or Microsoft 365 system account credentials are incorrect or don't have the required permissions.

To change your WFM service account or Microsoft 365 system account credentials for the connection, you can run the [Set-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance) cmdlet or use the PowerShell script in the [Change connection settings](#change-connection-settings) section of this article.
