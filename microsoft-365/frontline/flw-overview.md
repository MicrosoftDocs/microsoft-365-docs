# Get started with Microsoft 365 for frontline workers

## What is Microsoft 365 for frontline workers?

Frontline workers are employees whose primary function is to work directly with customers or the general public providing services, support, and selling products, or employees directly involved in the manufacturing and distribution of products and services. Microsoft 365 for frontline workers helps support employee experiences in the following areas so that your frontline workers can do their best work and help your customers:

- [Enhance communications and collaboration](#enhance-communications-and-collaboration)
- [Transform employee experiences](#transform-employee-experiences)
- [Increase frontline operational efficiency](#increase-frontline-operational-efficiency)
- Helps [safeguard your business](#safeguard-your-business) with security and compliance offerings, including providing support for modern devices

The following image shows the employee experiences that are key to frontline workers, and common areas where Microsoft 365 can improve experiences for frontline workers:

### Licensing for your frontline workers

[Microsoft 365 for frontline workers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline) is optimized for a mobile workforce that primarily interacts with customers, but also needs to stay connected to the rest of your organization.

Microsoft 365 for frontline workers refers to the Microsoft 365 F3 and F1 licenses, but you can also use an Enterprise license (E3, E5) to implement any of the frontline scenarios. Learn more about [licensing options for frontline workers](flw-licensing-options.md) and which license types you should use for different types of users in your organization.

Some features are available for F3 licenses, but not F1, such as Power Apps and Power Automate. For a detailed comparison of what's included in Microsoft 365  plans for enterprises, see the [Modern work plan comparison](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2139145) table.

## Enhance communications and collaboration

## Adoption principles to help envision and implement business scenarios

You can implement many helpful scenarios for frontline workers quickly, using out-of-the-box capabilities. For a list of scenarios we recommend and provide guidance for, see [Choose your scenarios](flw-choose-scenarios.md).

However, it also pays to spend time thinking through exactly what you want to achieve organizationally and setting the appropriate groundwork. Particularly if you need to enhance out-of-the-box scenarios with integrated or custom solutions from solution providers or partners, you want to spend time planning and envisioning before you dive in.

The following principles are based on information from the [Frontline Solutions Success Kit](https://aka.ms/TeamsFLWSuccessKit). Find more adoption resources on the [frontline worker section of the Microsoft Adoption site](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/frontline-workers/).
