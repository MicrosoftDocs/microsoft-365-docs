# Use the Shifts connector wizard to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Preview)

## Overview

The Shifts connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with your workforce management (WFM) system. Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in your WFM system from within Shifts.

The wizard creates a connection to your Blue Yonder WFM system and a connection instance. This applies the sync settings and team mappings you choose. Sync settings determine the schedule information and what entities sync between Blue Yonder and Shifts. Team mappings define the sync relationship between your Blue Yonder instances and teams in Microsoft Teams.

You can create one or more connection instances, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a connection instance with unique sync settings for each location. A Blue Yonder instance should only be mapped once to a Microsoft team at any given time. However, it's possible in the wizard to have different connection instances with the same mappings. This means that you can create connection instances with duplicated mappings.

With Blue Yonder, your frontline workers can efficiently manage their schedules and availability in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use Blue Yonder to set up schedules.

## Integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder Workforce Management

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) enables you to integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM) to manage your schedules and keep them up to date. In this article, we walk you through how to run the wizard to set up a connection and connection instance to Blue Yonder WFM through the connector.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer, you can use PowerShell to integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder WFM. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-powershell-setup.md).

### Prerequisites

Before you try the Shifts connector wizard, check that you meet all these prerequisites:

-	Make sure you’re a Microsoft 365 global admin.

-	Make sure you have Blue Yonder WFM version 2020.3, 2021.1, or 2021.2.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Blue Yonder WFM 2020.3 or 2021.1, apply the 2020.3.0.4 or 2021.1.0.3 patch. This patch fixes an issue where users get a persistent error message in Shifts. It also fixes an issue that prevents users from updating their availability in Shifts.

-	Know your Blue Yonder WFM Service account name, password and service URLs:
    - Federated authentication URL
    - Cookie authentication URL
    - Employee self-service URL
    - Retail web API URL
    - Site manager API URL
    - Administration API URL

    If you don't have all this information, contact Blue Yonder support. A Blue Yonder account is created at the root enterprise level by a Blue Yonder enterprise administrator. It must have API Access, Client Admin, Store Manager, and Worker access. The account and password are required to create a connection.


-   Make sure federated SSO authentication is enabled in your Blue Yonder WFM environment. Contact Blue Yonder support to make sure federated SSO is enabled. They'll need the following information:
    - federatedSSOValidationService: https://wfmconnector.teams.microsoft.com/api/v1/fedauth/{tenantId}/6A51B888-FF44-4FEA-82E1-839401E9CD74/authorize where {tenantId} is your tenantId
    - proxyHeader: X-MS-AuthToken

-	Make sure you have at least one team set up in Microsoft Teams.

-	Make sure you’ve added a Microsoft 365 system account (not your personal user account) as team owner to all teams you want to map.

    You can [create this account in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) and assign it a Microsoft 365 license. Then, add the account as a team owner to all teams that you want to map. The Shifts connector uses this account when syncing Shifts changes from Blue Yonder. We recommend you create an account specifically for this purpose and not use your personal user account.

-  Make sure the teams you want to map don't have any schedules in Shifts or Blue Yonder. If a team has an existing schedule, follow the steps below to [remove schedule entities from the team](#remove-schedule-entities-from-teams-you-want-to-map) before you map a UKG Dimensions instance to it. Otherwise, you'll see duplicate shifts.

## Remove schedule entities from teams you want to map
<a name="remove_schedules"> </a>

> [!NOTE]
> Complete this step if you're mapping Blue Yonder WFM instances to existing teams that have schedule entities. If you're mapping to teams that don't have any schedules or if you're creating new teams to map to, you can skip this step.

Use PowerShell to remove schedule entities from teams.

1. First, you'll need to install the PowerShell modules and get set up. Follow the steps to [set up your environment](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md#set-up-your-environment)
1. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord -TeamId <Teams team ID> -DateRangeStartDate <start time> -DateRangeEndDate <end time> -ClearSchedulingGroup:$false -EntityType <the scenario entities that you want to remove, the format is @(scenario1, scenario2, ...)> -DesignatedActorId <Teams team owner ID>
    ```

    To get a list of scenarios for the `EntityType` parameter, run [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector). Schedule data will be removed for the date and time range that you specify.

To learn more, see [Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord](/powershell/module/teams/remove-csteamsshiftsschedulerecord).

#### Choose settings
<a name="sync"> </a>

On the Settings page, you choose the information to sync from Blue Yonder WFM to Shifts, the sync frequency, and whether Shifts users can make changes to the data.
    :::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-sync-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sync settings page of the wizard, showing sync settings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-sync-settings.png":::

1. Enter a name for your connection instance. It can't be longer than 100 characters or have any special characters.

1. Enter your Microsoft 365 system account. This is the [account that you created as a prerequisite](#prerequisites) that is a team owner of all the teams you want to map.

<a name="email"> </a>

3. Under **Email notification recipients**, choose who receives email notifications about this connection instance. You can add individual users and groups. The email notifications contain information about setup status and any issues or errors that may occur after the connection instance is set up.

  > [!TIP]
  > You'll be given the following options for the next group of settings: <br>
  > **Shifts users will not see provider data**: Data won't sync between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. <br>
  > **Shifts users can see provider data**: Data syncing is unidirectional from Blue Yonder WFM to Shifts. <br>
  > **Shifts users can see and change provider data**: Data syncing is bidirectional between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts.

4. Choose your basic, **Time card**, and **Request** settings from the options listed above.

5. Then, choose your sync frequency.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you disable a feature by selecting the option **Shifts users will not see provider data**, be aware that:
    >
    > - If the setting **Schedules, groups, shifts, and activities** is disabled, then all other settings, such as **Time off** and **Employee availability**, and more, will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Open shift** is disabled, **Open shift request** will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Time off** is disabled, **Time off request** will also be disabled.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
    >
    > - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    >
    > After you run the wizard, make sure you follow the steps in the [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests](#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests) section later in this article.

6. When you're done choosing your settings, select **Next**.

#### Map Blue Yonder Workforce Management instances to teams
<a name="sites"> </a>

Choose the Blue Yonder WFM instances that you want to connect to Shifts, and then map each WFM instance to a team in Teams. You can map up to 400 instances.

##### Manually map instances to teams

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of wizard, showing the list of Blue Yonder WFM instances." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-map.png":::
<a name="mapping"> </a>
<a name="search_teams"> </a>
Then, map each instance to a team in Teams. You can map an instance to an existing team or you can create a new team.

1. On the **Mapping** page, start by choosing which WFM instance(s) you want to map to Microsoft Teams team(s).

1. Tick the checkbox for each WFM instance you want to map. Instances will only map if you check their boxes.

1. Next, search for and choose the correct Microsoft Teams team.
    Keep in mind that teams that are already mapped to a WFM instance in this connection instance won't be available to map again.

1. Choose the time zone. The closest city will be automatically filled in, but you can change it.

1. When you've mapped all your teams, select **Next**.

##### Use a CSV file to map instances to teams

1. On the **Mapping** page, choose **CSV upload tool**.

2. Select **Download template** to get the CSV mapping file. The template will include a list of all your Blue Yonder WFM instances and their IDs. The top rows of your template will look like this:

|Blue Yonder WFM Instance ID |Blue Yonder WFM Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
|------|------|------|------|------|
|Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Blank |Blank |Default*|

And the bottom rows of your template will look like this:

|Blue Yonder WFM Instance ID |Blue Yonder WFM Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
|------|------|------|------|------|
|Blank |Blank |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Default*|

3. Choose a team that you want to map to a Blue Yonder WFM instance. Cut and paste the Team ID and Team Name from the bottom half of your template to be in line with the desired Blue Yonder WFM instance. A completed row of your template should look like this:

|Blue Yonder WFM Instance ID |Blue Yonder WFM Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
|------|------|------|------|------|
|Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Team ID that you moved |Team Name that you moved |Default*|

Repeat this for all your desired mappings.

4. Enter the correct location in the Time Zone column if needed.

>[!NOTE]
>The wizard supports approximately 460 locations. The Time Zone needs to be according to the tz format. If the specific location you chose isn't supported, you'll be shown an error in the wizard. Try using the closest city or major city within the same time zone.

5. On the **Mapping** page, select **Browse** to find and upload your completed CSV file.

6. Choose **Done** if your file has uploaded correctly. Otherwise, review the provided error report and upload a corrected file.

7. Your new mappings will appear on the **Mappings** page.

8. Choose **Next**.

### Review and finish

Before finishing, review the summary of the connection instance creation process. If you need to make changes during the connection instance creation process, choose **Back**. When you're ready, select **Finish**.

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review page of the wizard, showing mappings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png":::

The wizard starts the process to set up the connection instance, which may take some time to complete. If you try to edit the connection instance before the setup is complete, you most likely won't be able to view the mappings you created previously.

The email notification recipients you chose will receive email notifications about setup status in case there are any errors.

Select **Done** to exit the wizard.

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow these steps only if you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, or time off requests in the wizard. Completing this step hides the capability in Shifts.
>
> - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see Blue Yonder WFM data**
> - Swap requests: **Feature is disabled for all users**
> - Time off requests: **Feature is disabled for all users**
>
> Without this second step, users will still see the capability in Shifts, and will get an "unsupported operation" error message if they try to use it.

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use the Graph API [schedule resource type](/graph/api/resources/schedule) to set the following parameters to ```false``` for each team that you mapped to a Blue Yonder WFM instance:

- Open shifts: ```openShiftsEnabled```
- Swap requests:  ```swapShiftsRequestsEnabled```
- Time off requests: ```timeOffRequestsEnabled```

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to **Settings** in Shifts, and then turn off the **Open shifts** setting.

## Manage your connection and connection instance
<a name="update_connection"> </a>

After a connection is set up, you can manage and make changes to it in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by using PowerShell.

### Use the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Connector Management Console page lists each connection and connection instance that you've set up, along with information such as health status and sync interval details. You can also access the wizard to create new connections and connection instances and make changes to any of your existing ones. For example, you can update sync settings and team mappings.

To learn more, see [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-admin-center-manage.md).

### Use PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to view an error report, change connection settings, disable sync, and more. For step-by-step guidance, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md).
