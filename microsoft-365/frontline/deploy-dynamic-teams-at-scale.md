# Deploy frontline dynamic teams at scale

## Overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature will begin rolling out for public preview in July 2023. If you would like to provide feedback and improve this feature while in preview, please fill out [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/DWaJXA6Dax).

Frontline teams are a collection of people, content, and tools within an organization for different frontline worker locations. Membership of frontline dynamic teams is determined and managed by a set of Microsoft Entra attributes. [Learn more about Microsoft Entra attributes](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/how-to-define-custom-attributes).

In the setup process, you define the following information with Microsoft Entra attributes:

- Who your frontline workers are
- What locations they work at

You also determine team structure and team owners.

Then, you can choose which locations you want to create dynamic frontline teams for.

Team membership is automatically managed over time through the power of dynamic teams. As frontline workers are onboarded, offboarded, or change locations, their membership in these teams are updated accordingly.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The admin running the deployment process must be a Global admin.

- Users must have a Microsoft 365 F3, F1, E3, or E5 license. If a user doesn't have one of these licenses, they'll need a Microsoft Entra ID P1 add-on license to use dynamic teams. [Learn more about frontline licensing](flw-licensing-options.md).
- Ensure you can define your frontline workers and their work locations through data available in Microsoft Entra ID. If you don't have this data in Microsoft Entra ID, you can sync it through a [human capital management (HCM) connector](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision) or [use the PowerShell solution](deploy-teams-at-scale.md) to create static teams at scale.

When evaluating the right solution for your organization, we recommend you do the following:

  1. Plan your frontline deployment.
  1. Test the deploy tools&mdash;dynamic team creation (the process described in this article) or static team creation (using the [PowerShell solution](deploy-teams-at-scale.md)). Keep in mind that static teams aren't managed automatically.
  1. Deploy to a pilot location.
  1. Deploy to a broader set of locations using a phased approach.

## Set up your frontline dynamic teams

1. In the left navigation of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), choose **Teams** > **Manage frontline teams**.
2. In the table, choose **Setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-manage-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the manage frontline teams table in the Teams admin center." lightbox="media/dtas-manage-setup.png":::

3. Review the prerequisites information.

4. Select the Microsoft Entra attribute that defines your frontline workers. You can only choose one Microsoft Entra attribute, but you can define multiple values by separating them with commas.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-frontline-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to enter your Microsoft Entra attribute and values for frontline workers." lightbox="media/dtas-frontline-attribute.png":::

5. Select the Microsoft Entra attribute that defines the location your frontline employees work in. You can only choose one location attribute.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-location-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to enter your Microsoft Entra attribute for frontline locations." lightbox="media/dtas-location-attribute.png":::

6. Define your team structure by choosing a prefix. The prefix is applied using the "prefix-location" format for all your teams.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-prefix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the prefix, team template, and team owner account fields." lightbox="media/dtas-prefix.png":::

7. Optionally, choose a team template. The team template you choose defines the channel structure for all your frontline teams. [Learn more about team templates](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Currently, only team templates that are set to the English (United States) locale are supported. Keep in mind that the locale doesn't affect translation of the template or data residency. The locale setting is used only to distinguish between templates that have the same name that are created in different languages.

8. Enter a user account object ID to be the team owner. This account will be the owner for all frontline teams. It's recommended to choose a shared account rather than an individual person.
    1. To get a user's object ID, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
    1. Select **Users**, and then choose your user.
    1. Copy the user's object ID.

9. Review the settings, and then choose **Finish setup.**

    >[!NOTE]
    >Setup can take several hours to run. You can refresh the **Manage frontline teams** page to get the latest status of your setup.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-setup-submitted.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage frontline teams page with a banner showing that setup was submitted." lightbox="media/dtas-setup-submitted.png":::

## Deploy your frontline dynamic teams

1. After setup is completed, go to the **Manage frontline teams** page, and then select the **Deploy** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-deploy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deploy button." lightbox="media/dtas-deploy.png":::

2. From here, you can review your settings and view the list of locations that don't yet have a frontline dynamic team created.

3. In the table, select the locations that you want to create teams for.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-deploy-locations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the table of locations." lightbox="media/dtas-deploy-locations.png":::

4. Select **Deploy**. This process can take several hours depending on how many teams you're creating. After deployment is completed, you'll see the number updated in the **Frontline teams** tile. On this tile, you can download a CSV file with a list of your frontline teams. If any errors occurred, you can download the error CSV file on the **Last deployment health** tile.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-view-errors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where you can get the CSV file on the Manage frontline teams page." lightbox="media/dtas-view-errors.png":::

5. You can repeat this process for any frontline locations that don't have a team.

## Managing your frontline dynamic teams

You can manage your teams when changes happen in your organization.

### Create new teams for newly opened locations

1. In the left navigation of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), choose **Teams** > **Manage frontline teams**.

2. In the table, choose **Deploy**.

3. Select the **Refresh location** button, and proceed when prompted by the dialog box. This process can take several hours depending on your number of new locations.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dtas-refresh-locations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Refresh location button." lightbox="media/dtas-refresh-locations.png":::

4. After the refresh is completed, your setup status shows as **Complete**. You can proceed to [deploy your new teams](#deploy-your-frontline-dynamic-teams). Deployment can take several hours depending on how many new teams you're deploying.

### Edit your frontline team settings

## Get analytics on frontline teams usage

The [Teams usage report](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft-teams-usage-activity) in  Teams admin center gives you an overview of usage activity in Teams. You can use the report to view usage details for your frontline teams, including active users, active channels, total organized meetings, last activity date, and other information.

1. In the left navigation of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), **choose Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**.
2. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams usage**.
3. Under **Date range**, select a date range of 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. Then, choose **Run report**.
4. In the upper-right corner, select **Export to Excel** > **Export table as CSV**.
5. Filter the spreadsheet based on your frontline team IDs. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > To get a list of your frontline team IDs, in the Teams admin center, go to **Teams** > **Manage frontline teams**, and then in the **Frontline teams** section, select **Download CSV**.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are channels missing when I create my teams?

It can take time for channels to propagate in Teams. The General channel is created first and the remaining channels are added over time. All channels should be available within 24 hours of team creation.

### How do I delete a frontline team?

You can delete a team by using the [Teams client](https://support.microsoft.com/office/delete-a-team-in-microsoft-teams-c386f91b-f7e6-400b-aac7-8025f74f8b41), [Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/archive-or-delete-a-team), [PowerShell](/powershell/module/teams/remove-team), or [Graph](/graph/api/group-delete).

Keep in mind that it can take up to 24 hours for a team and the Microsoft 365 group that's associated with the team to be fully deleted.

If you need to redeploy a frontline location team that was deleted, follow these steps:

1. [Refresh locations](#managing-your-frontline-dynamic-teams).
1. After the refresh is completed, choose the location you want to deploy.
1. Select **Deploy**.
