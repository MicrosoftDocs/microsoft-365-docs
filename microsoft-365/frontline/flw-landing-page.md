# Get started with Teams for frontline workers

Frontline workers are employees whose primary function is to work directly with customers or the general public providing services, support, and selling products, or employees directly involved in the manufacturing and distribution of products and services.

[Microsoft 365 for frontline workers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline) is optimized for a mobile workforce that primarily interacts with customers, but also needs to stay connected to the rest of your organization. Learn more about [licensing options for frontline workers](flw-licensing-options.md) and which license types you should use for different types of users in your organization.
