# Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

## Overview

Use the [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM). After a connection is set up, your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in Blue Yonder WFM from within Shifts.

In this article, we walk you through how to use PowerShell to set up and configure the connector to integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder WFM.

To set up the connection, you run a PowerShell script. The script configures the connector, applies sync settings, creates the connection, and maps Blue Yonder WFM sites to teams. Sync settings determine the features enabled in Shifts and the schedule information that's synced between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. Mappings define the sync relationship between your Blue Yonder WFM sites and teams in Teams. You can map to existing teams and new teams.

We provide two scripts. You can use either script, depending on whether you want to map to existing teams or create new teams to map to.

You can set up multiple connections, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a connection with unique sync settings for each location. Keep in mind that a Blue Yonder WFM site can only be mapped to one team at any given time. If a site is already mapped to a team, it can't be mapped to another team.

With Blue Yonder WFM as the system of record, your frontline workers can see and swap shifts, manage their availability, and request time off in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use Blue Yonder WFM to set up schedules.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the [Shifts connector wizard](shifts-connector-wizard.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder WFM.

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-prerequisites](../../includes/shifts-connector-prerequisites.md)]

### Admin role to manage the connector using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-admin-role](../../includes/shifts-connector-admin-role.md)]

## Set up your environment

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-set-up-environment](../../includes/shifts-connector-set-up-environment.md)]

## Connect to Teams

Run the following to connect to Teams.

```powershell
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

When you're prompted, sign in using your admin credentials. You're now set up to run the scripts in this article and Shifts connector cmdlets.

## Identify the teams you want to map

> [!NOTE]
> Complete this step if you're mapping Blue Yonder WFM sites to existing teams. If you're creating new teams to map to, you can skip this step.

In the Azure portal, go to the [All groups](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GroupsManagementMenuBlade/AllGroups) page to get a list of the TeamIds of teams in your organization.

Take note of the TeamIds of the teams you want to map. The script will prompt you to enter this information.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more teams have an existing schedule, the script will remove the schedules from those teams. Otherwise, you'll see duplicate shifts.

## Run the script

Run the script:

- To set up a connection and create new teams to map, [run this script](#set-up-a-connection-and-create-new-teams-to-map).
- To set up a connection and map to existing teams, [run this script](#set-up-a-connection-and-map-to-existing-teams).

The script does the following actions. You'll be prompted to enter setup and configuration details.

1. Tests and verifies the connection to Blue Yonder WFM using the Blue Yonder WFM service account credentials and service URLs that you enter.
1. Configures the Shifts connector.
1. Applies sync settings. These settings include the sync frequency (in minutes) and the schedule data that's synced between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. Schedule data is defined in the following parameters:

    - The **enabledConnectorScenarios** parameter defines data that's synced from Blue Yonder WFM to Shifts. Options are `Shift`, `SwapRequest`, `UserShiftPreferences`, `OpenShift`, `OpenShiftRequest`, `TimeOff`, `TimeOffRequest`.
    - The **enabledWfiScenarios** parameter defines data that's synced from Shifts to Blue Yonder WFM. Options are `SwapRequest`, `OpenShiftRequest`, `TimeOffRequest`, `UserShiftPreferences`.

    To learn more, see [New-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance). To see the list of supported sync options for each parameter, run [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The script enables sync for all these options. If you want to change sync settings, you can do so after the connection is set up. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md).

1. Creates the connection.
1. Maps Blue Yonder WFM sites to teams. Mappings are based on the Blue Yonder WFM site IDs and TeamIds that you enter or new teams you create, depending on the script that you run. If a team has an existing schedule, the script removes schedule data for the date and time range that you specify.

A Success message on the screen indicates that your connection is successfully set up.

## If you need to make changes to a connection

To make changes to a connection after it's set up, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md). For example, you can update sync settings, team mappings, and disable sync for a connection.
