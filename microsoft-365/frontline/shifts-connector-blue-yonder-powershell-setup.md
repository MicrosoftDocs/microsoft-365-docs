# Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

## Overview

Use the [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM). Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in Blue Yonder WFM from within Shifts.

In this article, we walk you through how to use PowerShell to set up and configure the connector to integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder WFM.

To set up the connection, you run a PowerShell script. The script configures the connector, applies sync settings, creates the connection, and maps Blue Yonder WFM instances to teams. Sync settings determine the features enabled in Shifts and the schedule information that's synced between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. Mappings define the sync relationship between your Blue Yonder WFM instances and teams in Teams. You can map to existing teams and new teams.

We provide two scripts. You can use either script, depending on whether you want to map to existing teams or create new teams to map to.

You can set up multiple connections, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a connection with unique sync settings for each location. Keep in mind that a Blue Yonder WFM instance can only be mapped to one team at any given time. If an instance is already mapped to a team, it can't be mapped to another team.

With Blue Yonder WFM as the system of record, your frontline workers can efficiently manage their schedules and availability in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use Blue Yonder WFM to set up schedules.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the [Shifts connector wizard](shifts-connector-wizard.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder WFM.

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-prerequisites](includes/shifts-connector-prerequisites.md)]

### Admin role to manage the connector using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-admin-role](includes/shifts-connector-admin-role.md)]

## Set up your environment

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-set-up-environment](includes/shifts-connector-set-up-environment.md)]

## Connect to Teams

Run the following to connect to Teams.

```powershell
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

When you're prompted, sign in using your admin credentials. You're now set up to run the scripts in this article and Shifts connector cmdlets.

## Identify the teams you want to map

> [!NOTE]
> Complete this step if you're mapping Blue Yonder WFM instances to existing teams. If you're creating new teams to map to, you can skip this step.

In the Azure portal, go to the [All groups](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GroupsManagementMenuBlade/AllGroups) page to get a list of the TeamIds of teams in your organization.

Take note of the TeamIds of the teams you want to map. The script will prompt you to enter this information.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more teams have an existing schedule, the script will remove the schedules from those teams. Otherwise, you'll see duplicate shifts.

## Run the script

Run one of these two scripts, depending on whether you're creating a new team or mapping to an existing team:

- To set up a connection while creating a new team within Microsoft Teams and mapping a Blue Yonder team to the new team, run the [new teams script](#set-up-a-connection-and-create-a-new-team).
- To set up a connection and map to an existing team within Microsoft Teams, run the [existing teams script](#set-up-a-connection-and-map-an-existing-team).

Follow the on-screen instructions when you run the script. The script will complete these actions:

1. Test and verify the connection to Blue Yonder WFM using the Blue Yonder WFM service account credentials and service URLs that you enter.
1. Apply sync settings. These settings include the sync frequency (in minutes) and the schedule data synced between Blue Yonder WFM and Shifts. You can enable schedule data defined by these scenarios: `Shift`, `SwapRequest`, `UserShiftPreferences`, `OpenShift`, `OpenShiftRequest`, `TimeOff`, `TimeOffRequest`.

    To learn more, see [New-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance). To see the list of supported sync options for each parameter, run [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The script you select will enable sync for each supported sync option. If you want to change sync settings, you can do so after the connection is set up. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md).

1. Map Blue Yonder WFM instances to your teams within Microsoft Teams.
    - If you select the new teams script to create new teams, mappings are based on the new teams you create.
    - If you select the existing teams script to map existing teams, mappings are based on Blue Yonder instance IDs and TeamIds that you enter. If a team has an existing schedule, the script removes all schedule data.

After you run the script, a **Success** message confirms if your connection is successfully set up.

## Manage your connection

After a connection is set up, you can manage and make changes to it in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by using PowerShell.

### Use the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Connector Management page lists each connection that you've set up, along with information such as health status and sync interval details. You can also access the wizard to make changes to any of your connections. For example, you can update sync settings and team mappings.

To learn more, see [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-admin-center-manage.md).

### Use PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to view an error report, change connection settings, disable sync, and more. For step-by-step guidance, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md).
