> [!NOTE]
> These scenarios are also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Retail. You can do more with these scenarios when you also use other capabilities from the Microsoft Cloud for Retail, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 at [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](/industry/retail).

## Day-to-day communications and collaboration in Teams

Microsoft Teams enables in-store sales associates, managers, and other staff to collaborate efficiently with included collaboration features and apps. Your frontline workforce can use Teams on either personal or shared devices depending on the needs of your organization.

Teams includes the following ways to communicate and share information:

| Task | Description | Manage this capability | End-user training |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Chat, post messages, and communicate | Your in-store associates can seamlessly communicate across departments to fulfill orders, get help for customers, and manage stock needs. <br><br>Teams provides a great out-of-the-box collaboration experience for your organization, and most organizations find that the default settings work for them. | [Chat, teams, channels, & apps in Microsoft Teams](../deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) | [Start chats](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-and-pin-chats-a864b052-5e4b-4ccf-b046-2e26f40e21b5) and [Work with posts and messages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-format-a-post-e66777da-636b-49eb-9408-b0d88b212885) |
|Call and meet with team members | Managers can set up individual meetings, or use channel meetings to manage daily meetings, both with the power of Teams audio, video, screen sharing, recording, and transcription features. For example, a manager could set up a morning video meeting with store associates in different departments to check their status before opening the store. <br><br>You'll need to configure settings for meetings and conferencing, and enable a Voice solution to use calling. | [Meetings and conferencing in Microsoft Teams](../deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) and [Plan your Teams Voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md) | [Make calls](https://support.microsoft.com/office/overview-of-teams-calls-425d6970-6e27-47b6-bc61-4c38fff51c4f) and [Join a meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4) |
|Store and share files and documents | Sharing files allows in-store staff to easily access information such as merchandising diagrams without having to leave the sales floor or get help from a manager. Every team automatically comes with a Files tab that you can use to store and share documents. This tab actually represents a folder within the default team site document library in SharePoint that is automatically created when the team is created. | [How SharePoint and OneDrive interact with Microsoft Teams](../sharepoint-onedrive-interact.md) | [Upload and share files](https://support.microsoft.com/office/upload-and-share-files-57b669db-678e-424e-b0a0-15d19215cb12) |

Your team can use apps in Teams to coordinate and collaborate with each other on everyday tasks, such as the following:

![Infographic showing the different functions available in Teams and as Teams apps as described in the list below.](../media/retail-teams-collaborate.png)

| Task | App | Description | Manage this app | End-user training |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Create, manage, and share schedules| Shifts | Use Shifts to seamlessly manage and share schedules. Managers can create custom groups such as cashiers or greeters, assign shifts to employees, add custom labeling and breaks, and add open shifts that employees can request to take. Employees can use Shifts to set their availability, view their schedules, swap shifts with coworkers, and clock in and out. | [Manage Shifts](/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/shifts/manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams)|[Shifts video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-shifts-f8efe6e4-ddb3-4d23-b81b-bb812296b821)|
| Keep in touch | Walkie Talkie | The Walkie Talkie app provides instant push-to-talk communication. By using Walkie Talkie, employees and managers can communicate from anywhere in the store. For example, if a customer on one side of the store asks an employee if an item is in stock on the other side of the store, the employee can use Walkie Talkie to contact someone who works near the item. Because Walkie Talkie doesn’t have limited range, employees can also easily consult with experts in other stores or corporate offices. | [Manage Walkie Talkie](../walkie-talkie.md)  | [Walkie Talkie video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-walkie-talkie-in-teams-884a008a-761e-4b62-99f8-15671d9a2f69) |
| Boost morale | Praise | The Praise app allows management and in-store associates to congratulate each other and share appreciation by sending badges. Praise helps employees feel recognized for achievements such as making sales goals and going above and beyond to help customers. | [Manage the Praise app](../manage-praise-app.md) |[Praise video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/communication-and-praise-7d37ef80-542b-42e5-aa01-0fabbaa634b6) |
| Track and monitor tasks | Tasks | Use Tasks in Teams to track to-do items for your whole retail team. Store managers and employees can create, assign, and schedule tasks, categorize tasks, and update status at any time from any device running Teams. IT pros and admins can also publish tasks to specific teams for your organization. For example, you could publish a set of tasks for daily cleaning or steps to set up a new display.| [Manage the Tasks app](/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app) |[Tasks video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-tasks-app-in-teams-e32639f3-2e07-4b62-9a8c-fd706c12c070) |
| Streamline approvals | Approvals | Use Approvals to streamline requests and processes with your team. Create, manage, and share approvals directly from your hub for teamwork. Start an approval flow from the same place you send a chat, in a channel conversation, or from the Approvals app itself. Just select an approval type, add details, attach files, and choose approvers. Once submitted, approvers are notified and can review and act on the request.<br>You can allow the Approvals app for your organization and add it to Teams. | [Teams Approvals app availability](/microsoftteams/approval-admin) | [Approvals video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-approvals-a9a01c95-e0bf-4d20-9ada-f7be3fc283d3?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams)|

### Set up your teams, channels, and apps

When you're ready to connect your retail associates in Teams, you can set up teams and channels for your store teams and managers with pre-built or custom templates. The easiest way is to start with a template. The **Organize a store** and **Retail for managers** [templates](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-retail-teams-templates) are pre-made templates that include channels and apps designed for retail. You can also create a template based off of an existing team. Even when you start with a template, you can customize the team and channels, and add more apps to suit your team's needs.

- Use channels with tabs to share news, keep employees in touch across shifts, and build community.
- Use teams templates to set up teams with similar structures (such as channels and tabs) across stores or regions.

#### Create a team based on a template

1. In Microsoft Teams, select **Join or create a team**.

2. Select **Create a team** and then scroll down to see available templates.

### Manage apps

Refine what's in your team with apps. You can allow or block apps for your organization, or configure settings for apps, in the Microsoft Teams admin center. For more information about managing apps, see [Manage apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](../manage-apps.md).

Your users can add any apps that you have allowed to their teams. Share this training with your users to show them how: [Find and use Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/office/find-and-use-apps-6e22a734-c002-4da0-ba63-681f155b142d).
