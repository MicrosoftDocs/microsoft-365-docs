# Shifts connectors

## Overview

Shifts connectors enable you to integrate Shifts, the schedule management tool in Microsoft Teams, with your workforce management (WFM) system. After you set up a connection, your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in your WFM system from within Shifts.

Connecting your WFM system to Teams empowers your frontline workforce to manage schedules more effectively and streamlines everyday processes for higher engagement and productivity. Your frontline workers have one place for their scheduling, communication, and collaboration needs to get work done, from anywhere, on any device.

This article gives you an overview of Shifts connectors and how they work.

## How Shifts connectors work

Connectors sync schedule data between your WFM system and Shifts, bringing your organizationâ€™s schedules into Teams. Shifts is where your frontline workers engage for their scheduling needs. Your WFM system is the system of record for business rules, compliance, and intelligence.

Data flows via the connector both ways to ensure schedules are always up to date. Schedules in your WFM system are synced to Shifts. And, changes made to schedules in Shifts are synced back to your WFM system. As the system of record, all business rules are enforced by your WFM system before data is saved to Shifts.

## Managed Shifts connectors

Managed Shifts connectors are connectors developed in collaboration with our partners. Managed connectors are hosted and managed either by us or our partners. With managed connectors, only minimal setup is needed.

### Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder

The Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder is a first-party offering that's hosted and managed by Microsoft. With this connector, you can integrate Shifts with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM) versions 2020.3, 2021.1, or 2021.2 to manage your schedules and keep them up to date.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Blue Yonder WFM version 2020.3 or 2021.1, apply the 2020.3.0.4 or 2021.1.0.3 patch. This patch fixes an issue where users get a persistent error message in Shifts. It also  fixes an issue that prevents users from updating their availability in Shifts.

When a frontline manager or worker tries to do any of these actions in Shifts, they'll receive a message to let them know the action isn't supported.

#### Example scenario

Eden, a manager, publishes a schedule in Blue Yonder WFM, which is synced to Shifts in Teams through the connector. Alex, a staff member, gets notified in Teams on his mobile device, and views his schedule and assigned shifts.

Alex needs to take some time off and requests a day off using Shifts. The request is sent to Blue Yonder WFM through the connector. Blue Yonder WFM ensures that the request is compliant with business rules and the request is created. Eden sees and approves the request in Blue Yonder WFM, and the approval is synced to Teams. (Eden can also see and approve the request in Shifts). Alex is notified in Teams that his request is approved and views his updated schedule.

Alex wants to swap a shift with a coworker. In Shifts, Alex sees a list of all shifts that are eligible for a swap based on business rules in Blue Yonder WFM. Alex chooses a shift that's currently assigned to Gena. Gena is notified in Teams on their mobile device and accepts the swap request. Eden sees and approves the request in Shifts, and the approval is synced to Blue Yonder WFM. (Eden can also see and approve the request in Blue Yonder WFM). Alex and Gena are notified in Teams, and view their updated schedules.

#### Set up a connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

Integrating Shifts with Blue Yonder WFM using the connector takes just a few steps. You can use the Shifts connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center to quickly set up a connection. The wizard configures the connector based on the settings you choose and creates the connection. If you prefer to use PowerShell, we also provide PowerShell scripts that you can use to get connected.

For step-by-step guidance, see:

- [Use the Shifts connector wizard to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-wizard.md)
- [Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-powershell-setup.md)

After a connection is set up, you can update and change connection settings at any time, as needed. To learn more, see:

- [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-admin-center-manage.md)
- [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md)

As for the connector itself, you don't need to worry about upgrades or maintenance. We take care of that.

#### Example scenario

Diego, a manager, publishes a schedule in Reflexis WFM, which is synced to Shifts in Teams through the connector. Hayden, a staff member, gets notified in Teams on their mobile device, and views their (and their teamâ€™s) new schedule. Hayden can also see detailed information, such as tasks set by the manager, within the assigned shifts.

Hayden wants to take a short vacation and requests a day off using Shifts. The request is sent to Reflexis WFM through the connector. Reflexis WFM ensures that the request is compliant with business rules and then creates the request. Diego sees and approves the request in Reflexis, and the approval is synced to Teams. (Diego can also see and approve the request in Shifts). Hayden is notified in Teams that the request has been approved and reviews their updated schedule.

In another example, Hayden wants to swap a shift with a coworker. In Shifts, Hayden sees a list of swap-eligible shifts based on business parameters set in Reflexis WFM. Hayden selects a shift that's currently assigned to Joanna. Joanna is notified in Teams on her phone and accepts the swap request in the app. Diego sees and approves the request in Shifts, and the approval is synced with Reflexis WFM. (Diego can also see and approve the request in Reflexis WFM). Hayden and Joanna are each notified in Teams and view their respective updated schedules.

#### Connection setup overview

Prerequisites for setting up a connection

- Reflexis WFM version 4.3.2 or later
- Microsoft Teams and the Shifts app
- All workers' data is in sync between Reflexis WFM and Teams

Here's an overview of the connection setup process.

1. Register a new app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which will be used to communicate with Shifts.â€‹
1. Take a note of the client ID and secret that's generated by registration.
1. Give permissions for Microsoft Graph API to the app that you registered.
1. Use the client ID and secret to configure the WFM app to connect with Teams through the connector.
1. Do a one-time sync to import basic data to map entities between Teams and Reflexis WFMâ€‹.
1. Sign in to Teams and go to the Shifts appâ€‹.

      Schedule data is synced from Reflexis WFM to Shifts when a schedule is published and workers' schedules and shifts are displayed in Shifts. Shifts communicates with Reflexis WFM to sync changes that happened in Shifts.
