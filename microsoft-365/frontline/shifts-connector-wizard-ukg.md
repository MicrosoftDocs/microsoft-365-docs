# Use the Shifts connector wizard to connect Shifts to UKG Dimensions (Preview)

## Overview

The Shifts connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with your workforce management (WFM) system. Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in your WFM system from within Shifts.

The wizard creates a connection to your UKG Dimensions system and a connection instance. This applies the sync settings and team mappings you choose. Sync settings determine the schedule information and what entities sync between UKG Dimensions and Shifts. Team mappings define the sync relationship between your UKG instances and teams in Microsoft Teams.

You can create one or more connection instances, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a connection instance with unique sync settings for each location. A UKG instance should only be mapped once to a Microsoft team at any given time. However, it's possible in the wizard to have different connection instances with the same mappings. This means that you can create connection instances with duplicated mappings.

With UKG Dimensions, your frontline workers can efficiently manage their schedules and availability in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use UKG to set up schedules.

## Integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for UKG Dimensions](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-ukg-dimensions) enables you to integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions to manage your schedules and keep them up to date. In this article, we explain how to run the wizard to set up a connection and a connection instance to UKG Dimensions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer, you can use PowerShell to integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to UKG Dimensions](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-setup.md).

### Prerequisites

Before you try the Shifts connector wizard, check that you meet all these prerequisites:

-	Make sure you’re a Microsoft 365 global admin.

-	Know your UKG Dimensions account username, password and these other details:
    - API URL
    - Application key
    - Client ID
    - Client secret
    - Single Sign On (SSO) URL

    If you don't have all this information, contact UKG Dimensions support.

-	Make sure your organization is using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This is the supported identity provider for SSO. To enable SSO, set up integration between Azure AD and UKG Dimensions. For a step-by-step tutorial, see [Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Kronos Workforce Dimensions.](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/kronos-workforce-dimensions-tutorial) If you need help or more information about setting up SSO, contact UKG Dimensions support.

-	Make sure Federated SSO authentication is enabled in your UKG Dimensions environment. Follow the steps below to [configure UKG Dimensions single sign-on](#configure-single-sign-on).

-	Make sure you have at least one team set up in Microsoft Teams.

-	Make sure you’ve added a Microsoft 365 system account (not your personal user account) as team owner to all teams you want to map.

    You can [create this account in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) and assign it a Microsoft 365 license. Then, add the account as a team owner to all teams that you want to map. The Shifts connector uses this account when syncing Shifts changes from UKG Dimensions. We recommend you create an account specifically for this purpose and not use your personal user account.

- Make sure the teams you want to map don't have any schedules in Shifts or UKG Dimensions. If a team has an existing schedule, follow the steps below to [remove schedule entities from the team](#remove-schedule-entities-from-teams-you-want-to-map) before you map a UKG Dimensions instance to it. Otherwise, you'll see duplicate shifts.

### Configure single sign-on

<a name="remove_schedules"> </a>
## Remove schedule entities from teams you want to map

Complete this step if you're mapping UKG Dimensions instances to existing teams with schedule entities. If you're mapping to teams that don't have any schedules or if you've already created new teams to map to, you can skip this step.

Use PowerShell to remove schedule entities from teams.

1. If you don’t have PowerShell installed already, install the PowerShell modules and [set up your PowerShell environment](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-manage.md#set-up-your-environment)

1. Run this command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord -TeamId <Teams team ID> -DateRangeStartDate <start time> -DateRangeEndDate <end time> -ClearSchedulingGroup:$false -EntityType <the scenario entities that you want to remove, the format is @(scenario1, scenario2, ...)> -DesignatedActorId <Teams team owner ID>
    ```

    To get a list of scenarios for the `EntityType` parameter, run [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector). Schedule data will be removed for the date and time range that you specify.

To learn more, see [Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord](/powershell/module/teams/remove-csteamsshiftsschedulerecord).

<a name="email"> </a>

5. Under **Email notification recipients**, choose who receives email notifications about this connection instance. You can add individual users and groups. The email notifications contain information about setup status and any issues or errors that may occur after the connection instance is set up.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you disable a feature by selecting the option **Shifts users will not see provider data**, be aware that:
    >
    > - If the setting **Schedules, groups, shifts, and activities** is disabled, then all other settings, such as **Time off** and **Employee availability**, and more, will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Open shift** is disabled, **Open shift request** will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Time off** is disabled, **Time off request** will also be disabled.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, offer shift requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
    >
    > - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Offer shift requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    >
    > After you run the wizard, make sure you follow the steps in the [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests](#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests) section later in this article.

6. When you're done choosing your settings, select **Next**.

<a name="instances"> </a>
#### Map UKG Dimensions instances to teams

Choose the UKG Dimensions instances that you want to connect to Shifts, and then map each WFM instance to a team in Teams. You can map up to 400 instances.

##### Manually map instances to teams

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of wizard, showing the list of UKG Dimensions instances." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png":::

1. On the **Mapping** page, start by choosing which WFM instance(s) you want to map to Microsoft Teams team(s).

1. Tick the checkbox for each WFM instance you want to map. Instances will only map if you check their boxes.

1. Next, search for and choose the correct Microsoft Teams team.

    Keep in mind that teams that are already mapped to a WFM instance in this connection instance won't be available to map again.

1. Choose the time zone. The closest city will be automatically filled in, but you can change it.

1. When you've mapped all your teams, select **Next**.

##### Use a CSV file to map instances to teams

1. On the **Mapping** page, choose **CSV upload tool**.

2. Select **Download template** to get the CSV mapping file. The template will include a list of all your UKG Dimensions instances and their IDs. The top rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Blank |Blank |Default*|

   And the bottom rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Blank |Blank |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Default*|

3. Choose a team that you want to map to a UKG Dimensions instance. Cut and paste the Team ID and Team Name from the bottom half of your template to be in line with the desired UKG Dimensions instance. A completed row of your template should look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Team ID that you moved |Team Name that you moved |Default*|

Repeat this for all your desired mappings.

4. Enter the correct location in the Time Zone column if needed. 

>[!NOTE]
>The wizard supports approximately 460 locations. The Time Zone needs to be according to the tz format. If the specific location you chose isn't supported, you'll be shown an error in the wizard. Try using the closest city or major city within the same time zone.

5. On the **Mapping** page, select **Browse** to find and upload your completed CSV file.

6. Choose **Done** if your file has uploaded correctly. Otherwise, review the provided error report and upload a corrected file.

7. Your new mappings will appear on the **Mappings** page.

8. Choose **Next**.

### Review and finish

Before finishing, review the summary of the connection instance creation process. If you need to make changes during the connection instance creation process, choose **Back**. When you're ready, select **Finish**.

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review page of the wizard, showing mappings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png":::

The wizard starts the process to set up the connection instance, which may take some time to complete. If you try to edit the connection instance before the setup is complete, you most likely won't be able to view the mappings you created previously.

The email notification recipients you chose will receive email notifications about setup status in case there are any errors.

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, offer shift requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
>
> - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Offer shift requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
>
> After you edit your settings, make sure you follow the steps to [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests.](/microsoft-365/frontline/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests)

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use the Graph API [schedule resource type](/graph/api/resources/schedule) to set the following parameters to ```false``` for each team that you mapped to a UKG Dimensions instance:

- Open shifts: ```openShiftsEnabled```
- Swap requests:  ```swapShiftsRequestsEnabled```
- Time off requests: ```timeOffRequestsEnabled```
- Offer shift requests: ```offerShiftRequestsEnabled```

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to **Settings** in Shifts, and then turn off the **Open shifts** setting.
