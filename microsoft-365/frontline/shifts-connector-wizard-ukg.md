# Use the Shifts connector wizard to connect Shifts to UKG Dimensions (Preview)

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-wizard-intro](includes/shifts-connector-wizard-intro.md)]

### Terms used in this article

|Term |Definition |
|-----|-----------|
|Connection |This is where you configure your UKG Dimensions details by providing your account username, password, and service URLs. This enables access to all your WFM (workforce management) instances created in your UKG Dimensions WFM system. |
|Connection instance |This is where you configure: <br> - The synchronization settings that determine how and which schedule information syncs between UKG Dimensions and Shifts <br> - Team mappings to define the relationship between your WFM instances and teams in Microsoft Teams |
|WFM instance | This term refers to a team within your UKG Dimensions WFM system, which is different than a team in Microsoft Teams. |

## Integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for UKG Dimensions](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-ukg-dimensions) enables you to integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions to manage your schedules and keep them up to date. In this article, we walk you through how to run the wizard to set up a connection and a connection instance to UKG Dimensions through the connector.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use PowerShell to integrate Shifts with UKG Dimensions. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to UKG Dimensions](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-setup.md).

## Before you begin

You must be a Microsoft 365 global admin to run the wizard.

<a name="prerequisites"> </a>
### Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-ukg-prerequisites](includes/shifts-connector-ukg-prerequisites.md)]

- The teams you want to map don't have any schedules. If a team has an existing schedule, [remove the schedule entities from the team](#remove-schedule-entities-from-teams-you-want-to-map) before you map a UKG Dimensions instance to it. Otherwise, you'll see duplicate shifts.

### Configure single sign-on

[!INCLUDE [shifts-connector-ukg-sso](includes/shifts-connector-ukg-sso.md)]

<a name="remove_schedules"> </a>
## Remove schedule entities from teams you want to map

> [!NOTE]
> Complete this step if you're mapping UKG Dimensions instances to existing teams that have schedule entities. If you're mapping to teams that don't have any schedules or if you've already created new teams to map to, you can skip this step.

Use PowerShell to remove schedule entities from teams.

1. First, you'll need to install the PowerShell modules and get set up. Follow the steps to [set up your environment](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-manage.md#set-up-your-environment)

1. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord -TeamId <Teams team ID> -DateRangeStartDate <start time> -DateRangeEndDate <end time> -ClearSchedulingGroup:$false -EntityType <the scenario entities that you want to remove, the format is @(scenario1, scenario2, ...)> -DesignatedActorId <Teams team owner ID>
    ```

    To get a list of scenarios for the `EntityType` parameter, run [Get-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionConnector](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftsconnectionconnector). Schedule data will be removed for the date and time range that you specify.

To learn more, see [Remove-CsTeamsShiftsScheduleRecord](/powershell/module/teams/remove-csteamsshiftsschedulerecord).

## Run the wizard

### Create a connection

1. In the left navigation of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), choose **Setup**, and then under **Featured collections**, select **Frontline workers**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-sync-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sync settings page of the wizard, showing sync settings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-sync-settings.png":::

1. Enter a name for your connection instance. It can't be longer than 100 characters or have any special characters.

  > [!TIP]
  > You'll be given the following options for the next group of settings: <br>
  > **Shifts users will not see provider data**: Data won't sync between UKG Dimensions and Shifts. <br>
  > **Shifts users can see provider data**: Data syncing is unidirectional from UKG Dimensions to Shifts. <br>
  > **Shifts users can see and change provider data**: Data syncing is bidirectional between UKG Dimensions and Shifts.

2. Choose your basic, **Time card**, and **Request** settings from the options listed above.

3. Then, choose your sync frequency.

4. Enter your Microsoft 365 system account. This is the [account that you created as a prerequisite](#before-you-begin) that is a team owner of all the teams you want to map.

<a name="email"> </a>

5. Under **Email notification recipients**, choose who receives email notifications about this connection instance. You can add individual users and groups. The email notifications contain information about setup status and any issues or errors that may occur after the connection instance is set up.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you disable a feature by selecting the option **Shifts users will not see provider data**, be aware that:
    >
    > - If the setting **Schedules, groups, shifts, and activities** is disabled, then all other settings, such as **Time off** and **Employee availability**, and more, will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Open shift** is disabled, **Open shift request** will also be disabled.
    > - If the setting **Time off** is disabled, **Time off request** will also be disabled.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, offer shift requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
    >
    > - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    > - Offer shift requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
    >
    > After you run the wizard, make sure you follow the steps in the [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests](#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests) section later in this article.

6. When you're done choosing your settings, select **Next**.

<a name="instances"> </a>
#### Map UKG Dimensions instances to teams

Choose the UKG Dimensions instances that you want to connect to Shifts, and then map each WFM instance to a team in Teams. You can map up to 400 instances.

##### Manually map instances to teams

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of wizard, showing the list of UKG Dimensions instances." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png":::

1. On the **Mapping** page, start by choosing which WFM instance(s) you want to map to Microsoft Teams team(s).

1. Tick the checkbox for each WFM instance you want to map. Instances will only map if you check their boxes.

1. Next, search for and choose the correct Microsoft Teams team.

    Keep in mind that teams that are already mapped to a WFM instance in this connection instance won't be available to map again.

1. Choose the time zone. The closest city will be automatically filled in, but you can change it.

1. When you've mapped all your teams, select **Next**.

##### Use a CSV file to map instances to teams

1. On the **Mapping** page, choose **CSV upload tool**.

2. Select **Download template** to get the CSV mapping file. The template will include a list of all your UKG Dimensions instances and their IDs. The top rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Blank |Blank |Default*|

   And the bottom rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Blank |Blank |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Default*|

3. Choose a team that you want to map to a UKG Dimensions instance. Cut and paste the Team ID and Team Name from the bottom half of your template to be in line with the desired UKG Dimensions instance. A completed row of your template should look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically pre-filled |Automatically pre-filled |Team ID that you moved |Team Name that you moved |Default*|

Repeat this for all your desired mappings.

4. Enter the correct location in the Time Zone column if needed.

>[!NOTE]
>The wizard supports approximately 460 locations. If the specific location you chose isn't supported, you'll be shown an error in the wizard. Try using the closest city or major city within the same time zone.

5. On the **Mapping** page, select **Browse** to find and upload your completed CSV file.

6. Choose **Done** if your file has uploaded correctly. Otherwise, review the provided error report and upload a corrected file.

7. Your new mappings will appear on the **Mappings** page.

8. Choose **Next**.

### Review and finish

Before finishing, review the summary of the connection instance creation process. If you need to make changes during the connection instance creation process, choose **Back**. When you're ready, select **Finish**.

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review page of the wizard, showing mappings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png":::

The wizard starts the process to set up the connection instance, which may take some time to complete. If you try to edit the connection instance before the setup is complete, you most likely won't be able to view the mappings you created previously.

The email notification recipients you chose will receive email notifications about setup status in case there are any errors.

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, offer shift requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
>
> - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Offer shift requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
>
> After you edit your settings, make sure you follow the steps to [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests.](/microsoft-365/frontline/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests)

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use the Graph API [schedule resource type](/graph/api/resources/schedule) to set the following parameters to ```false``` for each team that you mapped to a UKG Dimensions instance:

- Open shifts: ```openShiftsEnabled```
- Swap requests:  ```swapShiftsRequestsEnabled```
- Time off requests: ```timeOffRequestsEnabled```
- Offer shift requests: ```offerShiftRequestsEnabled```

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to **Settings** in Shifts, and then turn off the **Open shifts** setting.

## Manage your connection and connection instance

After a connection is set up, you can manage and make changes to it in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by using PowerShell.

### Use the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Connector Management Console page lists each connection and connection instance that you've set up, along with information such as health status and sync interval details. You can also access the wizard to create new connections and connection instances and make changes to any of your existing ones. For example, you can update sync settings and team mappings.

To learn more, see [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to UKG Dimensions](shifts-connector-ukg-admin-center-manage.md).

### Use PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to view an error report, change connection settings, disable sync, and more. For step-by-step guidance, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to UKG Dimensions](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-manage.md).
