# Use the Shifts connector wizard to connect Shifts to UKG Pro Workforce Management

## Overview

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for UKG Pro Workforce Management](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-ukg-pro-workforce-management) enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with your UKG Pro Workforce Management (UKG Pro WFM) system. Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in UKG Pro WFM from within Shifts.

In this article, we walk you through how to use the Shifts connector wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center to connect Shifts to UKG Pro WFM.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer, you can use PowerShell to integrate Shifts with UKG Pro WFM. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to connect Shifts to UKG Pro Workforce Management](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-setup.md).

The wizard creates a connection to your UKG Pro WFM system and a connection instance. A connection instance applies the sync settings and team mappings that you choose.

- Sync settings determine the schedule information and what entities sync between UKG Pro WFM and Shifts. 
- Team mappings define the sync relationship between your UKG Pro WFM instances (also called WFM instances) and teams in Teams.

You can create one or more connection instances, each with different sync settings. For example, if your organization has multiple locations with different schedule requirements, create a connection instance with unique sync settings for each location. A WFM instance should only be mapped once to a team in Teams at any given time. However, it's possible in the wizard to have different connection instances with the same mappings. This means that you can create connection instances with duplicate mappings.

With UKG Pro WFM as the system of record, your frontline workers can efficiently manage their schedules and availability in Shifts on their devices. Frontline managers can continue to use UKG Pro WFM to set up schedules.

> [!NOTE]
> UKG Pro Workforce Management was formerly known as UKG Dimensions. You may see references to UKG Dimensions in the wizard.

#### Map WFM instances to teams

Choose the WFM instances that you want to connect to Shifts, and then map each instance to a team in Teams. You can map up to 400 instances.

To complete this step, you can:

- [Manually map WFM instances](#manually-map-wfm-instances-to-teams)
- [Use a CSV file to map WFM instances](#use-a-csv-file-to-map-wfm-instances-to-teams)

##### Manually map WFM instances to teams

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of wizard, showing the list of WFM instances." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg-map.png":::

1. On the Mapping page, start by choosing the WFM instances that you want to map to teams in Teams.

2. Select the checkbox for each WFM instance you want to map. An instance is only mapped if the check box is selected.

3. Next, search for and choose the correct team in Teams.

    Keep in mind that teams that are already mapped to a WFM instance in this connection instance aren't available to map again.

4. Choose the time zone. The closest city is automatically filled in, but you can change it.

5. When you're done mapping all your teams, select **Next**.

##### Use a CSV file to map WFM instances to teams

1. On the Mapping page, choose **CSV upload tool**.

2. Select **Download template** to get the CSV mapping file. The template includes a list of all your WFM instances and their IDs. The top rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically prefilled |Automatically prefilled |Blank |Blank |Default*|

   And the bottom rows of your template will look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Blank |Blank |Automatically prefilled |Automatically prefilled |Default*|

3. Choose a team that you want to map to a WFM instance. Cut and paste the Team ID and Team Name from the bottom half of your template to be in line with the WFM instance that you want. A completed row of your template should look like this:

   |UKG Dimensions Instance ID |UKG Dimensions Instance Name |Team ID |Team Name |Time Zone |
   |------|------|------|------|------|
   |Automatically prefilled |Automatically prefilled |Team ID that you moved |Team Name that you moved |Default*|

    Repeat this step for all your mappings.

4. Enter the correct location in the **Time Zone** column if needed.

    >[!NOTE]
    >The wizard supports approximately 460 locations. The time zone must be in tz format. If the specific location that you chose isn't supported, you'll see an error in the wizard. Try using the closest city or major city within the same time zone.

5. On the Mapping page, select **Browse** to find and upload your completed CSV file.

6. Choose **Done** if your file uploaded correctly. Otherwise, review the error report and upload a corrected file.

7. Your new mappings are listed on the Mappings page. Choose **Next**.

### Review and finish

Before finishing, review the summary of the connection instance creation process. If you need to make changes during the connection instance creation process, choose **Back**. When you're ready, select **Finish**.

:::image type="content" source="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review page of the wizard, showing mappings." lightbox="media/shifts-connector-wizard-review.png":::

The wizard starts the process to set up the connection instance, which may take some time to complete. If you try to edit the connection instance before setup is complete, you most likely won't be able to view the mappings you created previously.

The email notification recipients you chose will receive email notifications about setup status in case there are any errors.

## Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you chose any of the following options to disable open shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, offer shift requests, or time off requests, there's another step you need to do to hide the capability in Shifts.
>
> - Open shifts: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Swap requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Time off requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
> - Offer shift requests: **Shifts users will not see provider data**
>
> After you edit your settings, make sure you follow the steps to [Disable open shifts, open shifts requests, swap requests, and time off requests.](/microsoft-365/frontline/shifts-connector-wizard-ukg#disable-open-shifts-open-shifts-requests-swap-requests-and-time-off-requests)

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use the Graph API [schedule resource type](/graph/api/resources/schedule) to set the following parameters to ```false``` for each team that you mapped to a WFM instance:

- Open shifts: ```openShiftsEnabled```
- Swap requests:  ```swapShiftsRequestsEnabled```
- Time off requests: ```timeOffRequestsEnabled```
- Offer shift requests: ```offerShiftRequestsEnabled```

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to **Settings** in Shifts, and then turn off the **Open shifts** setting.

## Manage your connection and connection instance

After a connection is set up, you can manage and make changes to it in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by using PowerShell.

### Use the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Connector Management Console page lists each connection and connection instance that you've set up, along with information such as health status and sync interval details. You can also access the wizard to create new connections and connection instances and make changes to any of your existing ones. For example, you can update sync settings and team mappings.

To learn more, see [Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to UKG Pro Workforce Management](shifts-connector-ukg-admin-center-manage.md).

### Use PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to view an error report, change connection settings, disable sync, and more. For step-by-step guidance, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to UKG Pro Workforce Management](shifts-connector-ukg-powershell-manage.md).
