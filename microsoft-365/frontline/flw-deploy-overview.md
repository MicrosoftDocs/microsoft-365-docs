# Learn where to start with a frontline deployment

Thanks for choosing Microsoft 365 for frontline workers. Whether you're an independent business or a large multi-national enterprise, Microsoft 365 and Teams for frontline workers can help bring your organization together with tools for communication, collaboration, and productivity. And no matter whether you're just getting into collaboration tools for the first time, or you've already been using Microsoft 365 and Teams for your non-frontline workers, we can help you get up and running.

|Article   |Description   |
|----------|----------|
|[Trial setup for frontline managers](get-up-and-running.md)|If you're a manager of a frontline worker team, you can set up a trial for your frontline workforce from within Microsoft Teams. Admins can learn more about the manager-led setup at: [Manage the Frontline Trial in Teams](flw-trial.md). |
|[Start with a pilot deployment of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers](flw-pilot.md)|Before you commit to a full rollout of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers across your organization, it's a good idea to try it out first with a small set of real people in your organization. |
|[Set up Microsoft 365 for frontline workers](flw-setup-microsoft-365.md)|Follow this setup path if you're an IT pro or responsible for planning, or deploying Teams for Frontline Workers. It walks through preparing your environment, setting up the core of Microsoft 365, and then setting up the services you need for your scenarios. |
|[Deploy Microsoft Teams at scale](deploy-teams-at-scale.md) |Once you've set up Microsoft 365 and assigned licenses to your users, you can use PowerShell to create and manage Teams for your whole frontline workforce. |

After you have set up Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, and any services you need, you can configure Teams and the apps in Teams to support your scenarios. Each of the paths above will walk you through the whole process, from initial setup to a configured team with the apps your users need to start working.
