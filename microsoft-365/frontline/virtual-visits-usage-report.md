# Microsoft Teams Virtual Visits usage report

The Virtual Visits usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of Teams virtual appointment activity in your organization. You can view detailed activity for virtual appointments scheduled through the [Bookings app](bookings-virtual-visits.md) and the [Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector](teams-in-hc.md#virtual-appointments-and-electronic-healthcare-record-ehr-integration).

To view the report, you must be a global admin or Teams admin.

The report contains the following tabs. The information you’ll see in the report depends on whether you have a license for the Bookings app, the Teams EHR connector, or both.

|Tab |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**[Virtual Visits](#virtual-visits)**     |Shows the total number of virtual appointments, with a breakdown of the number of appointments scheduled using the Bookings app and Teams EHR-integrated meetings conducted from your EHR system.         |
|**[Duration](#duration)**     |Shows the average duration of appointments and average lobby wait time of participants.         |
|**[Bookings](#bookings)**     |Shows the number of appointments scheduled through the Bookings app.         |
|**[EHR](#ehr)**     |Shows the number of Teams EHR-integrated appointments conducted from your EHR system.         |  

Use this report to gain insight into virtual appointment activity and trends in your organization. The information can help you optimize virtual appointments to deliver better business outcomes.
