# Get started with Microsoft 365 for Financial Services

Frontline workers in the financial services industry have unique needs for communicating and collaborating based on the services they offer. To get the most benefit for your frontline workforce, you first choose which scenarios Microsoft 365 can help you with in your day-to-day business operations, and then make sure that you prepare your environment with the right fundamentals, teams, and apps to support those scenarios.

1. [Choose your scenarios](#choose-your-scenarios) you want to implement for your business.
2. [Set up Microsoft 365](flw-setup-microsoft-365.md) - Set up Microsoft 365's core elements, Microsoft Teams, and any other services you need.
3. [Configure services and apps](#configure-services-and-apps) - Use team templates to set up the teams you need quickly, including the channels and apps you need for your business. Add in other apps from Microsoft as needed to support your scenarios.

## Choose your scenarios

Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams offer several capabilities that can help financial services organizations with their daily operations and digital transformation. We recommend the following scenarios for financial services organizations:

- [Communicate within and across locations](#communicate-within-and-across-locations)
- [Simplify business processes](#simplify-business-processes)
- [Onboard and train employees](#onboard-and-train-employees)
- [Strengthen corporate communications](#strengthen-corporate-communications)
- [Collaborate on loan applications](#collaborate-on-loan-applications)

> [!NOTE]
> These scenarios are also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services. You can do more with these scenarios when you also use other capabilities from the Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 at [Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services](/industry/financial-services).
