# Shifts for frontline workers

Shifts, the schedule management tool in Teams, keeps your frontline workforce connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective schedule management and communications. With Shifts, frontline managers and workers can seamlessly manage schedules and keep in touch.

Managers can create, update, and manage shift schedules for their teams. They can assign shifts, add open shifts, and approve schedule requests from employees. Employees can view their own and their team's schedules, set their availability, request to swap or offer a shift, request time off, and clock in and out.

## Shifts connectors

If you're using a third-party workforce management (WFM) system for scheduling, you can integrate directly with Shifts through managed Shifts connectors. After you set up a connection, your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in your WFM system from within Shifts.
