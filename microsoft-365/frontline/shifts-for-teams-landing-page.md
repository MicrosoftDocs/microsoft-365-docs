# Shifts for your frontline organization

Shifts, the schedule management tool in Microsoft Teams, keeps your frontline workforce connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective schedule management and communications across your frontline teams. With Shifts and Teams, frontline managers and workers can seamlessly manage schedules, communicate, and collaborate.

Depending on your business needs, your organization can use Shifts as a standalone app or connect it to your workforce management (WFM) system. You can also use other Microsoft services and products to extend the capabilities of Shifts.

## Considerations before you deploy Shifts

As previously mentioned, your organization can opt to use Shifts as a standalone app or connect it to your WFM system. Connect Shifts to your WFM system if you want to:

- Know about the changes made to data through Shifts.  
- Enforce the business rules and logic your organization configured in your WFM system before changes to data made by your frontline are saved to Shifts.  
- Keep data in Shifts and in your WFM system in sync.

Here are options for integrating Shifts with external WFM systems.

|Workforce management system |Solution |Things to consider |

## Deployment overview

Here’s a quick overview for deploying Shifts in your organization.

1. **Create teams for your frontline locations**. You can choose to create your teams using the [deploy frontline dynamic teams at scale](deploy-dynamic-teams-at-scale.md) experience in the Teams admin center.

    To learn more, see [How to find the best frontline team solution for your organization](frontline-team-options.md).

1. **Define Shifts capabilities for your frontline**.

    If you created your teams through the deploy frontline dynamic teams at scale experience, you can choose to [deploy Shifts to your frontline teams at scale](deploy-shifts-at-scale.md) in the Teams admin center. By doing so, you can standardize Shifts settings across all your frontline teams and manage them centrally. You select which capabilities to turn on or off and create schedule groups and time-off reasons that are set uniformly across all your frontline teams.

    Alternatively, you can use the [Create or replace schedule](/graph/api/team-put-schedule?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) Graph API to define Shifts settings for your frontline teams and the [shiftsRoleDefinition](/graph/api/resources/shiftsroledefinition?view=graph-rest-beta) Graph API to [manage permissions to Shifts capabilities for your frontline managers](manage-shifts-permissions-frontline-managers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Optionally, [set up a frontline operational hierarchy](deploy-frontline-operational-hierarchy.md) to map your organization’s structure of frontline teams and locations to a hierarchy in the Teams admin center. Creating a frontline operational hierarchy will enable [location scenarios](set-up-open-shifts-across-locations.md) and other capabilities for your frontline.

## Shifts capabilities

Here’s an overview of what frontline managers and workers can do in Shifts.

|Frontline manager capabilities |Standalone |Microsoft managed Shifts connector|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Create a schedule for their team. <br/>Supported methods:<ul><li>Manually create shifts and time off one by one.</li><li>Bulk creation of shifts and time off through Excel import and copy/paste.</li></ul> | Yes | Not available in Shifts.<sup>1</sup> |
|Create open shifts for workers on their own team to request. <br/>Supported methods:<ul><li>Manually create shifts and time off one by one.</li><li>Bulk creation of shifts and time off through Excel import and copy/paste.</li></ul> | Yes | Not available in Shifts.<sup>1</sup> |
|Create open shifts for workers on other teams (locations) to request. (Preview)<br/>Supported methods:<ul><li>Manually create shifts and time off one by one.</li><li>Bulk creation of shifts and time off through Excel import and copy/paste.</li></ul> | Yes | No |
|Update and delete shifts, time off, and open shifts.<br/>Only manual one by one changes are supported.| Yes | Not available in Shifts.<sup>1</sup> |

<sup>1</sup>Creating, updating, and deleting shifts, time off, and open shifts are actions that frontline managers must do in the WFM system. The data is automatically synced to Shifts through the Shifts connector.<br/>
<sup>2</sup>Depends on how your organization deployed Shifts. This might not be available for the frontline managers to manage locally.<br/>
<sup>3</sup>Automatically configured when you set up the connection between your WFM system and the Shifts connector. No action is needed by frontline managers.<br/>
<sup>4</sup>Automatically created based on the configuration of your WFM system.

|Frontline worker capabilities |Standalone |Microsoft managed Shifts connector|
|---------|---------|---------|
|View their own and their team's schedule. | Yes | Yes |
|View open shifts available in their schedule groups. | Yes | Yes |
|Request open shifts at their own location for manager's approval. | Yes | Yes<sup>1</sup>|
|Request open shifts at other locations for manager's approval at that location. (Preview) | Yes | No|
|Request time off. Currently, after the request is approved by a manager, the time off applies only to the team in which the worker requested it.| Yes | Yes<sup>1</sup>|

<sup>1</sup>Validations are made to ensure rules and business logic from your WFM system are applied.<br/>
<sup>2</sup>Breaks aren't supported in the Teams Shifts connector for UKG Pro Workforce Management.

## Extend Shifts capabilities

Use the following resources to extend Shifts capabilities for your frontline workforce.

|Resource  |Example scenario |Target apps  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[shift Graph API](/graph/api/resources/shift?view=graph-rest-1.0)|Your organization wants to create reports based on Shifts scheduling data. |Apps that want to read/write Shifts data.|
|[Graph API change notifications](/graph/api/resources/change-notifications-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0)|Your organization doesn't require frontline managers' approval for open shift requests. You can use Shifts webhooks notifications to trigger the approval automation process for open shift requests.|Apps that read Shifts data and want to be notified about changes made in Shifts. Additionally, these apps aren’t data owners and don’t have additional validation to run. |
|[Shifts + Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/connectors/shared_shifts/shifts-for-microsoft-teams/)|Your organization wants to take information from Shifts and create custom workflows with other apps and services. For example, create a flow to automatically approve swap shift requests and receive email notifications.|[Learn more](/connectors/shifts).|
