# Microsoft Teams Virtual Appointments usage report

![Information icon](media/info.png) **This feature is moving to [Teams Premium](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams) (Preview). The report will continue to be available during the preview period. After the preview, a Teams Premium license or Teams EHR connector license is required.**

The Virtual Appointments usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of Teams Virtual Appointments activity in your organization. You can view detailed activity for virtual appointments scheduled through the [Bookings app](bookings-virtual-appointments.md) and the [Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector](teams-in-hc.md#virtual-appointments-and-electronic-healthcare-record-ehr-integration).

To view the report, you must be a global admin, Teams admin, Global reader, or Report reader.

The report contains the following tabs. The information you’ll see in the report depends on the license you have.

|Tab |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**[Virtual Appointments](#virtual-appointments)**     |Shows the total number of virtual appointments, with a breakdown of the number of Bookings appointments, Teams EHR-integrated meetings conducted from your EHR system, and premium appointments.         |
|**[Duration](#duration)**     |Shows the average duration of appointments and average lobby wait time of participants.         |
|**[Bookings](#bookings)**     |Shows the number of Bookings appointments, with a breakdown of the number of premium appointments.         |
|**[EHR](#ehr)**     |Shows the number of Teams EHR-integrated appointments conducted from your EHR system.         |

> [!NOTE]
> Premium appointments are appointments that use at least one advanced Virtual Appointments capability available in [Teams Premium](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams) (Preview). For more analytics on advanced Virtual Appointments usage, see the [Advanced Virtual Appointments activity report](advanced-virtual-appointments-activity-report.md).

Use this report to gain insight into virtual appointment activity and trends in your organization. The information can help you optimize Virtual Appointments to deliver better business outcomes.

## View the report

There are two ways to access and view the report in the Teams admin center.

- Through the [**Virtual Appointments usage card**](#the-virtual-appointments-usage-card) in the dashboard
- Directly by choosing [**Virtual Appointments usage**](#the-virtual-appointments-usage-report) in **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**.
