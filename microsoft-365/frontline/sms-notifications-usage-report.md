# Microsoft Teams SMS notifications usage report

![Information icon](media/info.png) **This feature requires [Teams Premium](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams).**

The SMS notifications usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of SMS notifications usage in your organization.

You can track key data for confirmation and reminder text messages sent to external attendees in virtual appointments scheduled by your staff. The report provides information such as date and time sent, notification type, delivery status, and distribution details.

To access the report, you must be a Global admin, Teams admin, Global reader, or Report reader.

## View the report

1. In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, choose **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **SMS notifications usage**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a date range of 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Then, choose **Run report**.

    The report contains the following information:
