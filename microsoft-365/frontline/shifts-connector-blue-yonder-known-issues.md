# Known issues: Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder

This article lists known issues for the [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder).

## You can map an instance to more than one team using PowerShell or your Microsoft 365 admin center

A Blue Yonder Workforce Management instance should only be mapped to one team at any given time in a connection instance.

However, when you use PowerShell or Microsoft 365 admin center to set up a connection instance, it’s possible to map an instance to more than one team. We recommend that you avoid mapping an instance to multiple teams as it can result in syncing issues and unexpected behavior.
