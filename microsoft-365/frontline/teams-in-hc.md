## Provide seamless virtual visits

Use the complete meetings platform in Teams to schedule, manage, and conduct virtual appointments with patients.

- If your organization already uses an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, you can integrate Teams for a more seamless experience. Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector makes it easy for clinicians to launch a virtual patient appointment or consultation with another provider in Teams directly from the EHR system. To learn more, see [Virtual Appointments with Teams - Integration into Oracle Health EHR](ehr-admin-oracle-health.md) and [Virtual Appointments with Teams - Integration into Epic EHR](ehr-admin-epic.md).
- If you aren't using a supported EHR system, you can use the Virtual Appointments app in Teams. To learn more, see [Virtual Appointments with Teams](virtual-appointments.md).

## Connect and engage the healthcare workforce

Bring your health team together to coordinate care and collaborate with Teams.

![Screenshot of Healthcare: Collaborate with your health team in Teams.](media/teams-healthcare-collaborate-in-teams.png)

Teams enables physicians, clinicians, nurses, and other staff to collaborate efficiently with included collaboration features in Teams, such as:

- Set up teams and channels for your health teams and information workers. Use channels with tabs as a way to structure their work, with additional help from tabs to which they can pin information sources.
- Chat, post messages, and communicate. Your team can have persistent conversations about different patients needing attention.
- Call and meet with members of the health team. Set up individual meetings, or use channel meetings to manage daily meetings, both with the power of Teams audio, video, screen sharing, recording, and transcription features.
- Store and share files and documents. Your health team is part of a single virtualized team that works and collaborates on Office documents.

### Secure messaging

Secure messaging supports collaboration within health teams, including several new features:

- A message sender can set a special priority for their message, so the recipient is repeatedly notified until they read the message.
- A message sender can request a read receipt, so they are notified when a message they sent was read by the message recipient.

Together, these features allow quicker attention to urgent messages and confidence that the message was received and read. New health teams using these features can be created on a per-patient basis. These features are policy-based, and can be assigned to individuals or entire Teams.

To learn more, see [Get started with Secure Messaging policies for Healthcare organizations](messaging-policies-hc.md).

Also related to secure messaging is the ability to have other tenants federated by Healthcare organizations, allowing richer inter-tenant communication. To learn more, see [Manage external meetings and chat in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

### Coordinate over email with Exchange Online

Email is a core communication tool for most workplaces. [Set up email with Exchange Online](flw-setup-microsoft-365.md#set-up-email-with-exchange-online) to help your frontline managers and workers coordinate with care team members in other locations or schedule meetings to discuss care plans. Users must have an F3 license to have an email mailbox.

You can also set up shared mailboxes to allow for incoming mail from customers (such as for customer service or scheduling requests) and have a group of workers who monitor and send email from a public email alias like info@contoso.com. For more information about shared mailboxes, see [About shared mailboxes](../admin/email/about-shared-mailboxes.md) and [Open and use a shared mailbox in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd).

## Efficiently manage and motivate care teams

Unburden and empower your teams with seamless shift scheduling, task management, and workflow automation so they can focus on what matters.

### Teams policy packages

Apply Teams policy packages to define what different roles can do in Teams. For example, specify policies for:

- Clinical workers, such as registered nurses, charge nurses, physicians, and social workers, so that they can have full access to chat, calling, shift management, and meetings.
- Information workers in your healthcare organization, such as IT personnel, informatics staff, finance personnel, and compliance officers, can have full access to chat, calling, and meetings.
- Patient rooms, to control settings for patient room devices.

To learn more, see [Teams policy packages for healthcare](/microsoftteams/policy-packages-healthcare?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json).

### Teams templates for healthcare organizations

Teams includes templates designed specifically for healthcare organizations, making it easier to create teams for staff to communicate and collaborate on patient care or operational needs. To learn more, see [Use healthcare team templates](/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/healthcare/healthcare-templates-admin-console?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json).

### Share lists and track information with the Lists app

The Lists app in Teams helps teams track information and organize work. The app is pre-installed for all Teams users and is available as a tab in every team and channel. Lists can be created from scratch, from predefined templates, or by importing data to Excel.

Health teams can use the Patients template to get started. They can create lists to track the needs and status of patients. Existing patient data on Excel spreadsheets can be brought in to create a list in Teams. These lists can be used for scenarios such as rounds and patient monitoring to coordinate care.

For example, a charge nurse creates a patient list in a team that includes all health team members. During rounds, the health team access Teams on their mobile devices and update patient information in the list, which everyone on the team can view to stay in sync. At rounding sessions where the health team gathers to discuss and evaluate key health performance metrics to ensure a patient is on the right glide path to discharge, they can share this information using Teams on a large display screen. health team members who aren't on site can join remotely.

Here's an example list which was set up for patient rounding.

:::image type="content" source="media/lists-patients-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of example list for patient rounding.":::

To learn more, see [Manage the Lists app for your organization in Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-lists-app?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json).

### Track and monitor tasks with the Tasks app

Use [Tasks](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-tasks-app-in-teams-e32639f3-2e07-4b62-9a8c-fd706c12c070) in Teams to track to do items for your whole health team. Your health team can create, assign, and schedule tasks, categorize tasks, and update status at any time, from any device running Teams. IT pros and admins can also publish tasks to specific teams for your organization. For example, you could publish a set of tasks for new safety protocols or a new intake step to be used across a hospital.

To learn more, see [Manage the Tasks app for your organization in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json)

### Streamline approvals with the Approvals app

Use [Approvals](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-approvals-a9a01c95-e0bf-4d20-9ada-f7be3fc283d3) to streamline all of your requests and processes with your team. Create, manage, and share approvals directly from your hub for teamwork. Start an approval flow from the same place you send a chat, in a channel conversation, or from the Approvals app itself. Just select an approval type, add details, attach files, and choose approvers. Once submitted, approvers are notified and can review and act on the request.

You can allow the Approvals app for your organization and add it to your teams. To learn more, see [Manage the Approvals app](/microsoftteams/approval-admin?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json).

### Create, manage, and share schedules with the Shifts app and Frontline Worker integration

Teams integrates with the Shifts app and Frontline Worker, which can be used to coordinate shift staffing features and more. For example, in Shifts, Nurse managers can set up and coordinate schedules for their staff, and nurses can check schedules and swap shifts.

To learn more, see [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/shifts/manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json).
