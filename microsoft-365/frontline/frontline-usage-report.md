# Microsoft Teams frontline usage report

## Overview

You can track usage for all your frontline locations deployed through the [deploy frontline dynamic teams](deploy-dynamic-teams-at-scale.md) experience from the usage dashboard on the Manage frontline teams page in the Teams admin center.

From the usage dashboard, you can:

- Run and view the [frontline usage report](#the-frontline-usage-report). The report shows usage data for active users on Microsoft Teams for each of your frontline locations. You can filter the table to the date range for which you want to see usage data, and then export this data to a CSV file for analysis.
- See the progress of overall frontline deployment tasks on the [Deployment task progress](#deployment-task-progress-card) card.

## Access the usage dashboard

In the Teams admin center, choose **Frontline deployment** > **Manage frontline teams**. From here, there are two ways to get to the usage dashboard.

- Directly, by going to the **Usage** tab.

- Through the **App usage - Microsoft Teams** card. This card shows the overall percentage of users across all your frontline teams that have been active on Teams in the last 30 days. Choose **View details** to go to the dashboard.

To view usage reports in the dashboard, make sure the **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports** setting is turned on in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Otherwise, you'll see a "User details have been hidden by your Microsoft 365 Reports privacy setting" message.

You must be a Global admin to turn on this setting.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and then on the **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
1. Select the **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports** check box, and then choose **Save**.

## The frontline usage report

### Run the report

1. On the **Usage** tab, under **Teams**, select which teams you want in your usage report. Currently, the only option is **All frontline teams**, which represents all teams deployed through the [deploy frontline dynamic teams](deploy-dynamic-teams-at-scale.md) experience in the Teams admin center. We’ll be adding more options in the future.  
1. Under **Date range**, select the date range for which you want to see data. You can choose from the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. Then, choose **Run report**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > It might take several minutes to load the first report of the day. After the report is loaded, it’s available to view for the next 24 hours. Usage data may take up to 72 hours to update.

### Interpret the report

The table shows usage data for your frontline teams during the date range you selected.

:::image type="content" source="media/flw-usage-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the usage dashboard showing the frontline usage report and the Deployment task progress card." lightbox="media/flw-usage-report.png":::

Each row in the table represents a team.

|Item  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Team name |The name of the team.|
|Team ID   |The ID of the team.|
|Total members|The total number of users on each team.|
|Active users|The number of active users on each team. Users are considered active if they signed in to Teams one time during the selected date range. |
|Last activity date    |The last date on which the user signed in to Teams.|

You can:

- Select the **Team members** or **Active users** column header to sort the rows from highest to lowest or vice versa.
- Select the **Last activity date** column header to sort the rows from latest to earliest or vice versa.
- Add or remove columns in the table by selecting **Edit columns** (the gear icon) in the upper-right corner of the table.
- Export the data to a CSV file for further analysis by selecting the **Export to Excel** icon in the upper-right corner of the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you haven't deployed any frontline locations through the [deploy frontline dynamic teams](deploy-dynamic-teams-at-scale.md) experience in the Teams admin center, you won't see any teams.

## Deployment task progress card

The **Deployment task progress** card on the usage dashboard shows you which of the following tasks for your overall frontline deployment are completed, in progress, and not started.

- Map frontline attributes
- Deploy frontline teams
- Set up operational hierarchy
- Deploy Shifts

:::image type="content" source="media/flw-usage-report-task.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment task progress card.":::

For your completed tasks, you can select **Review** to manage setup. For tasks that aren't started, you can choose **Start** to begin the task. The progress indicator shows the percentage of total tasks that are completed.

## Troubleshoot errors

If an error occurs when retrieving data, select **Try Again** on the data table or refresh the page.
