## Create custom apps for your organization's needs

Add Power Apps to create low-code or no-code apps for your organization. You can build custom apps to connect your business data, so you can manage inventory or conduct store walks, for example.

> [!TIP]
> Examples are given for the financial services, healthcare, nonprofit, and retail industries, but apply to an organization in any sector.

|Industry |Example |
|:--------|:-------|
|Financial services |Create an app for relationship and account managers to track calls and emails to clients. |
|Healthcare |Create an app to track consumables inventory in exam rooms to make sure all rooms are ready for patients. |
|Retail | Create an app to manage and track your inventory, or to conduct store walks where a person in charge checks all areas of a store before opening. |
|Manufacturing |Create an app to track machinery and equipment inspections and repair needs. |

## Track key performance indicators (KPIs) with Power BI reports

Share and collaborate on interactive Power BI content in Microsoft Teams channels and chats. You can add the Power BI app to Teams to embed interactive reports and chat in Teams about your reports.
