## Create custom apps for your organization's needs

Add Power Apps to create low-code or no-code applications for your organization. You can build custom apps to connect your business data, so you can manage inventory or conduct store walks, for example.

> [!TIP]
> Examples are given for the financial services, healthcare, nonprofit, and retail industries, but you can use these apps for an organization in any sector.

|Industry |Example |
|:--------|:-------|
|Financial services |You can create an app for relationship and account managers to track calls and emails to clients. |
|Healthcare |You can create an app to track consumables inventory in exam rooms to make sure all rooms are ready for patients. |
|Retail | You can create an app to manage and track your inventory, or to conduct store walks where a person in charge checks all areas of a store before opening. |
|Manufacturing |You can create an app to track machinery and equipment inspections and repair needs. |

More information: [Power Apps](/microsoftteams/manage-power-platform-apps) and [Power Apps and Microsoft Teams integration](/powerapps/teams/overview).

## Track key performance indicators (KPIs) with Power BI reports

Share and collaborate on interactive Power BI content in Microsoft Teams channels and chats. You can add a [Power BI tab](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs) to Teams to embed interactive reports and chat in Teams about your reports, and get notified when important things happen in Power BI right in your Teams activity feed.
