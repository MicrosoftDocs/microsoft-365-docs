# Help your frontline workers track time and attendance

Now that your organization has begun using Shifts to manage schedules, you'll need to make sure that your frontline workers understand how to track their time and attendance.

Use your [corporate communications strategy](flw-corp-comms.md) to share Shifts training content with your team and make sure they have access to the resources they need:

1. Share the [Shifts video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-shifts-f8efe6e4-ddb3-4d23-b81b-bb812296b821) with your team to help them understand the basics.
2. Share [Videos for frontline managers](#shifts-videos-for-managers) with your managers to help them set up and manage schedules for their teams.
3. Share [Videos for users](#shifts-videos-for-users) with all of your frontline staff to help them perform regular tasks such as clocking in and swapping shifts.
