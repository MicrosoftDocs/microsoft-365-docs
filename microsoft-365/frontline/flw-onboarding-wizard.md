# Use the Frontline Worker onboarding wizard to get your frontline workforce up and running

## Overview

The Frontline Worker onboarding wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center simplifies onboarding frontline workers to your organization. The wizard lets you quickly deploy an experience in Microsoft Teams that's tailored to your frontline workforce. Using the wizard, you can easily kick off your pilot deployment of Teams for the frontline workers in your organization.

The wizard sets up a team for your frontline workers and assigns licenses and [policy packages](/microsoftteams/policy-packages-flw?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json) to each team member. You can create your team from scratch or from a [team template](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console), and then you add users and assign roles. The role determines the policy package that the wizard assigns to each user.

Currently, the wizard supports adding 100 users each time you run it. We're working on increasing the number of users per run soon. Check back here for the latest updates.

The wizard is available to all organizations that have at least one [F license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline). You can run the wizard as many times as you need to roll out Teams to your frontline workforce in different locations or sites across your organization.

Check out this short video for an overview of how to run the wizard to onboard your frontline workforce.

> [!NOTE]
> The wizard doesn't support [sensitivity labels](/microsoftteams/sensitivity-labels) yet. If your organization requires sensitivity labels to create a team, you won't see the wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Run the wizard

1. In the left navigation of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), choose **Setup**. Go to the **Apps and email** section, and then under **Get your frontline workforce up and running**, Play the **Video** to learn more about the capabilities that Microsoft 365 for frontline workers offers.

2. When you're ready, select **Get started** to run the wizard.

3. Enter a name for your team, add one or more team owners, and select a privacy setting. Then, choose whether to create your team from scratch or from a team template. Team templates come with predefined channels and tabs, which optimize the team for a particular business need or project.

4. Add users to the team. You can also add groups. If you add groups, keep in mind that licenses and policy packages are directly assigned to each user in the group, not the group itself.

5. Assign one of the following roles to each team member: Frontline Worker, Frontline Manager, None.

    By assigning a Frontline Worker or Frontline Manager role, that user will receive a policy package. The policy package will create an experience in Teams that's tailored to their role. This experience includes pre-pinned apps and policies for healthy frontline worker and manager communication and collaboration.

    Next, select a location and assign a Microsoft 365 F license to each team member. If you donâ€™t have enough licenses, you can select **Buy more licenses** to purchase more licenses.  

6. Choose who receives the status email after the wizard is completed. The email contains success and failure information about the actions performed by the wizard&mdash;creating the team, adding team members, and assigning a license and policy package to each team member. Use this information to troubleshoot any errors that may occur.

7. Review your selections, and then select **Confirm**.

    The wizard creates your team and assigns licenses and policy packages to team members. It may take a few minutes to complete, after which the recipients you chose receive a status email.

8. You're on your way but you're not done yet! Next, check out the [What to do after running the wizard](#what-to-do-after-running-the-wizard) section of this article.

## What to do after running the wizard

After you run the wizard, it's important to:

- Let your frontline workers and managers know that they're assigned Teams licenses.
- If your organization uses shared devices, make sure Teams is installed on those devices. Users that you added to the team will receive a welcome email that prompts them to open Teams.
- If your organization uses a "bring your own device" (BYOD) model, let each user you added to the team know that they have to download and install Teams to their devices. They'll also receive a welcome email that prompts them to download Teams.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Keep in mind that users who have F1 licenses won't receive a welcome email because the F1 license doesn't include email access.  

When the frontline employee opens Teams for the first time, they'll receive a tailored first run experience, which includes chats and channels, calling, and task management all within Teams.
