# Virtual appointments with Microsoft Teams

With virtual appointments in Microsoft Teams, you have a complete meeting platform to schedule, manage, and conduct virtual appointments. For example:

- Financial advisors, claims adjusters, and other financial professionals can meet with clients remotely.
- Sales associates, product experts, and design consultants can conduct virtual fittings and consultations.
- Clinicians can meet with patients or other healthcare providers to discuss medical care.

This article gives you an overview of the capabilities available in Teams for scheduling and managing virtual appointments.

- [The Bookings app](#the-bookings-app), for every organization.
- [The Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector](#teams-electronic-health-record-ehr-connector), for healthcare organizations who use an EHR system.

## The Bookings app

The [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5) in Teams offers a simple way to schedule and manage virtual appointments. Use it to schedule virtual appointments such as financial consultations, healthcare visits, interviews, customer support, virtual fittings and consultations, and education office hours.

Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees.

Each virtual appointment contains a Teams meeting link thatâ€™s sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a web browser or in Teams on any device.

- [Help your clients and customers use virtual appointments](virtual-appointments-toolkit.md)

## Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector

If your healthcare organization uses an EHR system, you can use the Teams EHR connector to integrate Teams for a more seamless virtual care experience. The Teams EHR connector requires an active subscription to Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare or a subscription to Microsoft Teams EHR connector standalone offer.

After you set up the Teams EHR connector, clinicians can launch visits with patients and consultations with other providers in Teams directly from the EHR system.

Currently, the Teams EHR connector supports integration with the Cerner EHR system and Epic EHR system. To learn more, see:
