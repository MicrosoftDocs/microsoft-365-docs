# Get started with Microsoft 365 for retail organizations

Retail environments, with their rotating schedules and on-the-go staff, have very different needs than other organizations. To get the most benefit for your retail organization, you first choose which scenarios Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams can help you with in your day-to-day business operations, and then make sure that you prepare your Teams environment with the right fundamentals, teams, and apps to support those scenarios.

1. [Choose your scenarios](#choose-your-scenarios) you want to implement for your business.
:::image type="content" source="media/retail-teams-scenarios.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Teams scenarios for retail." lightbox="media/retail-teams-scenarios.png":::
2. [Set up Microsoft 365](flw-setup-microsoft-365.md) - Set up Microsoft 365's core elements, Microsoft Teams, and any other services you need.
3. [Configure services and apps](#configure-services-and-apps) - Use team templates to set up the teams you need quickly, including the channels and apps you need for your business. Add in other apps from Microsoft as needed to support your scenarios.

## Choose your scenarios

Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams offer several capabilities that can help retail organizations with their daily operations and digital transformation. We recommend the following scenarios for retail organizations:

[![In-store communication and collaboration.](media/retail-scenarios-in-store.png)](#in-store-communication-and-collaboration) [![Cross-store communication and collaboration.](media/retail-scenarios-cross-store.png)](#cross-store-communication-and-collaboration) [![Virtual fittings and consultations.](media/retail-scenarios-virtual-visits.png)](#virtual-fittings-and-consultations) [![Simplify business processes.](media/retail-scenarios-business-processes.png)](#simplify-business-processes) [![Corporate communications.](media/retail-scenarios-corp-comms.png)](#corporate-communications) [![Onboarding new employees.](media/retail-scenarios-onboarding.png)](#onboarding-new-employees)

> [!NOTE]
> These scenarios are also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Retail. You can do more with these scenarios when you also use other capabilities from the Microsoft Cloud for Retail, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 at [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](/industry/retail).

### Retail templates for teams

Create teams that include a predefined set of settings, channels, tabs, and pre-installed apps for communication and collaboration within an individual store, with a region, or between headquarters and your staff wherever they are.

- The Retail **Organize a store** template includes channels for General, Shift Handoff, Store Readiness, and Learning, and includes the Approvals, Tasks, and Wiki apps.
- The **Retail for managers** template includes channels for General, Operations, and Learning, and includes a Wiki tab.

You can also [create a custom template](/microsoftteams/create-a-team-template) to include the apps your store needs. More information: [Get started with Retail team templates](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-retail-teams-templates?bc=/microsoft-365/frontline/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/microsoft-365/frontline/toc.json)

## Get ready to roll out your scenarios - identify roles and responsibilities for scenarios

Now that you know what scenarios you want to implement and what you need to support them, you can gather your team so you can plan, roll out, and monitor how they're working in your organization. For example, the following roles might be needed to roll out these scenarios in your organization:

| Image | Role | Responsibilities | Department |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
|<img src="/office/media/icons/administrator.png" alt="Administrator symbol."> | IT Administrator | Work with operations and retail management staff to define scenarios and how they'll work for the organization. <br><br>Configure settings in the Teams admin center, such as policies and templates, and enable apps. <br><br>Set up app settings (such as global Shifts settings) for the organization. <br><br>Add and license users.  | IT department |
|<img src="/office/media/icons/user-monitor.png" alt="User monitor symbol.">| Operations staff | Work with Administrators to define scenarios, and determine which settings, policies, templates, and apps are needed for Teams. <br><br>Create regional or divisional teams from templates. <br><br>Set up tasks, lists, and approval flows for coordination between stores within a region, or between stores and headquarters. <br><br>Set up learning framework for staff. | Central operations |
|<img src="/office/media/icons/presenter-teams.png" alt="Presenter symbol."> | Store manager | Work with Administrators and Operations staff to define scenarios. <br><br>Create teams for the store from templates. <br><br>Set up channels and apps for the teams, as needed. For example: a channel for shift handovers. <br><br>Set up store schedules in Shifts. <br><br>Set up tasks, lists, updates, and approval flows that are specific to the store. <br><br>Set up learning tasks for staff. | Store management |
