# Get started with Microsoft 365 for retail organizations

Retail environments, with their rotating schedules and on-the-go staff, have very different needs than other organizations. To get the most benefit for your retail organization, first choose which scenarios Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams can help you with in your day-to-day business operations, and then make sure that you prepare your Teams environment with the right fundamentals, teams, and apps to support those scenarios.

1. [Choose your scenarios](#choose-your-scenarios) you want to implement for your business.
:::image type="content" source="media/retail-teams-scenarios.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Teams scenarios for retail." lightbox="media/retail-teams-scenarios.png":::
2. [Set up Microsoft 365](flw-setup-microsoft-365.md) - Set up Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, and any other services you need.
3. [Configure services and apps](#configure-services-and-apps) - Use team templates to set up the teams you need quickly, including the channels and apps you need for your business. Add in other apps from Microsoft as needed to support your scenarios.

## Choose your scenarios

Microsoft 365 and Teams offer capabilities that can help retail organizations enhance productivity in their daily operations and digital transformation. We recommend the following scenarios for retail organizations:

[![In-store communication and collaboration.](media/retail-scenarios-in-store.png)](#in-store-communication-and-collaboration) [![Cross-store communication and collaboration.](media/retail-scenarios-cross-store.png)](#cross-store-communication-and-collaboration) [![Virtual fittings and consultations.](media/retail-scenarios-virtual-visits.png)](#virtual-fittings-and-consultations) [![Simplify business processes.](media/retail-scenarios-business-processes.png)](#simplify-business-processes) [![Corporate communications.](media/retail-scenarios-corp-comms.png)](#corporate-communications) [![Onboarding new employees.](media/retail-scenarios-onboarding.png)](#onboarding-new-employees)

> [!NOTE]
> These scenarios are also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Retail. You can do more with these scenarios when you also use other capabilities from the Microsoft Cloud for Retail, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 at [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](/industry/retail).

## Get ready to roll out your scenarios - identify roles and responsibilities for scenarios

Now that you know what scenarios you want to implement and what you need to support them, you can gather your team so you can plan, roll out, and monitor how they're working in your organization. For example, the following roles might be needed to roll out these scenarios in your organization.

| Image | Role | Responsibilities | Department |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
