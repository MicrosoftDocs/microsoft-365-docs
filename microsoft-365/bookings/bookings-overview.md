# Microsoft Bookings

Microsoft Bookings makes scheduling and managing appointments a breeze. It helps you schedule and manage appointments with your customers, clients, or colleagues. Whether you need to book time to meet people or set aside time for different meetings, Bookings makes it easy and convenient for both you and your attendees. Bookings includes a web-based booking page, which is integrated with Outlook to optimize your calendar and give your customers the flexibility to book a time that works best for them. Email and SMS text notifications reduce no-shows and enhance customer satisfaction. Your organization saves time with a reduction in repetitive scheduling tasks. With built-in flexibility and ability to customize, Bookings can be designed to fit the situation and needs of many different parts of an organization. 

Bookings is also available as an app in Teams and Outlook, which allows you to create Booking pages, declare your availability, add team members, and both schedule new and manage existing appointments.

## Microsoft Bookings lets you conduct virtual meetings

Use Bookings to make your organization’s meetings virtual with online meetings via [Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/overview-of-the-bookings-app-in-teams-7b8569e1-0c8a-444e-b712-d9968b05110b) Each appointment booked as an online meeting creates a unique meeting link that is sent to attendees so they can join via a web browser, phone dial-in, or the Skype or Teams app.

## Personal Bookings

Personal bookings is how you manage your own appointment timeslots, it allows you to easily configure and share your availability with your customers, clients, or colleagues. You can be in charge of your own time and avoid the back and forth of scheduling. You can also set aside time for specific activities by creating meeting types. Once you publish your personal booking page, you can share the link with anyone who can then see your availability and easily schedule a time when you're free and is convenient for them.

## Shared Bookings

Shared bookings allows you to invite your team members and create booking pages and let your customers book time with you and your team. It contains various settings to define services, manage staff members, configure schedules and availability, business hours and customize how appointments are scheduled. These pages can be customized to fit the diverse needs of your organization. 

## Bookings data and compliance

All Bookings data is stored within the Microsoft 365 platform and in Exchange Online. Bookings follows all data storage policies that are set by Microsoft, which are the same policies that all apps in Microsoft 365 follow. Bookings uses shared mailboxes in Exchange to store customer, staff, service, and appointment details. Compliance policies for shared mailboxes in Exchange also apply for Bookings mailboxes. All customer data (including information provided by customers when booking) is captured in Bookings and is stored within the app, thus it's stored within Exchange Online.
