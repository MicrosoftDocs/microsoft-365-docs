# Microsoft Bookings

Microsoft Bookings makes scheduling and managing appointments a breeze. Bookings includes a web-based booking calendar and integrates with Outlook to optimize your staff’s calendar and give your customers flexibility to book a time that works best for them. Automated notification emails reduce no-shows and enhance customer satisfaction, and organizations save time with a reduction in repetitive scheduling tasks. With built in flexibility and ability to customize, Bookings can be designed to fit the situation and needs of many different parts of an organization. The Bookings calendar is a mailbox in Exchange Online.

Bookings provides you the ability to make your organization’s meetings virtual with online meetings via [Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/overview-of-the-bookings-app-in-teams-7b8569e1-0c8a-444e-b712-d9968b05110b) and Skype for Business. Each appointment booked as an online meeting creates a unique meeting link that is sent to attendees so they can join via a web browser, phone dial-in, or the Skype or Teams app. Bookings is also available as an app within Teams, which allows you to create Bookings calendars, assign staff, and both schedule new and manage existing appointments without ever leaving Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookings is on by default for customers who have the Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 A3, and Microsoft 365 A5 subscriptions. Bookings is also available to customers who have Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Office 365 Enterprise E5, but it is turned off by default. To get started, see [Get access to Microsoft Bookings](get-access.md). To turn Bookings on or off, see [Turn Bookings on or off for your organization](turn-bookings-on-or-off.md).

Bookings has three primary components:

- A booking page where your customers and clients can schedule appointments with the staff member who should provide the service or run the appointment. This web-based scheduling page can be shared via a direct link, your Facebook page, and even through link embedding within your website.

- A web app that contains a set of web-based, business-facing pages where Bookings calendar owners and administrators within an organization can define appointment types and details, manage staff schedules and availability, set business hours, and customize how appointments are scheduled. These pages allow for versatility and the ability to customize a Bookings calendar to fit the diverse needs of the person or organization.

- A business-facing mobile app where Bookings calendar owners and administrators can see all of their appointments, access customer lists and contact information, and make manual bookings on the go.
