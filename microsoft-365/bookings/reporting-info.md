# Reporting information for Shared Bookings

You can now see a four month view of your shared booking page in a TSV file. The TSV file will show you four months of data, but you can select different four month periods over the course of a year.

This appointment level information can be used to visualize the customer activity around your shared booking page. TSV files are tab separated value files. You can view or edit a file like this with any text editor or spreadsheet program, such as Excel.

1. In Microsoft 365, select the App launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

1. On the Shared Bookings home page, select **Export**.

1. On the **Export recent data** page, select your date range and select **Export**.

1. Save the file with a new name, and specify .xls or xlsx format.

1. Open the file to see the four month view of your shared booking page.
