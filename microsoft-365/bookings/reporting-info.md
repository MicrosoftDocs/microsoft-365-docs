# Reporting info for Bookings

You can now see a four month view of your Bookings calendar in a TSV file. The TSV file will show you four months of data, but you can select different four month periods over the course of a year.

This appointment level information can be used to visualize the customer activity around your Bookings calendar. TSV files are tab separated value files. You can view or edit a file like this with any text editor or spreadsheet program, such as Excel.
