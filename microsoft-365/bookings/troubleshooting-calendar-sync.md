# Troubleshooting: This staff member's calendar can't be synced

If you receive the error, "This staff member's calendar can't be synced", this article contains several troubleshooting procedures to help you resolve the error.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookings is turned on by default for customers who have the Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 A3, or Microsoft 365 A5 subscriptions. Bookings is also available to customers who have Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Office 365 Enterprise E5, but it is turned off by default. To get started, see [Get access to Microsoft Bookings](get-access.md). To turn Bookings on or off, see [Turn Bookings on or off for your organization](turn-bookings-on-or-off.md).

If you are looking for information on syncing your staff's calendar, see [Sync staff's work calendar with Microsoft Bookings](sync-staff-work-calendar.md).

## The staff member needs to change their calendar permissions

In order for Bookings to properly sync with your staff members' calendars, each staff member must share their calendar. Each staff member must follow these instructions to share their own calendar.

1. Sign in to Microsoft 365, and then select **Outlook** from the app launcher.

1. At the top of the page, select **Share** \> **Calendar**.

1. In the **People inside your organization** section, select the drop-down box next to **My Organization**, and then select **Can view when I'm busy**.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting shares your free/busy information with Bookings and with other users in your organization. It does not include any other information, such as what type of appointment you have scheduled, who you have scheduled the appointment with, or the location.

1. Select **Done**.

## We can't find that staff member in our organization

If an employee has left your company and you removed them from your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization, you still need to remove that user from Bookings so they won't show up in the calendar and to prevent customers from booking appointments with them.

1. Sign in to Microsoft 365, and then go to **Bookings** \> **Staff**.

1. Hover your mouse cursor over the staff member's name. **Edit** and **delete** icons appear to the right of the **Phone** column.

1. Select the **Delete** icon.

1. In the confirmation box, select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have more than one booking calendar, you must remove the user from all of them.

To check if you have more than one calendar, in the left menu, select the drop-down arrow next to your company name, and then select **Open**. If you only have one calendar, then you will see only the option to add a booking calendar. This example shows that there is a second calendar named "Contoso CO".

## There's a syncing error we can't identify

This is a transient error and typically occurs because of an unstable internet connection. These problems usually resolve themselves after a few minutes.

If you still see this error after an extended period of time or you are seeing it often, please contact support.
