# Delete a Shared Booking page

This article explains how you can delete an unwanted shared booking page. You can delete the shared booking page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or you can use PowerShell. The shared booking page is a mailbox in Exchange Online so you delete the corresponding user account to delete the shared booking page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All shared booking pages that you created in 2017 or before must be deleted using the PowerShell instructions on this topic. All shared booking pages created in 2018 or after can be deleted in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only M365 Admins can delete shared booking pages created by end users. We do not support the capability of deleting shared booking pages at a user level. If a user wishes to do so, the request will have to be routed to the respective M365 admin.

The shared booking page is where all relevant information is stored, including:

- Business information, logo, and working hours added when the shared booking page was created
- Relevant staff and services added when the shared booking page was created
- All bookings and time off appointments added to the shared booking page once it was created.

> [!WARNING]
> Once a shared booking page is deleted, this additional information is also permanently deleted and can't be recovered.
