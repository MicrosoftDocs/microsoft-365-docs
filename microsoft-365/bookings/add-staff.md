# Add team members to Bookings

The Staff page in Bookings is where you create your staff list and manage staff member details such as name, phone number, and email address. You can also set working hours for each staff member from here. Note, a staff member is a team member.

This article covers the key steps required to add staff members to a shared booking page.

## Before you begin

Although Bookings is a feature of Microsoft 365, not all of your staff members are required to have a Microsoft 365 account. All staff members must have a valid email address so they can receive bookings and schedule changes.

## Steps

1. From the Bookings homepage, navigate to the Shared Bookings section, and select the booking page you wish to add team members to.

2. Go to staff option in left pane and select **Staff**, and then **Add new staff**.

3. When adding staff from within your organization, type their name in the search field and select them when they appear in the drop-down menu. The other fields will automatically populate.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To add staff from outside of your organization, manually fill in their email and other information. Staff from outside your tenant will not be able to share free/busy information with Bookings.

4. For each staff member, select a role: Team member, Scheduler, Viewer, or Guest. To learn more about staff roles, see [Understanding staff roles](staff-roles.md).

5. Select **Notify all staff via email when a booking assigned to them is created or changed** to enable staff emails. The following is an example email:

    :::image type="content" source="media/bookings-notify-all-email.jpg" alt-text="A notification email from Bookings.":::

6. Select **Events on Microsoft 365 calendar affect availability** if you want the free/busy information from staff members’ calendars to impact availability for booking services through Bookings.

    For example, if a staff member has a team meeting or a personal appointment scheduled for 3pm on a Wednesday, Bookings will show that staff member as unavailable to be booked in that time slot. That time will appear as busy or tentative in the Bookings Page view, as shown in the below example.

    :::image type="content" source="media/bookings-busy-tentative-view-2.png" alt-text="A view of a Bookings Page." lightbox="media/bookings-busy-tentative-view-2.png":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This setting is turned on by default. We highly recommend leaving this setting on to avoid double-bookings and to optimize the availability of your staff members.

7. Select **Use business hours** to set all bookable times for your staff members to be only within the business hours that you set in the **Business hours** section on the Business Information page. To learn more about configuring staff availability, see [Configure staff availability in Microsoft Bookings](staff-availability.md).

    By deselecting this box, staff can be given custom hours that further limit when they can be booked. This is helpful for scenarios where a staff member may only be on site Tuesdays and Wednesdays, or they dedicate their mornings for one type of appointments, and their afternoons for other types.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Bookings supports up to 100 staff members in a Bookings Page.

## Make a Bookings user a super user without adding them as Staff in Bookings

You may want to add a person to your staff list in Bookings without making them available to customers or clients. Once you make them a super user, they'll become an administrator of the booking mailbox. Being an administrator of a booking mailbox is defined as having full access and send-as permissions to the booking mailbox.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps only work if the user being added isn't already assigned a **viewer** role in Bookings.

1. [Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/connect-to-office-365-powershell#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

2. Using PowerShell, assign full access with the following commands:

    ```powershell
    Add-MailboxPermission -Identity <bookingmailbox@emailaddress> -User <adminusers@emailaddress> -AccessRights FullAccess -Deny:$false
    ```

    By default, the mailbox gets automatically mapped to Outlook. If you do not want the booking mailbox to appear in the user's Outlook, assign full access with the following commands:

     ```powershell 
    Add-MailboxPermission -Identity <bookingmailbox@emailaddress> -User <adminusers@emailaddress> -AccessRights FullAccess -Deny:$false -AutoMapping:$false
    ```

3. And then run this command to assign send-as permissions.

    ```powershell
    Add-RecipientPermission -Identity <bookingmailbox@emailaddress> -Trustee <adminusers@emailaddress> -AccessRights SendAs -Confirm:$false
    ```

Here's an example PowerShell command to add Allie Bellew to the Contoso daycare booking mailbox.

1. First run this command:

    ```powershell
    Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "daycare@contoso.com" -User "Allie Bellew" -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All
    ```
     By default, the mailbox gets automatically mapped to Outlook. If you do not want the booking mailbox to appear in the user's Outlook, assign full access with the following commands:
     
      ```powershell
    Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "daycare@contoso.com" -User "Allie Bellew" -AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping:$false -InheritanceType All
    ```

2. Then run this command:

    ```powershell
    Add-RecipientPermission -Identity "daycare@contoso.com" -Trustee "Allie Bellew" -AccessRights SendAs -Confirm:$false
    ```

**Allie Bellew** now has administrator access, but doesn't appear as bookable staff in Bookings.
