# Microsoft Bookings metrics and activity tracking

Various metrics are available on the main Bookings page, allowing you to easily track revenue and customer activity.

| Metric | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Bookings activities | The 30-day activity period shows the last 30 days, including today. **Bookings made**, **Estimated revenue**, and **Customers booked** are all calculated. |
| Bookings made | The number of bookings that are either taking place today or have taken place in the last 30 days. You may use this information to see if you’re meeting your estimated sales expectations and to forecast for the next 30 days. |
| Estimated revenue | This shows the estimated revenue the you’ve earned through Bookings. This is calculated based on the price that you’ve defined for each service. This is an estimate because you may have charged a different fee at service time, the fee was set to an hourly charge, you’ve gotten tips, or a customer hasn't paid yet. For example, if your service is charging $10 per hour and the booking is 2 hours long, Bookings will only estimate $10 for that service.<br/><br/>**Important:** This is only an estimate and does not guarantee your actual revenue. |
| Customers booked | The number of customers who have booked appointments for today and for the last 30 days.<br/><br/>**Note:** This metric shows the number of customers who have booked appointments, not the total number of appointments. For example, if one customer booked three appointments in the last 30 days and two more customers made one booking each, you’ll see 3 customers booked. |
