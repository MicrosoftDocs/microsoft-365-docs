# Manage group attendees in Bookings

Owners and staff members of a Bookings calendar can now manage and update attendees for group services. For more information on service offerings in Bookings, see [Define your service offerings in Bookings](define-service-offerings.md).

Make sure that you set the **Maximum number of attendees** to more than 1 on the Bookings service.

## Update attendee list

> [!NOTE]
> You must have Administrator or Team member permission before you can update these settings.

1. In Microsoft 365, select the app launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

2. Choose your calendar, select the group meeting and choose **Edit**.

3. To add attendees to the group booking, select **Add customer**.

4. To remove attendees, select the user you want to remove from the group booking and select **Remove customer**. Once you remove the attendee, they'll get an email letting them know that they've been removed from this booking.

## Common issues

- Editing of a group booking service from the Teams app or from the mobile app resets attendees to 1. Use the Bookings web app to edit the group booking service.

- Group bookings doesn't support resource bookings at this time.
