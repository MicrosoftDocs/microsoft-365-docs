# Employee working hours in Microsoft Bookings

Setting employee working hours ensures that their availability is accurately shown when your customers try to book them. By default, the working hours for each of your employees match the business hours you've established in the Microsoft Bookings app. See the "Set your business hours" section of [Enter business information](enter-business-information.md).

On the **Staff** page, you can customize employee working hours to match the needs of your business and employees.

If you want to book time off for staff members so customers can't book them while they're out of the office, see [Schedule business closures, time off, and vacation time](schedule-closures-time-off-vacation.md) for instructions.

## Customize employee working hours

1. In Microsoft 365, select the app launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Staff**, select the staff member whose hours you want to set, and select **Edit staff**.

1. Under **Availability**, turn off the **Use business hours** toggle.

1. Use the dropdowns to select start and end times for each day. Manually type in times less than half hour increments.

1. Select **Save changes**.

## Set an employee's days off

When you schedule a day off for an employee, that employee appears unavailable on the booking page. Customers using the booking page are unable to schedule them for service on that day.

1. In Microsoft 365, select the app launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Staff**, select the staff member whose hours you want to set, and select **Edit staff**.

1. Under **Availability**, turn off the **Use business hours** toggle.

1. Select the trash can icon next to the day that the employee has off.

   If you want to schedule a day that was previously marked as a day off, select the **+** sign next to the day you want to schedule.

1. Select **Save changes**.

> [!TIP]
> If you're scheduling employee vacation time or other large blocks of time off, see the "Schedule employee time off" section of [Schedule business closures, time off, and vacation time](schedule-closures-time-off-vacation.md#schedule-employee-time-off).
