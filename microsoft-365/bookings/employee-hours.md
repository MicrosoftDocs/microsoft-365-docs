# Employee working hours in Microsoft Bookings

Setting employee working hours ensures that their availability is accurately shown when your customers try to book them. By default, the working hours for each of your employees match the business hours you've established in the Microsoft Bookings app. See the "Set your business hours" section of [Enter business information](enter-business-information.md).

On the **Staff** page, you can customize employee working hours to match the needs of your business and employees.

If you want to book time off for staff members so customers can't book them while they're out of the office, see [Schedule business closures, time off, and vacation time](schedule-closures-time-off-vacation.md) for instructions.

## Set an employee's days off

When you schedule a day off for an employee, that employee will appear unavailable on the booking page. Customers using the booking page will be unable to schedule him or her for service on that day.

1. On the working hours screen, select the **x** next to the day that the employee will have off.
