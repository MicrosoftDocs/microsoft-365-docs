# Add a marketing campaign ID to a Bookings page URL

Keep track of your Bookings marketing campaigns by adding a campaign ID to the end of your Booking page URL.

Use a campaign ID to see how your marketing campaigns are doing. Add a campaign ID you choose to the end of your Bookings page URL and use the campaign ID in your different marketing platforms to see which of your campaigns are connecting with customers.

## Add campaign ID

1. In Microsoft 365, select the App launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

2. Choose your calendar and in the left navigation pane, select **Booking page** and copy your booking page URL and paste it into a text editing program, like Notepad.

3. Add a campaign ID to the end of the Booking page URL. For example, if your booking page URL looks like this, [https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/), you would choose an ID to add to the end. For example, if you wanted to track your booking details from your Twitter page, you could add Twitter to the end of the URL. The new URL that you would add to your Twitter page would look like this: [https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/?RefID=Twitter](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/?RefID=Twitter). Use different campaign IDs to track the marketing campaigns you're running.

> [!NOTE]
> Characters in the campaign ID must be one of the following: alphanumeric characters, underscore or hyphen. Make sure you test your Campaign ID url by copying and pasting into a web browser.

## Track campaign IDs

You can track how your campaigns are doing by downloading a report (TSV file) that shows you the last four months of activities of your Bookings calendar. The TSV file will show you four months of data, but you can select different four month periods over the course of a year. For more information on how to download the report, see [Reporting info for Bookings](reporting-info.md).
