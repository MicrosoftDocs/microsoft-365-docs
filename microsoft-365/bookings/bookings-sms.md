# Configure SMS text notifications and reminders in Microsoft Bookings

With Microsoft Bookings, you can set up SMS text notifications to be sent to the person booking an appointment. You can set up SMS notifications in Bookings in the Bookings web app or Bookings app in Teams. Attendees, customers or partners can also opt in or out of getting SMS notifications on the self-serve booking page. They can also opt out of receiving SMS notifications by replying **STOP** to the sender.

The SMS notifications will include the Teams meeting link for virtual booking appointments.

## Before you begin

Attendees, customers or partners need a valid United States or Canada phone number before they can receive SMS notifications.

## Configure SMS notification in Microsoft Bookings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Bookings will have unlimited SMS notifications for customers with Bookings licenses until Feb 28, 2022. As we get closer to the end of the promotion period, we will provide additional details on licensing requirements. For more info on Bookings licensing, see [Bookings licensing](/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-faq?view=o365-worldwide#who-has-access-to-microsoft-bookings-).

You can configure SMS notification in Bookings in a couple of ways:

- In the Bookings web app, follow the steps to **Enable text message notifications** in the [Define your service offerings in Bookings](define-service-offerings.md) topic.

- In the Booking app in Teams, navigate to **Settings** > **Appointment type** > **Add appointment type** and select **Send them text messages**.

## Tracking and metrics for SMS notifications

> [!NOTE]
> You need to be a Teams admin to see Teams and Bookings data on the Teams admin center.

You can track key data on SMS notifications usage in your organization in the Teams admin center. Usage reports includes data such as time and date sent, origin number, message type, event type and delivery status. You can use SMS notification telemetry during the promotional period to help forecast and budget for SMS notifications after March 1, 2022.

1. On the Teams admin center, **Virtual Visits SMS notifications**.

2. On the **Analytics & Reports** page, select SMS notifications usage.
