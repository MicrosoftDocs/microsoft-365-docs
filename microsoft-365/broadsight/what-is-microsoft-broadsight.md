# What is Microsoft Broadsight

Project for the web is a new service that is now available to Office 365 users.  You can make it available to your users through the following licenses:

- Project Plan P1
- Project Plan P3 (previously called Project Online Professional)
- Project Plan P5 (previously called Project Online Premium)

If your users are currently using Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium licenses, Project for the web is available to them now. 

This article provides admins information to help them better understand and manage the service.
