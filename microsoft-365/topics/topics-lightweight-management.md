# Topics lightweight management in Viva Engage

Topics lightweight management allows you to experience how Topics can enhance knowledge management in your organization without needing a license that includes Topics.

Topics provides a central knowledge base for manually created topics and definitions inside apps like Viva Engage. These topics don't use Topics' AI, topic cards and pages but can be selected to classify conversations and posts in Viva Engage. Knowledge admins can edit, create, and delete these topics without Viva licensing as a way to make knowledge management more accessible to more users.

## Permissions

[Learn about how permissions work for Topics in Viva Engage.](/viva/topics/topic-experiences-viva-engage#topics-permissions-and-licenses)

>[!NOTE]
>You don't need a Topics license for the lightweight management experience.

## Manage topics

You need to be a Viva Engage admin to manage topics in the **Manage topics** page.

You can access your lightweight management experiences by replacing "your-domain" with your domain in the following URL:
`https://your-domain.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/TopicsManagement.aspx`

### Create a new topic

1. Go to your **Manage topics** page and choose **New topic**.
1. Give your topic a name and a description, and choose **Create**.

### Edit a topic

1. Go to your **Manage topics** page.
1. Find the topic you want to edit and select the Edit icon.
1. Make any changes to the name or description and choose **Publish**.

### Remove a topic

1. Go to your **Manage topics** page.
1. Find the topic you want to remove and select the **X** icon.
1. You can remove multiple topics at once by selecting all the desired topics and choosing **Remove**.

>[!NOTE]
>Removed topics can't be restored.

## Get the full experience

Enable advanced management experiences and AI technology to enhance the central knowledge base in your organization by [purchasing a license that includes Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics).

After you purchase a Topics license, you won't be able to use the lightweight management experience. You'll be prompted to complete Topics setup in your Microsoft 365 admin center when you visit the lightweight management page.

Once you complete your [Topics setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md), you'll be automatically redirected to the [premium management page in the Topic center](manage-topics.md) from the lightweight management page.
