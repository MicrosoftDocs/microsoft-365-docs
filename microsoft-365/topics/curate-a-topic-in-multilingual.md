# Curate Multilingual topics in Topics

The Multilingual feature in Topics allows you to curate and edit a topic page in English, French, German, and Spanish.

> [!NOTE]
> A topic page must be created and curated in the tenant's default language before it can be curated to a different language using the Multilingual feature in Topics.

## Curate Multilingual content into a topic page

To curate a multilingual topic page, open a topic page, and select **Multilingual** on the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the topic center home page or from a topic highlight in your tenant.

1. On the Multilingual panel, find the desired language and select **Create**.

3. To edit the newly created Multilingual topic page, select **Edit** on the command bar on the topic page.

     Make sure you're in the correct topic page by looking at the notification banner that will appear on the upper-left of the page. Complete the curating fields in the selected language.

4. Confirm or edit the topic name on the Multilingual topic page. If the topic name is the same in the new language, keep the current topic name.

5. In the **Context hint** section, add a hint relevant to the current topic in the selected language.

7. In the **Short description** section, describe the topic in the selected language.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding another language page for an existing topic, there are fields you can only edit in the originally created language topic page. These fields include: Confirmed people, Pinned files and pages, Related sites, and Related topics.
>
> To edit these fields, save or publish your changes on the Multilingual topic page and visit the topic's default language page and continue editing if needed.

## View a published Multilingual topic page

To view a published Multilingual topic page, select a language option on the upper-right language menu of the topic page.

## Language settings

Topics honors users' language preference language setting from their account profile to present topics metadata. For example, if a user's preferred language is Spanish, Spanish metadata will be presented on topic card, topic picker, topic answer and other topics experiences if available, or tenant default language (mostly in English) metadata will be presented.

Languages can be changed or updated through settings in the apps.

## Create a topic in a language other than the default language

If a topic already exists in your organization, you can create a new version of it in another language.

1. From your Topic center, choose **+New** and select **Topic Page**.
2. Give your topic a name, and select your desired language.
