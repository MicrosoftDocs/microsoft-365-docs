# Merge topics in Topics

You can merge multiple topics into one if Topics identifies different topics that refer to the same thing.

>[!NOTE]
>Merging topics is currently in targeted release.

## Prerequisites

- Have a license that includes Topics
- Be a knowledge manager

## Merge topics in the topic center

1. In your Topic center, select which topics you want to merge. Then choose **Merge** from the command bar. You may also be prompted to merge topics if Topics detects that two topics have the same name.

    >[!NOTE]
    > You can't merge multiple published topics together, but you can merge suggested or confirmed topics into an existing published topic.

2. This will take you to the **Merge Topics** dialog, where you can see the topics that will merge, along with their pre- and post-merge status. Topics determines the post-merge status based on information about the original topics.

3. If everything looks right, select **Merge topics**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Merging topics can't be undone. Topics can't be edited while they're merging.

4. You'll be taken to the new topic page of the merged topic.

5. The original topic will show in your **Removed topics** page, where it will only be accessible to knowledge managers. Topics that have been merged will say **Merged** rather than **Removed**. You can filter your removed topics to show only topics that have been merged.
