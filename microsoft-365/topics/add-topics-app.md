# Add the Topics app in the Teams Admin Center

Once your organization has a Viva Suite or Copilot license, you’ll automatically have access to the Topics app in the Microsoft Teams app store.

## Manage and pin the Topics app

1. Sign into your Microsoft Teams admin center.

2. Go to Teams apps, then choose Manage apps.

3. Scroll down or search for Topics. Here you can view the Topics app details, permissions, and settings.

4. In the left rail, select Permission policies. Here you can choose what users have access to the Topics app.

5. Next, select Setup policies from the left rail. Add setup policies to control how apps are made available to users in Teams. [Learn more about app setup policies](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies). It’s recommended to [pin the app](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#pin-apps) for your users so they can find it easily.
