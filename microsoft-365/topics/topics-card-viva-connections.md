# Use Topics cards in the Viva Connections dashboard

Use Topics cards to encourage knowledge discoverability, engagement, and sharing. Topics has two different cards that can be used on the Viva Connections dashboard. Viva Connections is a personalized employee experience that surfaces the most important content and tools from across your organization. Learn more about [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview) and [how to set up a dashboard](/viva/connections/create-dashboard). 

## Topics cards

There are two separate Topics cards for two separate intentions. The **Topics Contribute card** can be used to reach people who are known knowledge resource owners and are already engaged with knowledge areas. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewers interests, current projects, and expertise. The **Topics Discover card** can be used to view topics and knowledge areas for people who could be interested in learning more or contributing to a topic. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewer’s interests, current projects, and expertise. 

## The Topics Contribute card

The Contribute card can be used to reach people who are known knowledge resource owners and are already engaged with knowledge areas. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewers interests, current projects, and expertise. When viewers engage with the Contribute card, they will be presented a quick view that will let them accept or reject topic association suggestions. Clicking on the topic name or resources will direct users to the topic page where they can view and contribute to the topic. [Learn more about how to edit an existing topic](edit-a-topic.md).
