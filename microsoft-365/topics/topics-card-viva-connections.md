## Topics cards

There are two separate Topics cards for two separate intentions. The **Topics Contribute card** can be used to reach people who are known knowledge managers and are already engaged with topics and knowledge areas. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewers interests, current projects, and expertise. The **Topics Discover card** can be used to view topics and knowledge areas for people who could be interested in learning more or contributing to a topic. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewer’s interests, current projects, and expertise. 

## The Topics Contribute card
