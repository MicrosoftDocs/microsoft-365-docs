In order to work in the topic center, you need to have the required permissions. Your admin can assign these permissions to users during [knowledge management setup](set-up-knowledge-network.md), or new users can be added afterwards.

Topic center users can be given two sets of permissions:

- **Create and edit topics**: Create new topics or update topic content such as the description, documents and associated persons
- **Manage topics**: Use the Topic management dashboard to review topics across the organization. Users can perform actions such as confirming and rejecting unconfirmed topics.

A user can be given both sets of permissions, or only one if needed. 

If a user is not given permissions during setup, an admin can do the following give users permissions through the Microsoft 365 admin center:

To give a user permissions to manage topics:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Set up**.
2. In the **Organizational Knowledge** section, under **Connect people to knowledge**, select **View**.
3. On the **Connect people to knowledge** page, select **Manage**.
4. On the **Knowledge Network** page, select the **Topic permissions** tab.
5. On the **Topic permissions** tab, under **Who can manage topics**, select **View**.
6.  On the **Who can manage topics** page, add the user to the **Only selected users or security groups** box.
7. After adding your user, select **Add**.
3. Under the **Who can create and edit topics**, select **View**.
4. Add the user to the **Only selected users or security groups** box.
5. Select **Add**.

To give a user permissions to create and edit topics:

1. On the **Topic permissions** tab, under **Who can create and edit topics**, select **View**.
2. Add the user to the **Only selected users or security groups** box.
3. Select **Add**.
