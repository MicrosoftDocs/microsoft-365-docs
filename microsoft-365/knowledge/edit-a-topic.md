# Edit an existing topic 

</br>

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4LA4n]  

</br>

In Microsoft Viva, you can edit an existing topic. You may need to do this if you want to correct or add additional information to an existing topic page. 

When you edit a topic, the information that you add to a topic (instead of added by AI) will be visible to all users who have permission to view the topic.

## Requirements

To edit an existing topic, you need to:
- Have a Topic Experiences license.
- Have permissions to [**Who can create or edit topics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/knowledge/topic-experiences-user-permissions). Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Knowledge Network topic permissions settings. 

> [!Note] 
> Users who have permission to manage topics in the Topic center (knowledge managers) already have permissions to create and edit topics.

## How to edit a topic page

Users who have the **Who can create or edit topics** permission can edit a topic by opening the topic page from a topic highlight, and then selecting the <b>Edit</b> button on the top right of the topic page.

Knowledge managers can also topics directly from the Manage Topics page by selecting the topic, and then selecting <b>Edit</b> in the toobar.

You can also "unpin" them by selecting the <b>Remove from list</b> icon on the user card.
