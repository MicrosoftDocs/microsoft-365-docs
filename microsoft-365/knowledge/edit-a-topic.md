# Edit an existing topic in Microsoft Viva Topics 

</br>

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4LA4n]  

</br>

In Viva Topics, you can edit an existing topic. You may need to do this if you want to correct or add additional information to an existing topic page. 

> [!Note] 
> While information in a topic that is gathered by AI is [security trimmed](topic-experiences-security-trimming.md), note that topic description and people information that you manually add when editing an existing topic is visible to all users who have permissions to view topics. 

## Requirements

To edit an existing topic, you need to:
- Have a Viva Topics license.
- Have permissions to [**Who can create or edit topics**](./topic-experiences-user-permissions.md). Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Viva Topics topic permissions settings. 

> [!Note] 
> Users who have permission to manage topics in the Topic center (knowledge managers) already have permissions to create and edit topics.

## How to edit a topic page

Users who have the **Who can create or edit topics** permission can edit a topic by opening the topic page from a topic highlight, and then selecting the <b>Edit</b> button on the top right of the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the topic center home page where you can find all the topics that you have a connection to.

Knowledge managers can also edit topics directly from the Manage Topics page by selecting the topic, and then selecting <b>Edit</b> in the toolbar.

You can also "unpin" them by selecting the <b>Remove from list</b> icon on the user card.
