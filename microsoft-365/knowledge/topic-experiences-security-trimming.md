# Topic Experiences security trimming (Preview)

> [!Note] 
> The content in this article is for Project Cortex Private Preview. [Find out more about Project Cortex](https://aka.ms/projectcortex).

Topic experiences users will not be able to view information in topics that their existing Office 365 permissions prevents them from seeing. Everything a user sees on a topic page (for example, SharePoint sites, documents, files) will be information they are already allowed to see. Topic experiences does not make changes to any existing permissions.

## Why two users may have different views of the same topic

When a topic is created through AI or manual curation, it can contain a description of the topic, alternative names, people associated with the topic, as well as sites, pages, and files related to the topic. When this information is viewed on a topic page, it is possible that two users who are viewing the same topic my not see the same information.
  
For example, when User 1 views the Neptune topic page, this is what they might see.

![Neptune topic for user 1](../media/knowledge-management/user2-topic-view.png) </br> 

However, when User 2 looks at the same Neptune topic page, her view differs from User 1.  User 2 is able to see the *DG-2000 Product Overview* file in the **Pinned files and pages** section of the topic page, which does not appear for User 1. 

![Neptune topic for user 2](../media/knowledge-management/user1-topic-view.png) </br> 

The difference in what users may see on the same topic is because users may not have the Office 365 permissions to view a related site or file.  Topic experiences respects the permissions that are set on items in a topic, and cannot change access to them. In our example, User 1 is not able to view the *DG-2000 Product Overview* file in their topic page for Neptune because User 1 does not have Office 365 permissions to view the file.

If a user is not able to see enough information in a topic for it to be useful, the topic will not be available to the user. In this instance, the user will not see the highlighted topic. However, a different user who has permissions to more information in the topic for it to be useful, will be able to see the topic.


## Topic permissions for knowledge managers and topic contributors

Users that are assigned permissions to manage topics - knowledge managers - will only be able to view information they have permissions to see within topics.

Similarly, users who have create and edit topic permissions - topic contributors - will only be able to view information they have permissions to see within topics. 


## AI versus manually curated topic information

Topics can contain information generated by AI and information added or edited by topic contributors or knowledge managers.

 - Information in a topic that was added by AI is only visible to people who have access to the source content.
 - Information that has been manually added or edited by a topic contributor or knowledge manager is visible to everyone who can see the topic.

The following table describes what users - topic viewers, contributors, and knowledge managers - can see in a given topic based on their permissions.

|Topic item|What users can see|
|:---------|:------------------|
|Topic name|Users can see the topic name of all topics in the topic center. Some topics may not be visible if they have a low relevancy to the user.|
|Topic description|AI-generated descriptions are visible only to users who have permissions to the source content. Manually entered or edited descriptions are visible to all users.|
|People|Pinned people are visible to all users. Suggested people are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Files|Files are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Pages|Pages are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Sites|Sites are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
