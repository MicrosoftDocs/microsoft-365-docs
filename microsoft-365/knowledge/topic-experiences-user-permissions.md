# Manage topic permissions in Microsoft 365

You can manage topic permissions settings in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). You must be a global administrator or SharePoint administrator to perform these tasks.

## To access topics management settings:

2. On the **Services** tab, click **Knowledge network**.
