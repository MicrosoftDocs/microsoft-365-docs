# Manage topic permissions in Microsoft Viva Topics

You can manage topic permissions settings in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). You must be a global administrator or SharePoint administrator to perform these tasks.

With topic permissions settings you can choose:

- Which users can manage topics: Access the topic management center and view feedback on topics as well as move topics through the lifecycle.

## To access topics management settings:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, click **Settings**, then **Org settings**.
2. On the **Services** tab, click **Topic experiences**.
