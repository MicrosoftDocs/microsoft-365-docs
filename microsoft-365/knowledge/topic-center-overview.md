# Topic center overview in Microsoft Viva Topics

In Microsoft Viva Topics, the topic center is a modern SharePoint site that serves as a center of knowledge for your organization. It's created during [Viva Topics setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

The topic center has a default home page with the **Topics** web part where all licensed users can see the topics to which they have a connection.

While all licensed users who can view topics will have access to the topic center, knowledge managers can also manage topics through the **Manage topics** page. The **Manage topics** tab will only display to users who have the Manage topics permissions.

## Where is my topic center

The topic center is created during Viva Topics setup. After setup completes, an admin can find the URL on the [Topic center management page](./topic-experiences-administration.md#to-access-topics-management-settings).


1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings**, and then select **Org settings**.
2. On the **Services** tab, select **Topic Experiences**.

On the topic center home page, you can see the topics in your organization to which you have a connection.

- Suggested connections - You will see topics listed under **We've listed you on these topics. Did we get it right?** These are topics in which your connection to the topic has been suggested through AI. For example, you might be an author of a related file or site. You are asked to confirm that you should stay listed as a related person for the topic.

- Confirmed connections - These are topics in which you are pinned on the topic page or you've confirmed a suggested connection to the topic. Topics will move from the suggested to confirmed section when you confirm a suggested connection.

Once a user confirms their connection to a topic, the user can make edits to the topic page to curate their connection. For example, they can provide more information about their connection to the topic.

## Manage topics page

To work on the **Manage topics** page of topic center, you need to have the required Manage topics permissions needed for the knowledge manager role. Your admin can assign these permissions to users during [Viva Topics setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md), or new users can be [added afterwards](topic-experiences-knowledge-rules.md) by an admin through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

On the **Manage topics** page, the topic dashboard shows all the topics, you have access to, that were identified from your specified source locations. Each topic will show the date the topic was discovered. A user who was assigned Manage topics permissions can review the unconfirmed topics and choose to:

- Confirm the topic: Indicates to users that an AI-suggested topic has been validated by a human curator.

- Publish the topic: Edit the topic information to improve the quality of the topic that was initially identified, and highlights the topic to all users who have view access to topics.

- Remove the topic: Makes the topic undiscoverable to end users. The topic is moved to the **Removed** tab and can be confirmed later if needed.

For more information about how to manage topics on the **Manage topics** page, see [Manage topics](manage-topics.md).

## Create or edit a topic

If you have Create and edit topics permissions, you can:

- [Edit existing topics](edit-a-topic.md): You can make changes to existing topic pages that were created through discovery.

- [Create new topics](create-a-topic.md): You can create new topics for ones that were not found through discovery, or if AI tools did not find enough evidence to create a topic.
