# Overview

## Learn how to contribute

Anyone who is interested can contribute to the articles. When you contribute, your work goes into the content set after it's been reviewed and merged. It's then published to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/), and you're listed as a contributor at: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/graphs/contributors>.

### Quickly update an article using GitHub.com

Contributors who make infrequent or small updates can edit the file directly on GitHub.com without installing any software. This article shows you how. [This two-minute video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1XQTG) also covers how to contribute.

> [!TIP]
> To edit an article, you need to get to it on the GitHub.com backend. If you're already on the GitHub.com page of the article, you're starting at step 4.
>
> Your permissions in the repo determine what you see in step 5 and later. People with no special privileges see the steps as described. People with permissions to approve their own pull requests see a similar experience with different button and page titles (for example, **Commit changes** instead of **Propose changes**), extra options for creating a new branch, and fewer confirmation pages. The point is: click any green buttons that are presented to you until there are no more.

1. Verify that you're signed in to GitHub.com with your GitHub account.
2. On learn.microsoft.com, find the article that you want to update.
3. Above the title of the article, select ![Edit this document icon.](microsoft-365/media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit this document**.

4. The corresponding article file opens on GitHub. Select ![Edit this file icon.](microsoft-365/media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit this file**.

5. The article file opens in a line-numbered editor page where you can make updates.

   Articles on learn.microsoft.com are formatted using the Markdown language. For help on using Markdown, see [Mastering Markdown.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

   Select **Preview** to view your changes as you go. Select **Edit** to go back to making updates.

   When you're finished making changes, select the green **Commit changes** button.

6. In the **Propose changes** dialog that opens, review and/or enter the following values:
   - **Commit message**: This value is required. You can accept the default value ("Update \<filename\>") or you can change it.
   - **Extended description**: This value is optional. For example:
     - An explanation of the changes.
     - @ include the GitHub alias of someone to review and merge your changes.

   When you're finished on the **Propose changes** dialog, select the green **Propose changes** button.

7. On the **Comparing changes** page that opens, select the green **Create pull request** button.

   ![Screenshot of how to select the green Create pull request button on the Comparing changes page.](microsoft-365/media/quick-update-comparing-changes-page.png)

8. On the **Open a pull request** page that opens, review the title and comments, and then select the green **Create pull request** button.

9. That's it. There's nothing more for you to do.

   The article owner (identified in metadata) is notified about the changes to the article. Eventually, the article owner or another party will review, possibly edit, and approve your changes. After your pull request is merged, the article is updated on learn.microsoft.com.
